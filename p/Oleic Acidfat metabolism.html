Dietary factors can influence the expression of key genes connected to insulin resistance, , and adipose tissue composition. In this study, our objective was to determine gene expression and fatty  (FA) profiles in visceral adipose tissue (VAT) from lean and morbidly obese individuals. We also aimed to study the agonist effect of dietary factors on glucose .Lean and low and high insulin resistance morbidly obese subjects (LIR-MO and HIR-MO) were included in this study. The gene expression of liver X receptor type alpha (LXR-α) and glucose transporter type 4 (GLUT4) and the FA profiles in VAT were determined. Additionally, the in vivo and in vitro agonist effects of  (OA), linoleic  (LA), and arachidonic  (AA) by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor type gamma 2 (PPAR-γ2) on the activity of GLUT4 were studied.Our results showed a dysregulation of GLUT4 and LXR-α in VAT of morbidly obese subjects. In addition, a specific FA profile for morbidly obese individuals was found. Finally, AA was an PPAR-γ2 agonist that activates the expression of GLUT4.Our study suggests a dysregulation of LXR-α and GLUT4 expression in VAT of morbidly obese individuals. FA profiles in VAT could elucidate their possible role in lipolysis and adipogenesis. Finally, AA binds to PPAR-γ2 to activate the expression of GLUT4 in the HepG2 cell line, showing an alternative insulin-independent activation of GLUT4.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30592064>The Lentiviral System Construction for Highly Expressed Porcine Stearoyl-CoA Desaturase-1 and Functional Characterization in Stably Transduced Porcine Swine Kidney Cells.</a></h1><p>The most highly regulated and abundant fatty  in animal tissue is  (18:1n9).  is synthesized by the Δ9 desaturase, stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD1), which is responsible for the synthesis of the putative cytokine palmitoleic  (16:1n7) and 18:2 cis-9, trans-11 conjugated linoleic . Owing to the importance of SCD1 in , we generated porcine swine kidney (SK6) transgenic cell lines for sustained overexpression or knockdown of porcine stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (pSCD1) in an inducible manner by utilizing a lentiviral expression system. We successfully validated these cell culture models for expression and functionality of pSCD1 by documenting that the pSCD-transduced cells overexpressed pSCD1 protein and mRNA. Additionally, the pSCD1-transduced cells increased the conversion of palmitate (16:0) to palmitoleic  nearly fourfold. The lentiviral vectors utilized in this study can be further used to generate transgenic animals to document the effects of the overexpression of SCD1 on obesity and steatosis.© 2018 AOCS.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30923965>Sources of microbial oils with emphasis to Mortierella (Umbelopsis) isabellina fungus.</a></h1><p>The last years a constantly rising number of publications have appeared in the literature in relation to the production of oils and fats deriving from microbial sources (the "single cell oils"-SCOs). SCOs can be used as precursors for the synthesis of -based biofuels or employed as substitutes of expensive oils rarely found in the plant or animal kingdom. In the present review-article, aspects concerning SCOs (economics, biochemistry, substrates, technology, scale-up), with emphasis on the potential of Mortierella isabellina were presented. Fats and hydrophilic substrates have been used as carbon sources for cultivating Zygomycetes. Among them, wild-type M. isabellina strains have been reported as excellent SCO-producers, with conversion yields on sugar consumed and  in DCW values reported comparable to the maximum ones achieved for genetically engineered SCO-producing strains. Lipids produced on glucose contain γ-linolenic  (GLA), a polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA) of high dietary and pharmaceutical importance, though in low concentrations. Nevertheless, due to their abundance in , these lipids are perfect precursors for the synthesis of 2nd generation biodiesel, while GLA can be recovered and directed to other usages. Genetic engineering focusing on over-expression of Δ6 and Δ12 desaturases and of C16 elongase may improve the fatty  composition (viz. increasing the concentration of GLA or other nutritionally important PUFAs) of these lipids.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30835849>Extraction Technology Can Impose Influences on Peanut Oil Functional Quality: A Study to Investigate the  by Sprague-Dawley Rat Model.</a></h1><p>In this study, peanut oil was prepared by cold pressing (temperature under 60 °C), hot pressing (temperature above 105 °C), and enzyme-assisted aqueous extraction technology. Influences of an extraction technology on the oil fatty  composition and the content of minor bioactive compounds, including tocopherols, polyphenols, and squalene, were investigated in detail. High--diet Sprague-Dawley (SD) rat model was then established to probe the impact of cold-pressed peanut oil (CPO), hot-pressed peanut oil (HPO), and enzyme-assisted aqueous-extracted peanut oil (EAO) on  outcomes, to explore influences of different extraction technologies on  functional quality. Results showed that  was the predominate fatty  in the EAO (52.57 ± 0.11%), which was also significantly higher (P < 0.05) than CPO and HPO. The HPO showed higher total tocopherol and polyphenol contents (206.84 ± 6.93 mg/kg and 47.87 ± 6.50 mg GA/kg, respectively) than CPO and EAO (P < 0.05). However, the squalene content in CPO was 475.47 ± 12.75 mg/kg, which was the highest among the three oils (P < 0.05). The animal experiment results revealed that EAO could be more prone to induce  accumulation in the liver, which may likely to cause nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. However, the serum  profiles indicated that the CPO was more beneficial than the EAO and HPO in lowering the serum low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, alanine aminotransferase, and aspartate aminotransferase contents, and increasing the high-density lipoprotein cholesterol content. All of our efforts indicated that an extraction technology can affect the peanut oil  fatty  composition, the bioactive compounds content, and, correspondingly, the  in SD rats.© 2019 Institute of Food Technologists®.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30834410>Dietary zerumbone from shampoo ginger: new insights into its antioxidant and anticancer activity.</a></h1><p>The dietary sesquiterpene dienone zerumbone (ZER) selectively targets cancer cells, inducing mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis, and protects non-cancerous cells towards oxidative stress and insult. This study examines the in vitro effects of ZER on  peroxidation in biological systems (cholesterol and phospholipid membrane oxidation) and explores its antitumor action in terms of its ability to modulate cancer cell  profile. Evaluation of the antioxidant activity of ZER showed that this compound is unable to trap lipoperoxyl radicals per se. ZER significantly modulated the total  and fatty  profiles in cancer cells, inducing marked changes in the phospholipid/cholesterol ratio, with significant decreases in the levels of  and palmitic acids and a marked increase of stearic . Cell-based fluorescent measurements of intracellular membranes and  droplets using the Nile Red staining technique showed that in cancer cells, ZER induced significant accumulation of cytosolic  droplets and altered cell membrane organization/protein dynamics, depolarizing the mitochondrial membranes and inducing apoptosis and alteration of nuclear morphology. The modulatory activity of ZER on the total  and fatty  profiles and  droplets may therefore represent another possible mechanism of its anticancer properties.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30550084>[The becoming of reactions of lipolysis in phylogenesis. The palmitic and  triglycerides as substrates. Insulin, condition of normolipemia and formation of hyper lipoproteinemia type IIb, IV and V].</a></h1><p>According to phylogenetic theory of general pathology, when living in ocean all were carnivorous (piscivorous) fatty acids transferring to cells in form of non-polar triglycerides nitially began apoB-48 chylomicrons, continued lipoproteins of very low and low density and fnalized its apoB-100 endocytosis. The fatty acids are transferred by chylomicrons + lipoproteins of very low density + lipoproteins of low density and non-polar triglycerides are hydrolyzed by hepatic glycerolhydrogenase and co-enzyme apoC-III; according WHO classifcation, hyperlipoproteinemia corresponds to type V. On land, in herbivorous who are not yet synthesized insulin, apoB-48 and chylomicrons left process of non-polar triglycerides transferring. In lipoproteins of very low density and lipoproteins of low density, the carnivorous transfer exogenous palmitic non-polar triglycerides. The herbivorous also transfer palmitic non-polar triglycerides though synthesized by hepatocytes from glucose endogenically. In herbivorous, transferring of palmitic non-polar triglycerides prior to synthesis of insulin is forming apoB-100 in composition of lipoproteins of very low density and lipoproteins of low density. The hydrolysis of palmitic non-polar triglycerides in lipoproteins of very low density is activated by hepatic glycerol hydrogenase and apoC-III; cells absorb lipoproteins of low density by means of apoB-100 endocytosis. The content on lipoproteins in blood plasma under electrophoresis of lipoproteins corresponds to hepatic glycerol hydrogenase type IIb. In frst and second types of fatty acids transferring in form of triglycerides to lipoproteins of very low density + lipoproteins of low density predominate palmitic fatty , triglycerides of the same name and palmitic  of fatty acids in vivo. The insulin initiated the third type of transferring of  fatty  by now to insulin-depended cells only in  lipoproteins of very low density; hydrolysis of  triglycerides is activated by late in phylogenesis post-heparin hepatic glycerol hydrogenase and apoC-II cofactor. The dynamic apoE is actively bound by apoB-100 forming apoE/B-100 ligand. At later stages of phylogenesis insulin formed fatty acids transferring in form of  triglycerides in lipoproteins of very low density of the same name without forming of  lipoproteins of low density; the electrophoregram of lipoproteins reﬂects absence of hepatic glycerol hydrogenase. In phylogenesis three types of fatty acids transferring to triglycerides in composition of lipoproteins formed sequentially: 1) chylomicrons + lipoproteins of very low and density + lipoproteins of low density; 2) lipoproteins of very low density + lipoproteins of low density; 3) only in lipoproteins of very low density. The frst one is specifc to piscivorous (carnivorous) while living in ocean. The second one is implemented by herbivorous while they didn't begin to synthesize insulin and hepatocytes not yet transform all endogenous palmitic fatty  into  fatty . Insulin initiated: a) transferring of  fatty acids to lipoproteins of very low density without forming  lipoproteins of low density; b) highly effective   of fatty acids in vivo: c) becoming of biological function of locomotion. The aphysiological induction by substrate, surplus of palmitic fatty acids in food initiate negative alterations in composition of lipoproteins in opposite direction than in case of phylogenesis. When homo sapiens, herbivorous in phylogenesis, begins to misuse carnivorous (meat) food then instead of normolipoproteinemia in blood plasma under electrophoresis of lipoproteins one can initially detect transitory hyperlipoproteinemia type IV and then prolonged hyperlipoproteinemia type IIb. If patient factually passes on to carnivorous diet then hyperlipoproteinemia type V is developing. If content of exogenous palmitic fatty  in food surpasses physiological capacities of its transferring in  triglycerides as palmitoyl-oleyl-palmitate glycerol, palmitic triglycerides as oleyl-palmitoyl-palmitate glycerol begin to form and epigenetically aphysiological non-ligand palmitic lipoproteins of very low density → lipoproteins of low density are formed. Their circulation in blood is a cause of hypertriglyceridemia, higher level of cholesterol-lipoproteins of low density, compensatory increasing of apoC-III. Then occurs induced by substrate formation of hyperlipoproteinemia initially of type IV, then of type IIb and fnally of type V. The pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and atheromotosis is activated when homo sapiens, herbivorous in phylogenesis, begin to misuse carnivorous food affecting biological functions of trophology, reaction of exotrophy (external nutrition), function of homeostasis, endoecology and function of adaptation. The formation of palmitic  if fatty acids instead of  one is a cause of chronic defciency of energy and ATP synthesis in vivo. Insulin activates absorption of glucose by cells with purpose to use it for synthesis of  fatty acids. In the frst place, insulin regulates in vivo  of fatty acids and only in second place  of glucose.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30738430>Trans-vaccenic  inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis of human nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells via a mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis pathway.</a></h1><p>Intake of trans fatty acids (TFAs) from partially hydrogenated vegetable oil is associated with a variety of adverse outcomes, but little is known about the health effects of ruminant trans fats. Trans-vaccenic  (TVA) is a naturally occurring TFA found in the  of ruminants and in human dairy products. The present study was conducted to investigate the anticancer activity and underlying mechanisms of TVA on human nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) 5-8F and CNE-2 cells.A CCK8 assay was used to determine the effect of TVA and the Mcl-1 inhibitor S63845 on the proliferation of NPC cells. Apoptosis was measured using flow cytometry. Western blotting was used to detect the protein expression levels of factors associated with Bcl-2-family protein signaling and Akt signaling.TVA significantly inhibited cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner. Mechanistic investigation demonstrated that TVA significantly decreased p-Akt levels and Bad phosphorylation on Ser-136 and Ser-112. More importantly, we discovered that the Mcl-1 inhibitor S63845 synergistically sensitized NPC cells to apoptosis induction by TVA.TVA can inhibit NPC cell growth and induced apoptosis through the inhibition of Bad/Akt phosphorylation. The combined use of TVA and Mcl-1 inhibitors offers a potential advantage for nasopharyngeal cancer treatment.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31083505>Protective Effects of Licochalcone A Ameliorates Obesity and Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease Via Promotion of the Sirt-1/AMPK Pathway in Mice Fed a High- Diet.</a></h1><p>Licochalcone A is a chalcone isolated from . It showed anti-tumor and anti-inflammatory properties in mice with acute lung injuries and regulated  through the activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in hepatocytes. However, the effects of licochalcone A on reducing weight gain and improving nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) are unclear. Thus, the present study investigated whether licochalcone A ameliorated weight loss and  in the liver of high- diet (HFD)-induced obese mice. Male C57BL/6 mice were fed an HFD to induce obesity and NAFLD, and then were injected intraperitoneally with licochalcone A. In another experiment, a fatty liver cell model was established by incubating HepG2 hepatocytes with  and treating the cells with licochalcone A to evaluate . Our results demonstrated that HFD-induced obese mice treated with licochalcone A had decreased body weight as well as inguinal and epididymal adipose tissue weights compared with HFD-treated mice. Licochalcone A also ameliorated hepatocyte steatosis and decreased liver tissue weight and  droplet accumulation in liver tissue. We also found that licochalcone A significantly regulated serum triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein, and free fatty acids, and decreased the fasting blood glucose value. Furthermore, in vivo and in vitro, licochalcone A significantly decreased expression of the transcription factor of lipogenesis and fatty  synthase. Licochalcone A activated the sirt-1/AMPK pathway to reduce fatty  chain synthesis and increased lipolysis and β-oxidation in hepatocytes. Licochalcone A can potentially ameliorate obesity and NAFLD in mice via activation of the sirt1/AMPK pathway.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30450126>Changes in  convey  tolerance in .</a></h1><p>The yeast  plays an essential role in the fermentation of lignocellulosic hydrolysates. Weak organic acids in lignocellulosic hydrolysate can hamper the use of this renewable resource for fuel and chemical production. Plasma-membrane remodeling has recently been found to be involved in acquiring tolerance to organic acids, but the mechanisms responsible remain largely unknown. Therefore, it is essential to understand the underlying mechanisms of  tolerance of  for developing robust industrial strains.We have performed a comparative analysis of lipids and fatty acids in  grown in the presence of four different weak acids. The general response of the yeast to  stress was found to be the accumulation of triacylglycerols and the degradation of steryl esters. In addition, a decrease in phosphatidic , phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylethanolamine, and an increase in phosphatidylinositol were observed. Loss of cardiolipin in the mitochondria membrane may be responsible for the dysfunction of mitochondria and the dramatic decrease in the rate of respiration of  under  stress. Interestingly, the accumulation of ergosterol was found to be a protective mechanism of yeast exposed to organic acids, and the  gene in ergosterol biosynthesis played a key in ergosterol-mediated  tolerance, as perturbing the expression of this gene caused rapid loss of viability. Interestingly, overexpressing  resulted in the increased levels of  (18:1n-9) and an increase in the unsaturation index of fatty acids in the plasma membrane, resulting in higher tolerance to acetic, formic and levulinic , while this change was found to be detrimental to cells exposed to lipophilic cinnamic .Comparison of  profiles revealed different remodeling of lipids, FAs and the unsaturation index of the FAs in the cell membrane in response of  to acetic, formic, levulinic and cinnamic , depending on the properties of the .

Previous studies showed that subcellular DFCP1 proteins display multi-organelle localization, including in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), Golgi apparatus and mitochondria. However, its localization and function on  droplets (LDs) remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that DFCP1 localizes to the LD upon  incubation. The ER-targeted domain of DFCP1 is indispensable for its LD localization, which is further enhanced by double FYVE domains. Inhibition of PI3P binding at the FYVE domain through wortmannin treatment or double mutation at C654S and C770S have no effect on DFCP1's LD localization. These show that the mechanisms for DFCP1 targeting the omegasome and LDs are different. DFCP1 deficiency in MEF cells causes an increase in LD number and reduces LD size.

Six healthy sedentary (maximal oxygen uptake (VO) ≤ 46 ml/kg/min) and six healthy athletic (VO > 60 ml/kg/min) young men were included. Myoblasts were cultured and differentiated to myotubes from satellite cells isolated from biopsy of musculus vastus lateralis. FA  was studied in myotubes using [C].  distribution was assessed by thin layer chromatography, and FA accumulation, lipolysis and re-esterification were measured by scintillation proximity assay. Gene and protein expressions were studied. Myotubes from athletic subjects showed lower FA accumulation, lower incorporation of FA into total lipids, triacylglycerol (TAG), diacylglycerol and cholesteryl ester, higher TAG-related lipolysis and re-esterification, and higher complete oxidation and incomplete β-oxidation of FA compared to myotubes from sedentary subjects. mRNA expression of the mitochondrial electron transport chain complex III gene UQCRB was higher in cells from athletic compared to sedentary. Myotubes established from athletic subjects have higher  turnover and oxidation compared to myotubes from sedentary subjects.

In both experiments, 6 lactating Holstein cows were assigned to 3 dietary treatments in a 3 × 3 duplicated Latin square design (21-d periods). Cows were fed a total mixed ration at a restricted level to meet their nutrient requirements. In experiment 1, 169 g dry matter (DM) of OT or 56 g DM of HP was included separately in the control diet (C1). In experiment 2, the additives were included together (OT-HP) in the control diet (C2) similar to C1. Diet C2 was compared with a control without linseed (C0). In experiment 1, the supplementation of the control diet with OT decreased urinary N excretion by 12%. In experiment 2, the combination of OT and HP decreased urinary N by 7%. Oak tannin extracts and HP alone or in combination did not influence the daily enteric CH production of cows. Cows fed diet C0 produced 17% more enteric CH daily than those fed diet C2. Intake of diet C2, which contained 6.7% extruded linseed on a DM basis (experiment 2), decreased the sum of 6:0 to 14:0 fatty acids (-16%) and palmitic  (-26%) and increased the stearic  (+50%),  (+36%), vaccenic  (trans-11 18:1; +285%), rumenic  (cis-9,trans-11 18:2; +235%), and α-linolenic  (+100%) in milk . The supplementation of diet C2 with the OT-HP mixture further improved the milk's fatty  composition. Intake of the OT alone increased α-linolenic  by 17.7% (experiment 1). The results of this study show that at the economically acceptable dose we tested, hops had no effect on urinary N excretion, CH emission, milk production, and milk composition. By contrast, supplementation of diets with oak tannin extract can be considered for reducing urinary N excretion. The combination of oak tannin and hops had no more effect than oak tannin alone except on the milk fatty  profile, which was favorably influenced from a nutritional point of view.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

Although polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) have attracted attention in the emerging field of nutritional psychiatry, their role in eating disorders remains unknown. This meta-analysis investigates the differences of PUFA levels between patients with eating disorders and healthy controls, and the potentially beneficial effects of PUFAs in such patients.We conducted a systematic literature search and meta-analysis under the random effects model.Eleven studies were included in the current meta-analysis. Compared with controls, 379 patients with eating disorders had significantly higher plasma levels of alpha-linolenic , eicosapentaenoic , stearidonic , osbond , palmitoleic , , and total omega-3 fatty acids; and lower levels of total omega-6 fatty acids and omega-6/omega-3 ratio. Eating disorders were associated with significantly higher red blood cell membrane levels of palmitoleic  and  and lower levels of adrenic , arachidonic , and total omega-6 fatty acids. In addition, PUFA supplements were associated with a benefit to body weight outcomes but not disease severity and mood symptoms in interventional trials.This meta-analysis indicates abnormal levels of PUFAs in peripheral blood tissues in patients with eating disorders. The relationship between PUFAs and eating disorders should be interpreted cautiously considering the specific  under starvation state. To investigate the role of PUFAs on psychopathological and therapeutic effects in eating disorders, further larger clinical studies are warranted.Copyright © 2019.

The pathogenesis of the disease includes an increased concentration of FFA in blood, an increase in the biosynthesis of fatty acids, and disorders in the process of -oxidation.The aim of the study was to analyze the fatty acids in erythrocyte membranes among 55 patients with NAFLD who were subjected to a 6-month dietary intervention in order to reduce fatty liver.Basic anthropometric and biochemical measurements were performed. The profile of fatty acids was measured in the membranes of erythrocytes and analyzed by gas chromatography. The dietary compliance was evaluated using 72-diary questionnaires, anthropometric measurements.With the reduction of fatty liver (p<0.01), the patients' biochemical and anthropometric parameters were significantly improved. A significant decrease in the concentration of alanine aminotransferase (p<0.01) and asparagine aminotransferase (p<0.01) was observed, along with a decrease in the amount of insulin (p<0.05) and insulin resistance (p<0.05). Significant changes in terms of the fatty  profile were observed among patients who followed the dietary intervention. There was a noticeable tendency in terms of the reduction palmitic  (p<0.055) and a significant reduction of stearic  (p<0.05). Significant changes in the profile of fatty acids were also associated with the reductionof palmitoleic (p<0.05) and  acids (p<0.05).

The ChDiPiCa showed excellent in vitro biocidal activity against MRSA at 26 μg/mL compared to the antibiotic streptomycin and bacitracin 14 μg/mL and 13 μg/mL at 10 μg concentration respectively. The membrane damaging property was confirmed by the SEM analysis. Further, we addressed the new approach for the first time to overcome antibiotic resistance of MRSA through membrane microdomain miss loading to lipids. By which, the ChDiPiCa confirms the significant activity in miss loading of FMM of MRSA which is validated by the fatty  profile and  analysis. The result shows that, altered saturated (Lauric  and Myristic ), mono unsaturated (), and poly unsaturated (Linoleic  and Linolenic ) fatty acids and hypothesises, altered the membrane functional lipids. For the better understanding of miss loading of FMM by the ChDiPiCa, the in-silico molecular docking studies was analyzed and confirmed the predicted role.

This study aimed at introducing advanced techniques to characterize nanostructured  carriers (NLC) comprising palmitic , , stabilizer and Domperidone. Crystallinity of single components and mixtures was investigated by laboratory Small Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS). NLC were studied with laboratory Small and Wide Angle X-ray Scattering (SWAXS). Photon Correlation Spectroscopy and Freeze Fracture Transmission Electron Microscopy were used to monitor particle size, zeta potential and shape. Stability of NLC was investigated using synchrotron X-ray Diffraction (XRD) and SAXS and laboratory SAXS. Palmitic  showed a lamellar structure (polymorph C), which was still present after particle preparation. Spherical 300 nm-sized particles with zeta potential values above -30 mV were obtained and Domperidone was incorporated in its amorphous form. During storage, no differences in synchrotron XRD spectra were seen. However, laboratory SAXS measurements showed a second lamellar structure, identified as polymorph B. Synchrotron SAXS temperature scans confirmed that polymorph B did not affect the morphology of the encapsulated drug or the shape of NLC.

Chaperon-mediated autophagy (CMA) triggers  droplets (LDs) breakdown, to initiate lipolysis via either cytosolic lipases or macroautophagy. SIRT3, a mitochondrial NAD-dependent deacetylase, regulates the acetylation status and activity of many substrates involving in energy . However, the role of SIRT3 in regulating lipophagy is controversial. The current study showed that SIRT3 expression was decreased and the macroautophagy flux was blocked in the primary hepatocytes from high- diet fed mice and P/O (palmitic  and  mixture) treated AML12 mouse hepatocytes, compared with the corresponding controls. SIRT3 overexpression promoted macroautophagy in LDs from P/O-treated hepatocytes through activating AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and unc-51-like kinase 1, to boost LDs digestion. Gain of SIRT3 expression stimulated the formation of lysosome-associated membrane protein 2A (LAMP-2A)-heat shock cognate 71 kDa protein (HSC70)-perilipin-2 (PLN2) complex, to promote CMA process and reduce the stability of LDs in hepatocytes. Moreover, SIRT3 reduced the expression of stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1, to suppress lipogenesis. In addition, SIRT3 overexpression promoted LDs dispersion on detyrosinated microtubules, and directly deacetylated long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase to enhance mitochondrial energetics. Taken together, SIRT3 ameliorates lipotoxicity in hepatocytes, which might be a potential target for the treatment of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30866181>Single Cell Oil Production from Undetoxified  L. hydrolysate by .</a></h1><p>The use of low-cost substrates represents one key issue to make single cell oil production sustainable. Among low-input crops, . is a perennial herbaceous rhizomatous grass containing both C5 and C6 carbohydrates. The scope of the present work was to investigate and optimize the production of lipids by the oleaginous yeast  from undetoxified lignocellulosic hydrolysates of steam-pretreated . The growth of  was first optimized in synthetic media, similar in terms of sugar concentration to hydrolysates, by applying the response surface methodology (RSM) analysis. Then the bioconversion of undetoxified hydrolysates was investigated. A fed-batch process for the fermentation of  hydrolysates was finally implemented in a 2-L bioreactor. Under optimized conditions, the total  content was 64% of the dry cell weight and the  yield was 63% of the theoretical. The fatty  profile of  triglycerides contained 27% palmitic , 33%  and 32% linoleic . These results proved the potential of  production from A. donax, which is particularly important for their consideration as substitutes for vegetable oils in many applications such as biodiesel or bioplastics.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30527540>Lipidomic Analysis of α-Synuclein Neurotoxicity Identifies Stearoyl CoA Desaturase as a Target for Parkinson Treatment.</a></h1><p>In Parkinson's disease (PD), α-synuclein (αS) pathologically impacts the brain, a highly -rich organ. We investigated how alterations in αS or /fatty  homeostasis affect each other. Lipidomic profiling of human αS-expressing yeast revealed increases in  (OA, 18:1), diglycerides, and triglycerides. These findings were recapitulated in rodent and human neuronal models of αS dyshomeostasis (overexpression; patient-derived triplication or E46K mutation; E46K mice). Preventing  droplet formation or augmenting OA increased αS yeast toxicity; suppressing the OA-generating enzyme stearoyl-CoA-desaturase (SCD) was protective. Genetic or pharmacological SCD inhibition ameliorated toxicity in αS-overexpressing rat neurons. In a C. elegans model, SCD knockout prevented αS-induced dopaminergic degeneration. Conversely, we observed detrimental effects of OA on αS homeostasis: in human neural cells, excess OA caused αS inclusion formation, which was reversed by SCD inhibition. Thus, monounsaturated fatty   is pivotal for αS-induced neurotoxicity, and inhibiting SCD represents a novel PD therapeutic approach.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

The present study investigated the ameliorative effects of EMO on high- diet-induced non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and explored relative regulation mechanism. The analysis of EMO fatty acids showed that EMO rich in unsaturated fatty acids (92.07%), such as linoleic  (48.24%),  (34.20%) and linolenic  (7.57%). In addition, supplementation of EMO could ameliorate the increase in body weight,  weight, and abnormal serum lipids induced by high- diet. A further important implication is that the levels of serum ALT, serum AST, hepatic TG, TC, SOD, GSH/GSSG ration and MDA were improved after supplementing with EMO. All these changes may be due to the ability of EMO to inhibit fatty  synthesis via reducing the mRNA expression of SREBP-1c, PPARγ and FAS, and elevate fatty  oxidation by increasing the mRNA expression of PPARα and CPT-1. Meanwhile, our results also showed that endogenously synthesized n-3 PUFAs could significantly increase after treating with EMO. In conclusion, the results suggested that EMO could be regarded as a healthy food for preventing NAFLD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30418001>Production of Healthy Functional Soft White Cheese Using <i>Moringa oleifera </i>Oil.</a></h1><p>Moringa oleifera oil is composed of highly unsaturated fatty acids containing 80.4% polyunsaturated, mainly  acids 67.9% and had a low  value and low free fatty acids composition, so it is acceptable for edible application.

However, no studies to date have examined the use of high- (HO) peanut cultivars as a feed ingredient for laying hens and determined the impact of feeding HO peanuts on performance and egg nutritive qualities. This project aimed to examine the use of HO peanuts as a feed ingredient for layer hens to determine the effect on performance, egg  chemistry, and quality of the eggs produced. Forty-eight 40-wk-old layer hens were fed a conventional soybean meal + corn control diet or a HO peanut + corn diet for 10 wk in conventional battery cages. Body and feed weights were collected weekly. Pooled egg samples were analyzed for quality,  analysis, and peanut protein allergenicity. There were no significant differences in hen performance or egg quality as measured by USDA grade quality, egg albumen height, or egg Haugh unit between the treatment groups. However, eggs produced from layer hens fed the HO peanut + corn diet had reduced egg weights relative to the controls (P = 0.0001). Eggs produced from layer hens fed the HO peanut diet had greater yolk color scores (P < 0.0001), HO fatty  (P < 0.0001), and β-carotene (P < 0.0001) levels in comparison to the controls. Eggs produced from hens fed the control diet had greater palmitic and stearic saturated fatty acids (P < 0.0001), and trans  (P < 0.0001) content compared to eggs produced from hens fed the HO peanut diet. All egg protein extracts from all treatments at each time point were non-reactive with rabbit anti-peanut agglutinin antibodies. This study identifies HO peanuts as an abundant commodity that could be used to support local agricultural markets of peanuts and poultry within the southeastern United States and be of economic advantage to producers while providing a potential health benefit to the consumer with improved egg nutrition.Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Poultry Science Association 2018.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31373507>Alcohol-induced microtubule acetylation leads to the accumulation of large, immobile  droplets.</a></h1><p>Although steatosis (fatty liver) is a clinically well-described early stage of alcoholic liver disease, surprisingly little is known about how it promotes hepatotoxicity. We have shown that ethanol consumption leads to microtubule hyperacetylation that can explain ethanol-induced defects in protein trafficking. Because almost all steps of the  droplet life cycle are microtubule dependent and because microtubule acetylation promotes adipogenesis, we examined droplet dynamics in ethanol-treated cells. In WIF-B cells treated with ethanol and/or  (a fatty  associated with the "Western" diet), we found that ethanol dramatically increased  droplet numbers and led to the formation of large, peripherally located droplets. Enhanced droplet formation required alcohol dehydrogenase-mediated ethanol , and peripheral droplet distributions required intact microtubules. We also determined that ethanol-induced microtubule acetylation led to impaired droplet degradation. Live-cell imaging revealed that droplet motility was microtubule dependent and that droplets were virtually stationary in ethanol-treated cells. To determine more directly whether microtubule hyperacetylation could explain impaired droplet motility, we overexpressed the tubulin-specific acetyltransferase αTAT1 to promote microtubule acetylation in the absence of alcohol. Droplet motility was impaired in αTAT1-expressing cells but to a lesser extent than in ethanol-treated cells. However, in both cases, the large immotile droplets (but not small motile ones) colocalized with dynein and dynactin (but not kinesin), implying that altered droplet-motor microtubule interactions may explain altered dynamics. These studies further suggest that modulating cellular acetylation is a potential strategy for treating alcoholic liver disease. Chronic alcohol consumption with the "Western diet" enhances the development of fatty liver and leads to impaired droplet motility, which may have serious deletrious effects on hepatocyte function.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30316698>Delta-9 fatty  desaturase overexpression enhanced  production and  content in Rhodosporidium toruloides for preferable yeast  production.</a></h1><p>The oil plants provide a sufficient source of renewable  production for alternative fuel and chemical supplies as an alternative to the depleting fossil source, but the environmental effect from these plants' cropping is a concern. The high  (OA; C18:1) content in plant-derived products provide advantages of multiple uses with improved oxidative stability and a wide range of applicable temperature. Here we used a promising  producer, the oleaginous yeast Rhodosporidium toruloides, to attempt to obtain an OA-enriched . Saccharomyces cerevisiae OLE1 (ScOLE1) gene encodes Δ9 fatty  desaturase (Δ9FAD), which is generally known to synthesize palmitoleic  (POA; C16:1) and OA, but the functions of putative R. toruloides Δ9FAD gene are not well understood. In a complementary test, the RtΔ9FAD gene rescued the survival of an OA-deficient Scole1Δ mutant, and we introduced the RtΔ9FAD gene into R. toruloides strains for the production of OA-enriched . Increasing  production was observed in ScOLE1 and genomic RtΔ9FAD gene-overexpressing R. toruloides strains.

Actually, inadequate dietary habits together with physical inactivity are primary determinants of obesity and cancer risk. Changes in  play a crucial role in different types of cancer and key enzymes involved in -metabolic pathways, such as stearoyl-coA-desaturase 1 (SCD-1), are differentially expressed in normal and cancer tissues.Food frequency questionnaires (FFQ) were analyzed by Winfood software. FA were assessed by gas-liquid chromatography in visceral AT samples. Estimated desaturase activities were calculated as precursor FA/product FA ratio. Desaturase gene expressions were evaluated by RT-qPCR.Lean and obese CRC subjects showed inadequate dietary habits. In particular, lean CRC subjects showed increase in the intake of saturated FA, specifically palmitic (p = 0.0042) and stearic  (p = 0.0091), and a corresponding reduction of monounsaturated FA consumption, in particular  (p = 0.002) with respect to lean without CRC. Estimated SCD-1 activity in AT was increased in all the groups vs lean without CRC (pANOVA = 0.029).Unhealthy eating habits, characterizing obese and CRC subjects, may influence the visceral AT profile and contribute to the alteration of the metabolic pathways. The quality of the diet, other than the quantity, can have a main role in the establishment of inflammatory microenvironment and in metabolic changes favouring CRC.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30692541>Nuclear  droplets derive from a lipoprotein precursor and regulate phosphatidylcholine synthesis.</a></h1><p>The origin and physiological significance of  droplets (LDs) in the nucleus is not clear. Here we show that nuclear LDs in hepatocytes are derived from apolipoprotein B (ApoB)-free lumenal LDs, a precursor to very low-density lipoproprotein (VLDL) generated in the ER lumen by microsomal triglyceride transfer protein. ApoB-free lumenal LDs accumulate under ER stress, grow within the lumen of the type I nucleoplasmic reticulum, and turn into nucleoplasmic LDs by disintegration of the surrounding inner nuclear membrane.  with or without tunicamycin significantly increases the formation of nucleoplasmic LDs, to which CDP-choline diacylglycerol phosphotransferase α (CCTα) is recruited, resulting in activation of phosphatidylcholine (PC) synthesis. Perilipin-3 competes with CCTα in binding to nucleoplasmic LDs, and thus, knockdown and overexpression of perilipin-3 increases and decreases PC synthesis, respectively. The results indicate that nucleoplasmic LDs in hepatocytes constitute a feedback mechanism to regulate PC synthesis in accordance with ER stress.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30673191>[Biological role of insulin: transformation of carnivores leaving in the ocean into herbivores living on the dry land. Development of the biological function of locomotion and kinetic parameters of the body.]</a></h1><p>Phylogenetic theory of general pathology draws researchers' attention to the following aspects of the biological effects of insulin. 1. Phylogenetically, in vivo insulin is primarily involved in the  of fatty acids (FA) and only in the second turn in glucose ; regulation of FA  in cells started millions of years earlier than that of glucose . Phylogenetically late insulin blocks lipolysis only in phylogenetically late insulin-dependent subcutaneous adipocytes but not in phylogenetically early visceral  cells of the omentum. 2. Biological role of insulin consists in the formation of the biological function of locomotion, i.e., movement arising from contraction of striated myocytes provided with substrates (FA and glucose) for energy production as macroergic ATP. 3. Biological destiny of phylogenetically late insulin is transformation of carnivorous (fish-eating) animals living in the ocean into herbivores living on the dry land. 4. Insulin has formed in vivo highly efficient  variant of FA  instead of phylogenetically early less efficient palmitic variant. 5. Biologically, insulin is destined for providing cells with energy and perfection of physical activity and kinetic parameters of the organism. According to phylogenetic theory of general pathology and basic principles of endocrinology, clinical cases should be regarded as: 1. rare structurally-related insulindeficient type I diabetes mellitus, 2. rare structurally-related (receptor pathology) hyperinsulinemic type II diabetes mellitus, and 3. a great number of patients with functional disorders in the hormone activity, insulin resistance syndrome, metabolic syndrome and obesity.

Herein, we explored effects of melatonin on  accumulation induced by  in HepG2 cells and characterized the underlying molecular mechanisms. Pretreatment with melatonin (0.1-0.3 mM) significantly inhibited accumulation of triglyceride and cholesterol induced by incubating HepG2 cells with high concentrations of  ( overload) (p < 0.05). Melatonin pretreatment induced phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), causing their activation and inactivation, respectively. Expression levels of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-α (PPARα) and its target gene carnitine palmitoyl-CoA transferase 1 (CPT1), which are associated with lipolysis, were upregulated by melatonin, whereas expression of sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c), fatty  synthase (FAS), and stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD1), which are associated with lipogenesis, were downregulated. Melatonin did not change expression of genes involved in cholesterol , including 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase (HMGR) and SREBP-2. Melatonin inhibits  accumulation induced by  overload in HepG2 cells. The phosphorylation and activation of AMPK may have important roles in inactivating  anabolic pathways and activating triglyceride catabolic pathways.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30554540>Plasma unbound free fatty  profiles in premature infants before and after intralipid infusion.</a></h1><p>Unbound free fatty acids (FFAu) are the bioactive fraction of plasma free fatty acids (FFA). Most plasma FFA are bound to albumin. Only when FFA dissociate from albumin, do they become biologically active.To measure the first FFAu profiles in human infants and to measure these profiles before and during intravenous administration of the soybean , intralipid (IL).The study population was 16 premature infants, from a parent study of 130 infants with birth weights 500-2000 g and gestational age 23-34 weeks. The infants chosen had plasma samples of ≥120 µL (volume needed for each FFAu profile measurement) in the first day of life. Infants received IL infusions starting in the second day of life at 1 g/kg/day, increasing by 1-g/kg/day daily up to 3 g/kg/day. FFAu profiles were determined during IL infusion when plasma was available. Profiles are the concentrations of the nine most abundant long-chain FFAu and were determined using novel fluorescent probes.Before intralipid infusion unbound myristic  was the dominant FFAu, as high as 78% of the total FFAu (sum of the 9 FFAu). In contrast, unbound linoleic  was 0% in all infants. With increasing infusion of IL to 3 g/kg/day, unbound linoleic increased to 26% of the total FFAu, with unbound , myristic, and linolenic  the second, third and fourth most abundant. The average total FFAu concentration also increased from 4 nM before intralipid to 53 nM at 3 g/kg/day. During IL infusion the FFAu profiles approached the fatty  composition of intralipid at 3 g/kg/day.This first study of FFAu profiles in neonates revealed that before IL infusion unbound linoleic  was zero in all 16 infants and levels of myristic  were exceptionally large, as much as 78% of the total FFAu profile. These results suggest important and previously unrecognized roles of  in early development. Zero unbound linoleic  before IL infusion may help promote closure of the ductus arteriosus but after IL infusion, synthesis of arachidonic from linoleic  may tend to promote patency. The high levels of unbound myristate may be needed for immediate neonatal energy needs.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30948912>Ursodeoxycholic  ameliorates hepatic  in LO2 cells by regulating the AKT/mTOR/SREBP-1 signaling pathway.</a></h1><p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), the most common chronic liver disease, can progress into nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), cirrhosis, and even hepatocellular carcinoma. Bile acids such as ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) play an essential role in the pathogenesis of NAFLD by regulating the level of sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) 1c, but the underlying regulatory mechanism remains elusive. Increased evidence indicates that the AKT/mTOR/SREBP-1 signaling pathway is a key pathway to regulate hepatic cellular . UDCA may regulate the AKT/mTOR/SREBP-1 signaling pathway to ameliorate hepatic .To investigate the functional mechanism of UDCA in an  (OA)-induced cellular model of NAFLD.The cellular model of NAFLD was established using OA and treated with UDCA. First, the best concentration of UDCA was selected. For the best time-dependent assay, cells were stimulated with OA only or co-treated with OA and 2 mmol/L UDCA for 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h. Oil red O staining was used to observe the accumulation of intracellular lipids, while the intracellular contents of triglyceride, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were detected by enzymatic methods. Meanwhile, the expression levels of AKT/mTOR/SREBP-1 signaling pathway-related proteins were detected by real-time PCR and Western blot.In the NAFLD cell model established with LO2 cells induced using OA,  accumulation was obvious. UDCA significantly inhibited  accumulation at different concentrations (especially 2 mmol/L) and decreased cell growth ability at different time points. The biochemical parameters like ALT, AST, and GGT were significant improved by UDCA. UDCA treatment vividly repressed the activation of AKT, mTOR, and CRTC2 and the expression of nSREBP-1 in LO2 cells induced with OA.Our findings demonstrate the effect of UDCA in improving NAFLD. UDCA attenuates OA-induced hepatic steatosis mainly by regulation of AKT/mTOR/SREBP-1 signal transduction.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31037529>Metabonomic analysis of the hepatic injury suffer from hexavalent chromium poisoning in broilers.</a></h1><p>Chromium is used in daily life and has a wide range of functions. It plays an important role in protein synthesis and carbohydrate and . Chromium is found in trivalent Cr(III) and hexavalent Cr(VI) form; Cr(III) is relatively stable and intimately participates with many phenomena of metabolisms. Whereas, Cr(VI) is toxic, which results in growth inhibition and leading to changes in components of antioxidant systems as well as secondary metabolites. However, the molecular mechanism that is involved in Cr (VI)-induced hepatotoxicity is still unclear. For this purpose, 40 chickens were randomly assigned into two groups: the normal group (feeding the basic diet and clear water), the chromium group (16%LD, 74.24 mg/kg/day KCrO ). The samples were subjected to pathological examination and UHPLC-QE-MS non-target metabolomics method for metabolomics analysis of broiler liver using principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA). The central venous cells of the broiler liver in the chromium poisoning group showed turbidity and flaky necrosis, nuclear condensation, nuclear rupture, and even nuclear dissolution. The differential metabolite analysis between the chromium poisoning and the control group showed that 32 differential metabolites were upregulated and 15 were downregulated in positive ion mode. Whereas,17 differential metabolites were downregulated, and 35 were downregulated in negative ion mode (P ≤ 0.05). The potential marker substances are  acidamide, farnesylacetone, betaine, taurine, choline, and galactinol. Additionally, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways showed that the , carbohydrate , nucleotide , amino  , energy , membrane transport, digestive system, and nervous system were the most important metabolic pathways in the liver. This study provides a theoretical basis for the future understanding of the pathogenesis of chromium poisoning and a new insight of the subsequent molecular mechanism of chromium hepatotoxicity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30753863>Acetaminophen aggravates  accumulation in NAFLD by inhibiting autophagy via the AMPK/mTOR pathway.</a></h1><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common chronic liver disease which affects millions of people worldwide. Acetaminophen (APAP) overdose is the leading cause of acute liver failure. In this study, APAP (50, 100, 200 mg/kg) were employed on mice fed with a high- diet, and APAP (2, 4, 8 mM) were cultured with L02 cells in the presence of alcohol and . APAP treatment significantly aggravated hepatic  accumulation, increased the serum levels of triglyceride (TG), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and increased hepatic  accumulation in H&E and Oil red O staining results. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) found fewer number of autophagosomes in APAP (100 mg/kg) treated group. Immunohistochemistry analysis showed the intensity of hepatic mTOR was increased and AMPK was decreased in 200 mg/kg APAP treated group. Western blot analysis showed APAP treatment decreased the levels of LC3-Ⅱ, Beclin1 and AMPK, while increased the levels of mTOR and SREBP-1c, respectively. In vitro study showed APAP treatment obviously increased TG activities in cell supernatant, and Oil red O staining had the same results. Western blot analysis demonstrated APAP treatment decreased the levels of LC3-Ⅱ, Beclin1 and AMPK, increased the levels of mTOR and SREBP-1c, but rapamycin treatment significantly reversed these effects of APAP. In conclusion, therapeutic dosages of APAP aggravates  accumulation in NAFLD, the potential mechanism might be involved in inhibiting autophagy associated with the AMPK/mTOR pathway, and patients with NAFLD should use a lower dose of APAP.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

To determine whether any shifts in fuel use were due solely to increases in energy expenditure, we also studied a condition consisting of a single isoenergetic 45-min bout of moderate-intensity exercise (ONE). Twenty sedentary overweight or obese adults (10 men/10 women; 32.4 ± 6.3 yr; BMI, 30.6 ± 2.9 kg/m) completed all three conditions (MICRO, SED, and ONE) in a randomized order. Each condition consisted of a 3-day free-living run-in followed by a 24-h stay in a whole-room calorimeter to measure total energy expenditure (TEE) and substrate utilization. Dietary  oxidation was also assessed during the chamber stay by administering a [1-C]  tracer at breakfast. Energy intake was matched across conditions. Both MICRO and ONE increased TEE relative to SED, resulting in a negative energy balance. HOMA-IR improved in both activity conditions. MICRO increased 24-h carbohydrate oxidation compared with both ONE and SED ( P < 0.01 for both). ONE was associated with higher 24-h total  oxidation compared with SED, and higher 24-h dietary  oxidation compared with both SED and MICRO. Differences in substrate oxidation remained significant after adjusting for energy balance. In overweight and obese men and women, breaking up sitting time increased reliance upon carbohydrate as fuel over 24 h, while a single energy-matched continuous bout of exercise preferentially relies upon  over 24 h. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Insulin sensitivity, as assessed by HOMA-IR, was improved after 4 days of physical activity, independent of frequency and duration of activity bouts. Temporal patterns of activity across the day differentially affect substrate oxidation. Frequent interruptions of sedentary time with short bouts of walking primarily increase 24-h carbohydrate oxidation, whereas an energy-matched single continuous bout of moderate intensity walking primarily increased 24-h  oxidation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31276903>Effects of algae supplementation in high-energy dietary on fatty  composition and the expression of genes involved in  in Hu sheep managed under intensive finishing system.</a></h1><p>This study aims to investigate the effect of algae supplementation in high-energy diet (HE diet) on  of intensive feeding sheep. The lambs were assigned to two groups and received a standard diet (ST diet, 8.40 MJ/kg) or a HE diet (9.70 MJ/kg) based on corn, wheat bran, soybean meal. Each group was divided into two subgroups: control and algae supplement (3%, DM basis). The body , serum cholesterol, and  in the liver and muscle increased in lambs receiving the HE diet. However, after supplementing the microalgae (Schizochytrium sp.) in the HE diet, these parameters were all reduced. In addition, EPA, DHA and CLA cis-9, trans-11 in muscle and liver increased. Algae supplementation also altered the expression of -related genes, including up-regulated FADS2, ELOVL2, SCD, CPT1α and SREBF-1, and down-regulated PPARα and PPARγ. In conclusion, algae supplementation in ST and HE diets increased n-3PUFA and improved metabolic disorder caused by the HE diet.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Coconut oil and its derivatives have been widely used in various industries. In this paper, a type 2 diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT2), which is one of the key enzymes involved in triacylglycerol (TAG) biosynthesis, was first characterized in coconut pulp (endosperm). The results indicated that CoDGAT2 was highly expressed in coconut pulp approximately 7 months after pollination. The heterologous expression of CoDGAT2 in the mutant yeast H1246 restored TAG biosynthesis in the yeast, which exhibited substrate preference for two unsaturated fatty acids (UFAs), palmitoleic  (C16:1) and  (C18:1). Moreover, the seed-specific overexpression of CoDGAT2 in Arabidopsis thaliana led to a significant increase in the linoleic  (C18:2) content (approximately 6%) compared with that in the wild type. In contrast, the proportions of eicosadienoic  (C20:1) and arachidic  (C20:0) were decreased. These results offer new insights on the function of CoDGAT2 in coconut and provide a novel molecular target for  genetic modification to change the fatty  (FA) composition of oils.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Lack of non-invasive diagnostic tools and effective therapies constitute two of the major hurdles for a bona fide treatment and a reversal of NASH progression and/or regression of the disease. Nitro- (OA-NO) has been proven effective in multiple experimental models of inflammation and fibrosis. Thus, the potential benefit of in vivo administration of OA-NO to treat advanced NAFLD was tested herein in a model of long-term NASH diet-induced liver damage.Non-invasive imaging (e.g. photoacustic-ultrasound (PA-US)) was pursued to establish advanced experimental model of NASH in mice in which both steatosis and fibrosis were diagnosed prior experimental therapy with OA-NO. Experimental controls included equimolar amounts of the non-nitrated  (OA). CLAMS and NMR-based analysis was used for energy .CLAMS and NMR-based analysis demonstrates that OA-NO improves body composition and energy  and inhibits hepatic triglyceride (TG) accumulation. Photoacoustic-ultrasound imaging revealed a robust inhibition of liver steatosis and fibrosis by OA-NO. RNA-sequencing analysis uncovered inflammation and fibrosis as major pathways suppressed by OA-NO administration, as well as regulation of lipogenesis and lipolysis pathways, with a robust inhibition of SREBP1 proteolytic activation and subsequent lipogenesis gene expression by OA-NO. These results were further supported by histological analysis and quantification of  accumulation, lobular inflammation (F4/80 staining) and fibrosis (collagen deposition, αSMA staining) as well as established parameters of liver damage (ALT). In vitro studies indicate that OA-NO inhibits TG biosynthesis and accumulation in hepatocytes and inhibits fibrogenesis in human stellate cells.OA-NO improve steatohepatitis and fibrosis and may constitute an effective therapeutic approach against advanced NAFLD that warrants further clinical evaluation.Copyright © 2019.

Conjugated fatty acids (CFA), namely isomers of linoleic and linolenic  (i.e. CLA and CLNA, respectively) can positively modulate inflammation processes and energy , promoting anti-carcinogenic and antioxidant effects, improved  profiles and insulin resistance, among others. Bioactive doses have been indicated to be above 1 g/d, yet these cannot be achieved through a moderate intake (i.e. 1-2 servings) of natural sources, and certain CLA-containing products have limited commercial availability. Such handicaps have fueled research interest in finding alternative fortification strategies. In recent years, screening of dairy products for CFA-producing bacteria has attracted much attention and has led to the identification of some promising strains, including Bifidobacterium breve NCIMB 702258. This strain has shown interesting producing capabilities in model systems as well as positive modulation of  activities in animal studies. Accordingly, the aim of this research work was to assay B. breve NCIMB 702258 in semi-skimmed milk to produce a probiotic fermented dairy product enriched in bioactive CLA and CLNA. The effect of substrates (LA, α-LNA and γ-LNA) on growth performance and membrane fatty acids profile was also studied, as these potential modifications have been associated to stress response. When tested in cys-MRS culture medium, LA, α-LNA and γ-LNA impaired the fatty  synthesis by B. breve since membrane concentrations for stearic and  acids decreased. Variations in the C18:1 c11 and lactobacillic  concentrations, may suggest that these substrates are also affecting the membrane fluidity. Bifidobacterium breve CFA production capacity was first assessed in cys-MRS with LA, α-LNA, γ-LNA or all substrates together at 0.5 mg/mL each. This strain did not produce CFA from γ-LNA, but converted 31.12% of LA and 68.20% of α-LNA into CLA and CLNA, respectively, after incubation for 24 h at 37 °C. In a second phase, B. breve was inoculated in a commercial semi-skimmed milk with LA, α-LNA or both at 0.5 mg/mL each. Bifidobacterium breve revealed a limited capacity to synthesize CLA isomers, but was able to produce 0.062-0.115 mg/mL CLNA after 24 h at 37 °C. However, organoleptic problems were reported which need to be addressed in future studies. These results show that although CFA were produced at too low concentrations to be able to achieve solely the bioactive dose in one daily portion size, fermented dairy products are a suitable vector to deliver B. breve NCIMB 702258.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31178837>Transcriptional Comparison Investigating the Influence of the Addition of Unsaturated Fatty Acids on Aroma Compounds During Alcoholic Fermentation.</a></h1><p>The levels of unsaturated fatty acids (UFAs) in grape must significantly influence yeast  and the production of aroma compounds. In this work, cDNA microarray technology was applied to analyze the transcriptional discrepancies of wine yeast (commercial wine yeast Lalvin EC1118) fermenting in synthetic grape must supplemented with different concentrations of a mixture of UFAs (including linoleic , , and α-linolenic ). The results showed that the initial addition of a high level of UFAs can significantly enrich the intracellular UFAs when compared to a low addition of UFAs and further increase the cell population and most volatiles, including higher alcohols and esters, except for several fatty acids. Microarray analyses identified that 63 genes were upregulated, and 91 genes were downregulated during the different fermentation stages. The up-regulated genes were involved in yeast growth and proliferation, stress responses and amino  transportation, while the repressed genes were associated with  and sterol biosynthesis, amino  , TCA cycle regulation, mitochondrial respiration, and stress responses. Unexpectedly, the genes directly related to the biosynthesis of volatile compounds did not vary substantially between the fermentations with the high and low UFA additions. The beneficial aromatic function of the UFAs was ascribed to the increased biomass and amino  transportation, considering that the incorporation of the additional UFAs in yeast cells maintains high membrane fluidity and increases the ability of the cells to resist deleterious conditions. Our results highlighted the importance of UFAs in the regulation of aroma biosynthesis during wine fermentation and suggested that the improvement of the resistance of yeast to extreme stresses during alcoholic fermentation is essential to effectively modulate and improve the production of aroma compounds. A potential way to achieve this goal could be the rational increase of the UFA contents in grape must.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30429218>Acyl-chain selectivity and physiological roles of  fatty -binding proteins.</a></h1><p>Fatty  (FA) kinase produces acyl-phosphate for the synthesis of membrane phospholipids in Gram-positive bacterial pathogens. FA kinase consists of a kinase protein (FakA) that phosphorylates an FA substrate bound to a second module, an FA-binding protein (FakB).  expresses two distinct, but related, FakBs with different FA selectivities. Here, we report the structures of FakB1 bound to four saturated FAs at 1.6-1.93 Å resolution. We observed that the different FA structures are accommodated within a slightly curved hydrophobic cavity whose length is governed by the conformation of an isoleucine side chain at the end of the tunnel. The hydrophobic tunnel in FakB1 prevents the binding of -unsaturated FAs, which are instead accommodated by the kinked tunnel within the FakB2 protein. The differences in the FakB interiors are not propagated to the proteins' surfaces, preserving the protein-protein interactions with their three common partners, FakA, PlsX, and PlsY. Using cellular thermal shift analyses, we found that FakB1 binds FA , whereas a significant proportion of FakB2 does not. Incorporation of exogenous FA into phospholipid in Δ and Δ knockout strains revealed that FakB1 does not efficiently activate unsaturated FAs. FakB2 preferred unsaturated FAs, but also allowed the incorporation of saturated FAs. These results are consistent with a model in which FakB1 primarily functions in the recycling of the saturated FAs produced by  , whereas FakB2 activates host-derived oleate, which  does not produce but is abundant at infection sites.© 2019 Cuypers et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30977920>Untargeted Metabolite Profiling of Adipose Tissue in Hyperlipidemia Rats Exposed to Hawthorn Ethanol Extracts.</a></h1><p>The study aimed to explore the metabolic changes of adipose tissue of hyperlipidemia rats with hawthorn ethanol extracts (HEE) consumption by a high-throughput metabolomics approach. HEE were mainly composed of chlorogenic , hyperoside, isoquercitrin, rutin, vitexin, quercetin, and apigenin by HPLC analysis. HEE administration significantly lowered levels of the total cholesterols, triglyceride and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol as compared to the high- diet model. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry was used to identify adipose metabolite profiles. Numerous endogenous molecules were altered by high- diet and restored following intervention of HEE. Metabolites elevated in adipose, including l-threonine, aspartic , glutamine, mannose, inositol and , were detected after HEE consumption. Fifteen metabolites were identified as potential biomarkers of hyperlipidemia. Pathway analysis showed that most of the discriminant metabolites were included in fatty  biosynthesis, galactose , biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids, arginine and proline , alanine, aspartate and glutamate , glycerolipid  and steroid biosynthesis. These metabolites and metabolic networks we found offer new insights into exploring the molecular mechanisms of -lowering of hawthorn ethanol extracts on adipose tissue of rats. PRACTICAL APPLICATION: There was a very high proportion of hyperlipidemia in China. Hawthorn is attracting increasing attention owing to their health benefits, low toxicity, effectiveness and might be suitable for long-term use.© 2019 Institute of Food Technologists®.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30993495>Saturated fatty  stimulates production of extracellular vesicles by renal tubular epithelial cells.</a></h1><p>Lipotoxicity, an accumulation of intracellular  metabolites, has been proposed as an important pathogenic mechanism contributing to kidney dysfunction in the context of metabolic disease. Palmitic , a predominant  derivative, can cause lipoapoptosis and the release of inflammatory extracellular vesicles (EVs) in hepatocytes, but the effect of lipids on EV production in chronic kidney disease remains vaguely explored. This study was aimed to investigate whether palmitic  would stimulate EV release from renal proximal tubular epithelial cells. Human and rat proximal tubular epithelial cells, HK-2 and NRK-52E, were incubated with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA), BSA-conjugated palmitic  (PA), and BSA-conjugated  (OA) for 24-48 h. The EVs released into conditioned media were isolated by ultracentrifugation and quantified by nanoparticle-tracking analysis (NTA). According to NTA, the size distribution of EVs was 30-150 nm with similar mode sizes in all experimental groups. Moreover, BSA-induced EV release was significantly enhanced in the presence of PA, whereas EV release was not altered by the addition of OA. In NRK-52E cells, PA-enhanced EV release was associated with an induction of cell apoptosis reflected by an increase in cleaved caspase-3 protein by Western blot and Annexin V positive cells analyzed by flow cytometry. Additionally, confocal microscopy confirmed the uptake of -induced EVs by recipient renal proximal tubular cells. Collectively, our results indicate that PA stimulates EV release from cultured proximal tubular epithelial cells. Thus, extended characterization of -induced EVs may constitute new signaling paradigms contributing to chronic kidney disease pathology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30348899>Two clusters of residues contribute to the activity and substrate specificity of Fm1, a bifunctional oleate and linoleate desaturase of fungal origin.</a></h1><p>Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) have important industrial, physiological, and nutritional properties. Plants use the sequential activities of FAD2 and FAD3 desaturases to convert 18:1Δ9 to the important PUFA 18:3Δ9,12,15, whereas the fungus  7600 uses the bifunctional desaturase Fm1 for both reactions. Here, we used a combination of sequence comparisons, structural modeling, and mutagenesis experiments to investigate Fm1's regioselectivity and identified two functionally relevant clusters of residues that contribute to Fm1 activity. We found that cluster I (Leu, Phe, and His), located near the catalytic iron ions, predominantly affects activity, whereas cluster II (Tyr, His, and Leu), located in a helix forming the entrance to the substrate-binding pocket, mainly specifies 15-desaturation. Individual or combined substitutions of cluster II residues substantially reduced 15-desaturation. The combination of F157W from cluster I with Y280L, H284V, and L287T from cluster II created an increased-activity variant that almost completely lost the ability to desaturate at C15 and acted almost exclusively as a 12-desaturase. No variants were identified in which 15-desaturation occurred in the absence of 12-desaturation. Fm1 displayed only traces of activity with C16 substrate, but several cluster I variants exhibited increased activity with both 18:1 and 16:1 substrates, converting 16:1Δ9 to 16:3Δ9,12,15, consistent with Fm1 performing sequential  + 3 desaturation reactions at C12 and then C15. We propose that cluster II residues interact with the substrate headgroup when the acyl chain contains both Δ9 and Δ12 double bonds, in which case C15 becomes positioned adjacent to the di-iron site enabling a second  + 3 desaturation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30927246>Sodium Orthovanadate Changes Fatty  Composition and Increased Expression of Stearoyl-Coenzyme A Desaturase in THP-1 Macrophages.</a></h1><p>Vanadium compounds are promising antidiabetic agents. In addition to regulating glucose , they also alter . Due to the clear association between diabetes and atherosclerosis, the purpose of the present study was to assess the effect of sodium orthovanadate on the amount of individual fatty acids and the expression of stearoyl-coenzyme A desaturase (SCD or Δ-desaturase), Δ-desaturase, and Δ-desaturase in macrophages. THP-1 macrophages differentiated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) were incubated in vitro for 48 h with 1 μM or 10 μM sodium orthovanadate (NaVO). The estimation of fatty  composition was performed by gas chromatography. Expressions of the genes SCD, fatty  desaturase 1 (FADS1), and fatty  desaturase 2 (FADS2) were tested by qRT-PCR. Sodium orthovanadate in THP-1 macrophages increased the amount of saturated fatty acids (SFA) such as palmitic  and stearic , as well as monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA)- and palmitoleic . Sodium orthovanadate caused an upregulation of SCD expression. Sodium orthovanadate at the given concentrations did not affect the amount of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) such as linoleic , arachidonic , eicosapentaenoic  (EPA), docosapentaenoic  (DPA), and docosahexaenoic  (DHA). In conclusion, sodium orthovanadate changed SFA and MUFA composition in THP-1 macrophages and increased expression of SCD. Sodium orthovanadate did not affect the amount of any PUFA.

Previous studies have suggested that 2OHOA's anticancer effect is mediated by SMS activation in cancer cells, including A549 and U118 cells. To confirm this phenomenon, in this study, we treated both A549 and U118 cells with 2OHOA and measured SMS activity. To our surprise, we found neither 2OHOA-mediated SMS activation nor sphingomyelin accumulation in the cells. However, we noted that 2OHOA significantly reduces phosphatidylcholine in these cells. We also did not observe 2OHOA-mediated SMS activation in mouse tissue homogenates. Importantly, 2OHOA inhibited rather than activated recombinant SMS1 (rSMS1) and rSMS2 in a dose-dependent fashion. Intra-gastric treatment of C57BL/6J mice with 2OHOA for 10 days had no effects on liver and small intestine SMS activities and plasma sphingomyelin levels. The treatment inhibited lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase (LPCAT) activity, consistent with the aforementioned reduction in plasma phosphatidylcholine. Because total cellular phosphatidylcholine is used as a predictive biomarker for monitoring tumor responses, the previously reported 2OHOA-mediated cancer suppression could be related to this phosphatidylcholine reduction, which may influence cell membrane structure and properties. We conclude that 2OHOA is not a SMS activator and that its anticancer property may be related to an effect on phosphatidylcholine .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30535092>Plasma fatty acids in de novo lipogenesis pathway are associated with diabetogenic indicators among adults: NHANES 2003-2004.</a></h1><p>Insulin regulates fatty acids (FAs) in the blood; conversely, FAs may mediate insulin sensitivity and are potentially modifiable risk factors of the diabetogenic state.The objective of our study was to examine the associations between plasma concentrations of FAs, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) among individuals (n = 1433) in the NHANES (2003-2004).Plasma concentrations of 24 individual FAs were considered individually and in subgroups, per chemical structure. Study participants were categorized in diabetogenic groups: Group 1 (HbA1c ≥6.5% or FPG ≥126 mg/dL), Group 2 (HbA1c 5.7% to <6.5% or FPG 100 to <126 mg/dL), and Group 3 (HbA1c <5.7% and FPG <100 mg/dL). We assessed associations between diabetogenic groups and plasma FAs in multivariate multinomial regressions (with Group 3 as the reference).Overall, 7.0% of study participants were in Group 1; 33.3% were in Group 2. Plasma concentrations of several individual FAs, including even-chain saturated FAs (SFAs; myristic, palmitic, stearic acids) and monounsaturated FAs (MUFAs; cis-vaccenic,  acids), were respectively associated with greater odds of Groups 1 and 2 status, adjusting for covariates. Higher concentrations of SFA and MUFA subgroups (highest compared with lowest quartile) were associated with increased odds of Group 2 status [SFAs adjusted OR (aOR): 1.51 (95% CI: 1.05, 2.18); MUFAs aOR: 1.78 (95% CI: 1.11, 2.85)]. Higher eicosapentaenoic  plasma concentration was associated with decreased odds of Group 1 status [quartile 4 aOR: 0.41 (95% CI: 0.17, 0.95)].Higher plasma concentrations of SFAs and MUFAs, primary de novo lipogenesis products, were associated with elevated FPG and HbA1c in a nationally representative study population in the United States.

Palmitic and  VLDL (>80% total VLDL) are not converted in low density lipoproteins (LDL). Atherosclerosis is not an alimentary deficiency of polyenic fatty acids (PFA), but results from low in vivo bioavailability of PFA in LDL against the background of high dietary palmitic FA and palmitic LDL. Plasma PFA content and cellular PFA deficiency are as high as LDL cholesterol (CL). Primary prevention of atherosclerosis should be based on a decrease in dietary content of palmitic saturated FA, trans FA and a moderate increase in PFA. It seems highly unlikely that the xeobiotics statins, fibrates and probucol produce pleiotropic biological effects in vivo. These effects are brought about by phylogenetically early humoral mediators eicosanoids: prostacyclins, prostaglandins, thromboxanes, leukotrienes, and resolvins. It is reasonable to suggest that all preparations which act according to the same algorithm activate TG hydrolysis in VLDL and normalize cellular uptake of PFA in linoleic and linolenic LDL via apoВ-100 endocytosis.

The transport of caffeine, diazepam and mannitol across porcine buccal mucosa was studied in modified Ussing chambers with a hypotonic donor solution, in the presence of levulinic  (LA),  (OA), propylene glycol (PG) as well as sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). Subsequently, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization - mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI-MSI) was applied to image the spatial distribution of caffeine, mannitol and SDS in cross-sections of porcine buccal mucosa. The results revealed that none of the permeation enhancing strategies improved the permeability of caffeine or diazepam, despite impact on the tissue integrity by OA and SDS, as seen by an increased permeability of mannitol. Further studies are needed with OA since PG solvent may have concealed the possible impact of OA. SDS decreased the permeability of caffeine and diazepam, a decrease which can be explained by micellar  extraction and encapsulation in micelles. MALDI-MSI showed that SDS permeated into approximately one-third of the epithelium, and it therefore appears that the main permeability barrier for mannitol is located in the outer epithelium. MALDI-MSI was shown to be a useful method for imaging spatial distribution of drugs and permeations enhancers in buccal mucosa.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Despite an accumulating number of studies, no pharmacotherapy that targets NAFLD has received general approval for clinical use.Sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibition is a promising approach to treat diabetes, obesity, and associated metabolic disorders. In this study, we investigated the effect of a novel SGLT2 inhibitor, NGI001, on NAFLD and obesity-associated metabolic symptoms in high  diet (HFD)-induced obese mice.Delayed intervention with NGI001 protected against body weight gain, hyperglycemia, hyperlipidemia and hyperinsulinemia, compared with HFD alone. Adipocyte hypertrophy was prevented by administering NGI001. NGI001 inhibited impaired glucose  and regulated the secretion of adipokines associated with insulin resistance. In addition, NGI001 supplementation suppressed hepatic  accumulation and inflammation, and had little impact on kidney function. In-depth investigations showed NGI001 ameliorated  deposition and increased AMPK phosphorylation, resulting in phosphorylation of its major downstream target, ACC, in human hepatocytes, HuS-E/2 cells. This cascade ultimately led to the downregulation of downstream fatty  synthesis-related molecules and the upregulation of downstream β oxidation-associated molecules. Surprisingly, NGI001 decreased gene and protein expression of SGLT1 and SGLT2 and glucose uptake in -treated HuS-E/2 cells.Our findings suggest the therapeutic potential of the novel SGLT2 inhibitor, NGI001, to attenuate or delay the onset of diet-induced metabolic diseases and NAFLD.This article is protected by copyright.

The experiment consisted of a 2 × 3 factorial design with two corn types (normal corn and ageing corn) and three concentrations of VE (0, 20 and 100 IU/kg). A total of 216 Lohmann laying hens (50-week-old) were randomly allocated into six treatment diets for 12 week. Each treatment had six replicates with six hens. The results showed that ageing corn significantly reduced average daily feed intake (ADFI; p < 0.01) and egg weight (p < 0.05). Dietary VE supplementation had no significant influences on egg production performance (p > 0.05). Egg yolk colour was decreased in ageing corn diets (p < 0.01), while 20 and 100 IU/kg VE significantly improved vitelline membrane strength (p < 0.01) compared with feeding of 0 IU/kg VE. Ageing corn also significantly decreased the content of cholesterol including total cholesterol (TC; p < 0.05), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C; p < 0.01) and very low density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C; p < 0.05) in the serum. Feeding 100 IU/kg VE significantly increased the content of LDL-C (p < 0.01) and VLDL-C (p < 0.05) in the serum. Furthermore, the content of the , docosahexaenoic  and total monounsaturated fatty  (MUFA) was lower (p < 0.05) and stearic  and total saturated fatty  (SFA) was higher (p < 0.05) in egg yolks in ageing corn diets. Ageing corn resulted in reduced feed intake, egg weights and yolk colour, but the effects of VE supplementation were independent of those of age of corn and were unable to counteract the negative effects of feeding ageing corn.© 2018 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30407633>Triacylglycerol-Lowering Effect of Docosahexaenoic  Is Not Influenced by Single-Nucleotide Polymorphisms Involved in  in Humans.</a></h1><p>The triacylglycerol (TAG)-lowering effects of long-chain n-3 fatty acids, and in particular docosahexaenoic  (DHA), are well documented, although these effects manifest large interindividual variability. The objective of this secondary analysis is to investigate whether common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in genes involved in DHA synthesis and TAG  are associated with the responsiveness of blood lipids, lipoprotein, and apolipoprotein concentration to dietary treatment by DHA supplied in high- canola oil (HOCO). In a randomized, crossover-controlled feeding trial, 129 subjects with metabolic syndrome received high- canola oil (HOCO) and high- canola oil supplemented with DHA (HOCO-DHA), each for 4 weeks. During the HOCO-DHA phase, the intake of DHA ranged from 1 to 2.5 g/day. The subjects were genotyped for apolipoprotein E (APOE) isoforms, and SNP including FADS1-rs174561, FADS2-rs174583, ELOVL2-rs953413, ELOVL5-rs2397142, CETP-rs5882, SCD1-rs2234970, PPARA-rs6008259, and LIPF-rs814628 were selected as important genes controlling fatty  . Overall, consumption of HOCO-DHA oil reduced blood concentrations of TAG by 24% compared to HOCO oil. The reduction in TAG was independent of genetic variations in the studied genes. Similarly, no treatment-by-gene interactions were evident in the response to other lipids, lipoproteins, or apolipoproteins to DHA supplementation. Nevertheless, a lower interindividual variation in the TAG response to DHA supplementation compared to other studies was observed in this analysis. The TAG-lowering effect of a supplemental body-weight-based dose of DHA was not influenced by genetic variations in APOE, FADS1, FADS2, ELOVL2, ELOVL5, CETP, SCD1, PPARA, and LIPF.© 2018 AOCS.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30496314>Increased triacylglycerol - Fatty  substrate cycling in human skeletal muscle cells exposed to eicosapentaenoic .</a></h1><p>It has previously been shown that pretreatment of differentiated human skeletal muscle cells (myotubes) with eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) promoted increased uptake of fatty acids and increased triacylglycerol accumulation, compared to pretreatment with  (OA) and palmitic  (PA). The aim of the present study was to examine whether EPA could affect substrate cycling in human skeletal muscle cells by altering lipolysis rate of intracellular TAG and re-esterification of fatty acids. Fatty   was studied in human myotubes using a mixture of fatty acids, consisting of radiolabelled  as tracer (14C-OA) together with EPA or PA. Co-incubation of myotubes with EPA increased cell-accumulation and incomplete fatty  oxidation of 14C-OA compared to co-incubation with PA.  distribution showed higher incorporation of 14C-OA into all cellular lipids after co-incubation with EPA relative to PA, with most markedly increases (3 to 4-fold) for diacylglycerol and triacylglycerol. Further, the increases in cellular lipids after co-incubation with EPA were accompanied by higher lipolysis and fatty  re-esterification rate. Correspondingly, basal respiration, proton leak and maximal respiration were significantly increased in cells exposed to EPA compared to PA. Microarray and Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis showed that EPA, related to PA, significantly changed i.e. the GO terms "Neutral  metabolic process" and "Regulation of  storage". Finally, an inhibitor of diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 decreased the effect of EPA to promote fatty  accumulation. In conclusion, incubation of human myotubes with EPA, compared to PA, increased processes of fatty  turnover and oxidation suggesting that EPA may activate futile substrate cycling of fatty acids in human myotubes. Increased TAG-FA cycling may be involved in the potentially favourable effects of long-chain polyunsaturated n-3 fatty acids on skeletal muscle and whole-body energy .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31200402>[Insulin resistance is an alimentary deficiency of energy substrates (glucose) in the biological reaction of exotrophy and aphysiology compensation by fatty acids via the biological reaction of endothrophy.]</a></h1><p>The deficiency of energy substrates in the biological function of trophology and biological reaction of exotrophy is formed by two factors. Excess of meat in the diet leads to high content of palmitic fatty  (FA) in hepatocytes and formation of palmitic triglycerides (TG). Post heparin lipoprotein lipase slowly hydrolyzes palmitic TG in blood plasma lipoproteins and releases small amounts of FA. If dietary carbohydrate content is low, the biological function of exotrophy does not provide the substrate from which hepatocytes can rapidly produce  nonesterified FA de novo. Energy substrate deficiency activates the biological function of adaptation and the biological reaction of compensation. Under the effect of epinephrin NEFA deficiency is compensated via the biological reaction of endotrophy and lipolysis in omental visceral  cells. In insulin resistance (IR) syndrome, the biological function of feeding is realized nonphysiologically while the biological reaction of adaptation is realized physiologically. An increase in NEFA blood content physiologically blocks glucose uptake in cells. Biological role of insulin consists in conversion of distant ocean-living carnivorous (fish-eating) ancestors of Homo sapiens with palmitic type of FA  into herbivorous dry land-living species with  type  of FA. The IR syndrome can be normalized. To this end a) the patient's will to activate the cognitive biological function (intellect) and b) comprehension of the fact that phylogenetically dry land-living Homo sapiens has developed as a herbivorous but not carnivorous species. Concerning death rate, cardiovascular pathologies are dominating in populations of many countries, while feeding function disorders prevail in frequency. These disorders form the pathophysiological basis for all metabolic pandemias: 1) atherosclerosis and atheromatosis, 2) essential arterial hypertension, 3) metabolic syndrome, 4) obesity, 5) insulin resistance syndrome, 6) nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and 7) endogenous hyperuricemia. Persistent potential deficiency of energy for realization of all biological reactions and functions is the major metabolic disorders in diabetes mellitus.

Study included 20 patients (64-86 years) with femoral neck fractures, indicated for surgery, and control group of 17 elderly subjects, without fractures or serious chronic diseases. Plasma was obtained during the first 12 hours postfracture and presurgery, and 7 days postop. Compared to control, patients had significantly higher saturated FA (SFA) and monounsaturated FA, as well as increased TNF-α and IL-6. In opposite, levels of individual and total n-6 polyunsaturated FA (PUFA), individual and total n-3 PUFA, n-6/n-3 ratio and levels of thiobarbituric  reactive substances (TBARS) were markedly lower in the patient than controls. On the 7th day after the surgery we showed a further rise in the SFA,  and TNF-α, and reductions of n-6 PUFA and IL-6. Taken together our results suggest that altered FA status, especially reduced PUFA, may influence hip fracture repair and even contribute to femoral fractures susceptibility in the elderly. Potential benefit from nutritional intervention with PUFA in prevention and/or fracture healing should be considered.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30832407>Dietary Polyphenols Protect Against -Induced Steatosis in an in Vitro Model of NAFLD by Modulating  and Improving Mitochondrial Function.</a></h1><p>In this study, we aimed to determine the relative effectiveness of common dietary polyphenols or the isoquinoline alkaloid berberine in protecting against molecular mechanisms underlying non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) involving changes to cellular  and bioenergetics. In a model of steatosis using HepG2 hepatocytes, exposure of the cells to 1.5 mM  (OA) for 24 h caused steatosis and distorted cell morphology, induced the expression of mRNA for enzymes that are involved in lipogenesis and fatty  oxidation ( and ), and impaired indices of aerobic energy  ( mRNA expression, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), and galactose-supported ATP production). Co-treatment with 10 µM of selected polyphenols all strongly protected against the steatosis and changes in cell morphology. All polyphenols, except cyanidin, inhibited the effects on  and  and further increased  expression, suggesting a shift toward increased β-oxidation. Resveratrol, quercetin, catechin, and cyanidin, however not kuromanin or berberine, ameliorated the decreases in MMP and galactose-derived ATP. Berberine was unique in worsening the decrease in galactose-derived ATP. In further investigations of the mechanisms involved, resveratrol, catechin, and berberine increased SIRT1 enzyme activity and p-AMPKα protein, which are involved in mitochondrial biogenesis.

Accompanying these changes, treatment with 6-gingerol attenuates excessive triglyceride accumulation, enhances mitochondrial function, and promotes a transition from a fast- to slow-fiber type and muscle oxidative  in the red gastrocnemius of ageing rats. More importantly, 6-gingerol not only increases the plasma and adipose tissue adiponectin concentrations, but also elevates muscular AdipoR1 expression and activates downstream AMPK phosphorylation as well as upregulates PGC-1α in vivo and in vitro.6-Gingerol may improve ectopic  accumulation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and insulin resistance in skeletal muscle of ageing rats. These effects rely, at least in part, on the elevated plasma adiponectin concentration and muscle AdipoR1 level to dually activate the AMPK/PGC-1α signaling pathway.© 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

In contrast, under phosphorous (P) deprivation, the production of the monounsaturated  prevails. We compared physiological responses, ultrastructural, and metabolic consequences of L. incisa acclimation to N and P deficiency to provide novel insights into the key determinants of ARA accumulation. Differential responses to nutrient deprivation on growth performance, carbon-to-nitrogen stoichiometry, membrane  composition and TAG accumulation were demonstrated. Ultrastructural analyses suggested a dynamic role for vacuoles in sustaining cell homeostasis under conditions of different nutrient availability and their involvement in autophagy in L. incisa. Paralleling ARA-rich TAG accumulation in  droplets, N deprivation triggered intensive chloroplast dismantling and promoted catabolic processes. Metabolome analysis revealed depletion of amino acids and pyrimidines, and repression of numerous biosynthetic hubs to favour TAG biosynthesis under N deprivation. Under P deprivation, despite the relatively low growth penalties, the presence of the endogenous P reserves and the characteristic  remodelling, metabolic signatures of energy deficiency were revealed. Metabolome adjustments to P deprivation included depletion in ATP and phosphorylated nucleotides, increased levels of TCA-cycle intermediates and osmoprotectants. We conclude that characteristic cellular and metabolome adjustments tailor the adaptive responses of L. incisa to N and P deprivation modulating its LC-PUFA production.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

We show here that Minerval also acts, selectively in cancer cell lines, as an ATP depleting uncoupler of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos). As a function of its exposure time, Minerval compromised the capacity of glioblastoma U87-MG cells to compensate for aberrant respiration by up-modulation of glycolysis. This effect was not exposure time-dependent in the lung carcinoma A549 cell line, which was more sensitive to Minerval. Compared with OxPhos inhibitors FCCP (uncoupler), rotenone (electron transfer inhibitor), and oligomycin (F1F0-ATPase inhibitor), Minerval action was similar only to that of FCCP. This similarity was manifested by mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) depolarization, facilitation of oxygen consumption rate (OCR), restriction of mitochondrial and cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and mitochondrial fragmentation. Additionally, compared with other OxPhos inhibitors, Minerval uniquely induced ER stress in cancer cell lines. These new modes of action for Minerval, capitalizing on the high fatty  requirements of cancer cells, can potentially enhance its cancer-selective toxicity and improve its therapeutic capacity.© 2019 The Author(s).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30403720>PRY-1/Axin signaling regulates  in Caenorhabditis elegans.</a></h1><p>The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans constitutes a leading animal model to study how signaling pathway components function in conserved biological processes. Here, we describe the role of an Axin family member, PRY-1, in . Axins are scaffolding proteins that play crucial roles in signal transduction pathways by physically interacting with multiple factors and coordinating the assembly of protein complexes. Genome-wide transcriptome profiling of a pry-1 mutant revealed differentially regulated genes that are associated with  such as vitellogenins (yolk lipoproteins), fatty  desaturases, lipases, and fatty  transporters. Consistent with these categorizations, we found that pry-1 is crucial for the maintenance of  levels. Knockdowns of vit genes in a pry-1 mutant background restored  levels, suggesting that vitellogenins contribute to PRY-1 function in  metabolic processes. Additionally, lowered expression of desaturases and lipidomic analysis provided evidence that fatty  synthesis is reduced in pry-1 mutants. Accordingly, an exogenous supply of  restored depleted lipids in somatic tissues of worms. Overall, our findings demonstrate that PRY-1/Axin signaling is essential for  and involves the regulation of yolk proteins.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30943799>Omega-3 fatty  decreases  by decreasing SCD-1 expression in the liver and kidney of a cyclosporine-induced nephropathy rat model.</a></h1><p>Stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD)-1 and elongase-6 (Elovl-6) are associated with fatty  (FA) synthesis.

Due to the growing economic burden of NAFLD on public health, it has become an emergent target for clinical intervention. DUSP12 is a member of the dual specificity phosphatase (DUSP) family, which plays important roles in brown adipocyte differentiation, microbial infection, and cardiac hypertrophy. However, the role of DUSP12 in NAFLD has yet to be clarified. Here, we reveal that DUSP12 protects against hepatic steatosis and inflammation in L02 cells after palmitic / treatment. We demonstrate that hepatocyte specific DUSP12-deficient mice exhibit high- diet (HFD)-induced and high- high-cholesterol diet-induced hyperinsulinemia and liver steatosis and decreased insulin sensitivity. Consistently, DUSP12 overexpression in hepatocyte could reduce HFD-induced hepatic steatosis, insulin resistance, and inflammation. At the molecular level, steatosis in the absence of DUSP12 was characterized by elevated apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1), which mediates the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway and hepatic . DUSP12 physically binds to ASK1, promotes its dephosphorylation, and inhibits its action on ASK1-related proteins, JUN N-terminal kinase, and p38 MAPK in order to inhibit lipogenesis under high- conditions.

Recent findings indicate that natural history of nonalcoholic fatty liver is regulated, in part, by endogenous cannabinoids. Metformin is an oral hypoglycemic medication which inhibits gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis in hepatocytes and limits  storage in the liver through the inhibition of free fatty  formation via induction of activated protein kinase activity (AMPK). Both endocannabinoids and metformin may modulate hepatosteatosis; therefore, it was interesting to examine whether metformin may affect  accumulation in hepatocytes by acting on cannabinoid receptors, CB1 and CB2, in in vitro study. Hep3B cells were incubated with or without metformin (Met), phosphatidylcholine (PC), and  (OA). Cells without any of the examined substances served as negative control. Cells treated only with OA served as positive control. The quantity of intracellular lipids was assessed using Oil-Red-O staining. Selective CB1R agonist, arachidonyl-2-chloromethylamide (ACEA), and CB2R agonist, AM1241 (2-iodo-5-nitrophenyl)-[1-(methylpiperidin-2-ylmethyl)-1 H-indol-3-yl]methanone, were also used to treat Hep3B cells. In some experiments, antagonist for CB1R, AM6545, or SR144528 as selective antagonist of CB2R were used. In the study, Met decreased  accumulation in cells treated with OA and inhibited CB1R agonist-induced  accumulation in hepatocytes. The CB2R agonist-induced hepatic  accumulation was not inhibited by metformin. The results indicate that metformin may interact with endocannabinoid system in the liver by inhibiting CB1R agonist-stimulated  accumulation in hepatocytes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30811959>Maternal obesity results in decreased syncytiotrophoblast synthesis of palmitoleic , a fatty  with anti-inflammatory and insulin-sensitizing properties.</a></h1><p>The fetus is dependent on delivery of fatty acids (FAs) by the syncytiotrophoblast, the transporting epithelium of the human placenta. Obese pregnant women have dyslipidemia; however, whether obesity impacts placental  transport and  remains to be fully established. Palmitoleic  (POA), an FA with anti-inflammatory and insulin-sensitizing properties, is synthesized from palmitic  (PA) catalyzed by stearoyl-coenzyme A desaturase (SCD) activity. We hypothesized that the uptake and incorporation of FAs and POA synthesis are reduced in primary human trophoblasts (PHTs) isolated from pregnancies complicated by maternal obesity. Villous cytotrophoblasts were isolated from 7 placentas of obese [body mass index (BMI) = 37.5 ± 1.9] and 12 normal (BMI = 23.6 ± 0.6) mothers. FA uptake and incorporation were assessed using uniformly labeled (U[C])-FA mixtures of PA,  (OA), linoleic , and docosahexaenoic . Cellular [C] FAs were quantified both in total cellular lipids and in  classes by GC-MS. Uptake and incorporation of [C] FAs in total cellular lipids were not different in PHTs isolated from obese mothers compared with normal mothers. Only the concentration of OA was increased in the triglyceride fraction ( < 0.05) if the mother was obese. We found an isotopic enrichment of POA after U[C]-PA treatment, demonstrating SCD activity in PHT cells. Labeled POA content and the POA:PA ratio were significantly lower in PHTs isolated from placentas of obese mothers compared with normal, healthy controls.

Herein, we report the mechanism and kinetics of absorption, , and distribution of the endogenously detectable and prototypical NO-FA, 10-nitro- (10-NO-OA), in dogs after oral administration. Supported by HPLC-high-resolution-MS/MS analysis of synthetic and plasma-derived 10-NO-OA-containing triacylglycerides (TAGs), we show that a key mechanism of NO-FA distribution is an initial esterification into complex lipids. Quantitative analysis of plasma free and esterified  fractions confirmed time-dependent preferential incorporation of 10-NO-OA into TAGs when compared with its principal metabolite, 10-nitro-stearic . Finally, new isomers of 10-NO-OA were identified in vivo, and their electrophilic reactivity and  characterized. Overall, we reveal that NO-FAs display unique PK, with the principal mechanism of tissue distribution involving complex  esterification, which serves to shield the electrophilic character of this mediator from plasma and hepatic inactivation and thus permits efficient distribution to target organs.Copyright © 2019 Fazzari et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30724257>Physicochemical characteristics of  blend from hydrogenated coconut oil and acyl migrated palm mid-fraction.</a></h1><p>Palm mid-fraction (PMF), which has a high content of symmetric POP, was converted to asymmetric PPO (APMF) via acyl migration. After solvent fractionation, the liquid phase of acyl migrated PMF (APMF-L) was obtained and blended with hydrogenated coconut oil (HCO, 50:50, w/w) to produce a  blend (namely, an alternative  blend) which had reduced saturated fatty  content while having similar melting behavior to HCO. In an alternative  blend, the major fatty acids were lauric (27.94), palmitic (26.93) and  (15.75 mol%) . The solid  index was quite similar to that of HCO, especially at 28-44 °C. Nevertheless, an alternative  blend had lower saturated fatty  content, by 18%, compared to HCO. The content of highly atherogenic myristic  was reduced by approximately 40%. The alternative  blend in this study could be used as a raw material for non-dairy cream with low saturated  content.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

However, mammalian skeletal muscles are composed of mixed types of muscle fibers. In the current study, we analyzed and compared the distributions of titin, , phosphate ions, and fatty  levels in red and white muscles using a fish model (), which is rich in red and white muscles, and these are well separated. Oil-red O staining showed that red muscle had more-abundant lipids than did white muscle. A time-of-flight secondary-ion mass spectrometric (TOF-SIMS) analysis revealed that red muscle possessed high levels of palmitic  and , but white muscle contained more phosphate ions. Moreover, elastica-van Gieson (EVG) and Mito-Tracker green FM staining showed that collagen and elastic fibers were highly, respectively, distributed in connective tissues and mitochondria in red muscle. An electron micrographic analysis indicated that red muscle had a relatively higher number of mitochondria and longer sarcomere lengths and Z-line widths, while myofibril diameters were thicker in white muscle. Myofibrillar proteins separated by SDS-PAGE showed that the major giant protein, titin, was highly expressed in white muscle than in red muscle. Furthermore, ratios of titin to myosin heavy chain (MHC) (titin/MHC) were about 1.3 times higher in white muscle than red muscle. We postulated that white muscle is fit for short and strong contractile performance due to high levels of titin and condensed sarcomeres, whereas red muscle is fit for low intensity and long-lasting activity due to high levels of lipids and mitochondria and long sarcomeres.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31168311>A high- diet induces rapid changes in the mouse hypothalamic proteome.</a></h1><p>Prolonged over-consumption of a high- diet (HFD) commonly leads to obesity and insulin resistance. However, even 3 days of HFD consumption has been linked to inflammation within the key homeostatic brain region, the hypothalamus.Mice were fed either a low- diet (LFD) or HFD containing 10% or 60% (Kcal) respectively from  for 3 days. Mice were weighed, food intake measured and glucose tolerance calculated using intraperitoneal glucose tolerance tests (IPGTT). Proteomic analysis was carried out to determine if hypothalamic proteins were changed by a HFD. The direct effects of dietary fatty acids on mitochondrial morphology and on one of the proteins most changed by a HFD, dihydropyrimidinase-related protein 2 (DRP-2) a microtubule-associated protein which regulates microtubule dynamics, were also tested in mHypoE-N42 (N42) neuronal cells challenged with palmitic  (PA) and  (OA).Mice on the HFD, as expected, showed increased adiposity and glucose intolerance. Hypothalamic proteomic analysis revealed changes in 104 spots after 3 days on HFD, which, when identified by LC/MS/MS, were found to represent 78 proteins mainly associated with cytoskeleton and synaptic plasticity, stress response, glucose  and mitochondrial function. Over half of the changed proteins have also been reported to be changed in neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease. Also,in N42 neurons mitochondrial morphology and DRP-2 levels were altered by PA but not by OA.These results demonstrate that within 3 days, there is a relatively large effect of HFD on the hypothalamic proteome indicative of cellular stress, altered synaptic plasticity and mitochondrial function, but not inflammation. Changes in N42 cells show an effect of PA but not OA on DRP-2 and on mitochondrial morphology indicating that long-chain saturated fatty acids damage neuronal function.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31063536>Prepartum fatty  supplementation in sheep. IV. Effect of calcium salts with eicosapentaenoic  and docosahexaenoic  in the maternal and finishing diet on lamb liver and adipose tissue during the lamb finishing period1.</a></h1><p>The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of eicosapentaenoic  (EPA) and docosahexaenoic  (DHA) supplementation to ewes during late gestation on finishing lamb liver and adipose tissue fatty  (FA) profile and gene expression. Lambs born from ewes supplemented with Ca salts of EPA + DHA, or palm FA distillate (PFAD) high in palmitic and  at 0.39% DM during the last 50 d of gestation were used. Lambs were weaned at 61 d of age and adapted to a high concentrate diet for 1.5 mo. After adaptation, 74 lambs (28 pens) were blocked by sex and BW and used in a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement of treatments using the factors of dam supplementation (DS) and lamb supplementation (LS) of Ca salts of EPA + DHA or PFAD at 1.48% DM. Lambs were slaughtered after 42 d and liver and adipose tissue collected for FA and gene expression analysis. Liver concentrations of EPA and DHA were greater (P < 0.01) with LS of EPA + DHA vs. PFAD during the finishing period. In adipose tissue, a lamb × dam interaction was observed for EPA (P = 0.02) and DHA (P = 0.04); LS of EPA + DHA increased EPA and DHA, but the increase was greatest in lambs born from ewes supplemented with PFAD. No lamb × dam treatment interactions were observed for gene expression in liver tissue (P > 0.10). Hepatic mRNA abundance of hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL; P = 0.01) was greater in lambs born from EPA + DHA ewes vs. lambs from PFAD ewes. mRNA expression of stearoyl-CoA desaturase (P < 0.01), fatty  synthase (P = 0.01), Δ5-desaturase (P < 0.01), and Δ6-desaturase (P < 0.01) were decreased in liver of EPA + DHA lambs. A significant lamb × dam diet interaction was observed for elongation of very long chain fatty  2 in adipose tissue (P = 0.01); lambs supplemented with the same FA as their dams had lower expression. Expression of HSL tended (P = 0.08) to be decreased in adipose of EPA + DHA lambs born from EPA + DHA ewes. The changes in mRNA expression suggest that lipogenesis decreased, and lipolysis increased in lamb liver with EPA + DHA vs. PFAD supplementation during the finishing period. In adipose tissue, changes suggest that lipogenesis decreased in lambs born from EPA + DHA supplemented dams and supplemented with EPA + DHA during the finishing period. In addition, these results suggest an interaction between supplementation of FA to dams during late gestation on lamb response of adipose tissue, but not liver, to FA supplementation during the finishing period.© The Author(s) 2019.

Daming capsule (DMC), a medicine for lowering blood lipids, is marketed in China; however, its mechanism is unclear. The present study aimed to investigate the mechanism by which DMC reduces blood lipids.A rat model of hyperlipidaemia was established by feeding rats a high- diet (HFD), and the serum  levels were detected with an automatic biochemical analyser. DMC (162 mg/kg) and atorvastatin calcium (10 mg/kg) were orally administered to the hyperlipidaemic rats for 4 weeks. HFD feeding markedly induced increases in the levels of total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c); however, DMC treatment significantly decreased the levels of TC, TG, and LDL-c in rats serum. Meanwhile, the hepatic TC and TG levels, liver weight/body weight ratio, and body weight were significantly lower in the DMC-treated rats than in the HFD rats. Moreover, DMC significantly alleviated hepatomegaly, hepatic  deposition, and hepatic steatosis. The protein expression level of phospho-adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (p-AMPK) (Thr172) in HFD rat livers was lower than that in normal rat livers, whereas it increased in the liver of the DMC-treated rats; however, the protein expression level of total-AMPK in the liver was not different among the groups. The AMPK-activating effect of DMC was blocked by Compound C (a specific AMPK inhibitor) in HepG2 cells. Additionally, DMC considerably increased peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPARα) protein expression and lipoprotein lipase (LPL) transcription and concentration in the liver. This effect of DMC was also inhibited by Compound C in HepG2 cells. DMC also promoted LDL receptor (LDLR) protein expression by activating AMPK. We further found that DMC reduced the levels of TC and TG in -treated HepG2 cells, and it restored the expression levels of p-AMPK, PPARα, LPL, and LDLR compared to the decreased levels observed in -treated HepG2 cells.DMC lowered lipids in serum and the liver by activating AMPK. On the one hand, the activation of AMPK enhanced PPARα expression and LPL transcription to lead to the hydrolysis of TG; on the other hand, it increased LDLR protein expression to promote .Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Increasing cardiac PA levels, resulted in shortened atrial action potential duration, and increased I density. Inhibition of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) prevented increases in I due to PA. Acute (≥1hr) exposure of atrial myocytes to exogenous PA (1 mM) increased the density of the rapid delayed rectifier potassium current I, while it was decreased with the unsaturated  (OA, 1 mM). Serine-threonine protein phosphatase-2 (PP2A) inhibition with cantharidin reversed the effect of OA on I.Our data provide evidence of a novel lipotoxic guinea pig model with signs of vulnerability to arrhythmias. Inhibition of PA/PI3K/I and/or activation of the OA/PP2A/I pathways may be therapeutically beneficial for lipotoxic arrhythmias.Copyright © 2019 The Author. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Lauric C12 LC is half the FA in coconut oil. Residents of southeast Asia with constant use of coconut oil, have a low level of diseases of the cardiovascular system in the population. With a regulatory intake with food C12:0 laurin FA formed moderate ketosis and neuroprotective effect. Unlike long-chain LC, medium-chain TG cells are not deposited either in visceral  cells, or in insulin-dependent adipocytes. Medium-chain fatty acids rapidly oxidize mitochondria; the formation of acetyl-CoA cells is used to form ketone bodies, activating thermogenesis in orange and brown adipocytes. Experiments with animals and observations in the clinic showed that taking medium-chain TG with food is more physiological than long-chain oils. This significantly increases the level of cholesterol in high-density lipoproteins. Food enriched with medium chain TG is optimal for increasing the ketone content in blood plasma, cerebrospinal fluid without limiting the carbohydrate content in food. The formation of excess ketone bodies by cells can be achieved by activating the metabolic transformations of medium-chain FAs, without fasting and preserving carbohydrates in food. Coconut oil has a positive effect on the cardiovascular system, preventing the formation of atherosclerosis and atheromatosis. Effective in the prevention of the pathology of the cardiovascular system is a decrease in food amounts of palmitic , an increase in , polyene FA with a simultaneous increase in the proportion of medium-chain FA.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31049862>Outdoor cultivation of the green microalga Chlorella vulgaris under stress conditions as a feedstock for biofuel.</a></h1><p>The present work investigated the potential of the green alga Chlorella vulgaris to produce high-quality biofuel under culture stress conditions. The cultivation was carried out in a 1000 l open plate tank system, which provides biomass yields comparable to open pond systems, but with less area needed. Algal biomass and  content were measured repeatedly. We compared the two solvent systems n-hexane and hexane/isopropanol (HIP) for extraction efficiency of lipids and applied three different extraction methods Soxhlet, soaking, and soaking followed by Soxhlet (soak-Sox). The combination of the HIP solvent and the soak-Sox provided the highest  yield (15.8 ± 0.174). Volumetric biomass and  productivity were 0.201 g l day and 31.71 mg l day, respectively, whereas areal biomass and  productivity were 25.73 g m day and 4.066 g m day, respectively. The fatty  profile by means of gas chromatography resulted in seven fatty acids from C to C. The most abundant fatty  methyl esters (FAMES) were palmitic (C16:0),  (C18:1), and stearic (C18:0) acids.  synthesis enhanced by optimizing the Kuhl growth medium with replacing nitrate by urea (50% N compared to the original recipe) increased salt content (10 g/l NaCl), ferrous sulfate (0.5 g/l), and sodium acetate addition (1 g/l). With regard to density, kinematic viscosity, gravity, pour point, flash point, and cetane number, the Chlorella-biodiesel comply with ASTM and EN standards thus pointing at the high potential of lipids synthesized by Chlorella as a feedstock for biodiesel production.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30369957>Hepatoprotective and Antioxidant Activities of Oil from Baru Almonds ( Vog.) in a Preclinical Model of Lipotoxicity and Dyslipidemia.</a></h1><p>The oil obtained from baru ( Vog.) almonds exhibits high energy value and is reported in popular medicine for the treatment of rheumatic diseases and reproductive disturbances. Although baru oil is used in domestic cuisine, the chemical characterization of this oil and its effects on  are still poorly understood. Therefore, this study evaluated the fatty  (FA) profile and the effects of baru oil on liver and aorta in a murine model of dyslipidemia. The chromatographic profile of baru oil showed high levels of unsaturated FAs, especially . Saturated FAs, such as palmitic and lignoceric acids, were found in lower amounts. Hypercholesterolemia was induced in male Wistar rats by daily administration of a  emulsion by gavage for 15 weeks. Biochemical and histopathological analysis were performed on serum, aorta, and liver. The results demonstrated that animals developed marked hypercholesterolemia, liver steatosis, and increased  peroxidation in the aorta. Treatment with baru oil attenuated  peroxidation and drastically reduced liver damage, especially ballooning degeneration and steatosis. By restricting vascular and hepatic injury, this oil showed potential applicability as a functional food, reinforcing its use in popular medicine and domestic cuisine.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30669785>[Establishment and optimization of hepatocyte steatosis model].</a></h1><p> To establish a new model of hepatic steatosis cells by optimizing the original ethanol or high , the present study proposed an in vitro hepatocyte steatosis model for the study of fatty liver.  Oil red O staining was used to observe the effects of fetal bovine serum,  and ethanol on  accumulation in human liver cell line L02 in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. RT-PCR was used to detect the mRNA expression levels of PPAR-γ and AP-2, and the suitable conditions for the establishment of hepatocyte steatosis model were screened out. A t-test was used for comparison between the two groups, and one-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was used in more than three groups.  Oil red O staining showed the number of reddish-orange  droplets in L02 cells gradually increased with the increase of fetal bovine serum,  and ethanol in a concentration - and time-dependent manner. Compared with 0.00%  and 2% ethanol, the count value of red particle was 100.00% ± 17.63% at the beginning and after 24 h, 0.003%  and 2% ethanol jointly acted in L02 cells. After incubation for 48 hours with 2% ethanol and serum-free DMEM medium, the accumulation of  droplets was the highest with a count value of 802.38%+71.06%( = 42.36,  < 0.001). RT-PCR analysis showed the  accumulation induced by this method was positively correlated with the mRNA expression of PPAR-γ and AP-2.  L02 cells were successfully exposed to high  and ethanol, and the hepatocyte steatosis model was established and optimized, suggesting that the occurrence of hepatic cell steatosis was related to the up-regulation of PPAR-γ and AP-2.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30657682>Application of Trichoderma Strains and Metabolites Enhances Soybean Productivity and Nutrient Content.</a></h1><p>Trichoderma fungi are effectively marketed worldwide as biocontrol agents and plant biostimulants on numerous crops due to their demonstrated effects in direct antagonism against fungal pathogens and plant growth promotion.

Significant promotion of plant growth (up to 39%), as well as an increase in mineral content, was achieved with BAMs, used alone or combined with T. harzianum. Interestingly, the treatments also increased the level of fatty acids (, linolenic, 11-eicosenoic, and stearic).

In this study, VHb was expressed in oleaginous yeast, Yarrowia lipolytica, and its effect on  accumulation was analysed. During fermentation, the dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration was controlled at 5, 10, 20 and 30 of full O saturation and also uncontrolled by varying the stirring speed and aeration rate. Yarrowia lipolytica harbouring the VHb gene (VHb strain) displayed more pseudomycelium than the control strain (VHb strain), and VHb expression also enhanced the cell density. When DO level was controlled at 30%, the biomass of VHb strains reached about 19 g l and increased by 27% compared to VHb strains. Total fatty  contents, although, were higher in VHb strains than in VHb strains under all DO levels, and maximally increased by c. 40% (from 10·5 to 14·5% of the biomass) when the DO concentration was controlled at 30%. VHb overexpression, however, markedly suppressed citrate secretion. In addition, expression of VHb also induced significant changes in fatty  composition and increased the  content. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Genetic modification by overexpressing Vitreoscilla haemoglobin (VHb) is an efficient and economic method for improving O utilization for microbial fermentation. In this study, VHb was expressed in Yarrowia lipolytica, which is a most attractive model for microbial oil production because of its excellent  accumulation capacity and convenient genetic tools. Expression of VHb resulted in  accumulation increased and cell morphology shift, however, markedly suppressed citrate secretion.

In river buffalo, the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) g.133A>C in the gene promoter has been associated with milk quality and yield. However, the biological reason for such effects remains unexplored. In this study, we combined mRNA profile analysis, an electromobility shift assay, and quantitative PCR to elucidate the role of this SNP on gene transcription and its effects on milk  traits. A preliminary genotyping of g.133A>C was carried out on a group of 303 river buffaloes to choose individuals for the downstream applications. Analysis of allele frequencies showed an increase in the minor allele C (0.25) compared with previous findings (0.16). Six animals (2 for each genotype) were chosen for cloning and 216 positive cDNA recombinant clones for SCD (72 per genotype) were analyzed by PCR. All clones showed the same length on agarose gel; therefore, random clones were chosen for sequencing. No qualitative differences were found and all gene transcripts assembled correctly. An electrophoretic mobility shift assay was performed to evaluate the binding of the transcription factor Sp1 to DNA sequences including g.133A>C. Genotype CC showed a higher binding (mean ± standard error of the mean) than genotype AA in 2 different conditions [Enzo buffer (EB), Enzo Life Science Inc., Farmingdale, NY: 201.77 ± 4.06 vs. 141.65 ± 3.77 band intensity values and Poletto buffer (PB): 95.90 ± 1.15 vs. 67.30 ± 2.14 band intensity values]. The subsequent quantitative PCR confirmed the upregulation of the CC genotype compared with the AA and AC genotypes. The association study with milk  traits revealed a favorable effect of allele C. The heterozygous genotype had the highest values for monounsaturated fatty acids,  (C18:1 cis-9), polyunsaturated fatty acids, and odd- and branched-chain fatty acids, and the lowest values for saturated fatty acids and atherogenic and thrombogenic indices; the heterozygous genotype differed significantly from the AA genotype. The AC genotype has previously been associated with higher milk yield. Therefore, the g.133A>C SNP is a marker with dual effects and is an interesting candidate for assisted selection programs in river buffalo. These data clarified the biological role of the SNP g.133A>C in the SCD promoter and how it affects gene function, providing important knowledge on the genetic background of , including the future possibility of selecting alleles with quantitatively or qualitatively favorable effects.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

Our previous studies indicated that cherry anthocyanins (CACN) protected against high  diet-induced obesity and NALFD in C57BL/6 mice, while the underlying molecule mechanism is still unclear. Thus, in this study, we show that CACN protect against - (OA-) induced oxidative stress and attenuate  droplet accumulation in NAFLD cell models. According to the results of a transmission electron microscope (TEM), western blot, immunofluorescence (IF), and adenovirus transfection (Ad-mCherry-GFP-LC3B), autophagy is in accordance with the -lowering effect induced by CACN. Further studies illustrate that CACN may activate autophagy via mTOR pathways. In addition, an autophagy inhibitor, 3-methyladenine (3-MA), was applied and the result suggested that autophagy indeed participates in the  clearance process in OA-induced  accumulation.

Biochemical indexes, intracellular reactive oxygen species production,  droplets accumulation, antioxidant enzymes production, and mitochondrial membrane potential were determined to show the alleviation performance of BFE intervention (P < 0.05). Importantly, the results of qRT-PCR and western blot determination indicated that BFE intervention upregulated the expression of Nrf2/HO-1/NQO1 to initiate the antioxidant defense response for counteracting oxidative stress (P < 0.05). Moreover, mitochondrial membrane potential-mediated apoptosis and FOXO signaling pathway initiation caused by BFE intervention may together contribute to oxidative stress alleviation in HepG2 cells.

The involvement of signaling pathway molecules and pro-inflammatory cytokines related to NF-κB and MAPKs were examined with Western blot and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analyses and further evaluated with inhibitor treatment and RNA interference.HepG2 cells accumulated more intracellular lipids when stimulated with P. gingivalis LPS, as compared to cells treated with E. coli LPS or control. Further pathway analysis demonstrated that after stimulation with P. gingivalis LPS, cells displayed significantly upregulated MyD88 expression, increased phosphorylation of p65 and JNK, and more release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1, IL-8, and TNF-α. In addition, suppression of phosphorylation of p65 and JNK by inhibitors and RNA interference resulted in a reduction in  accumulation upon P. gingivalis LPS treatment.These results suggest that P. gingivalis-derived LPS may contribute to intracellular  accumulation and inflammatory reaction of HepG2 cells via the activation of NF-κB and JNK signaling pathways. This study offers a possible explanation to the functional involvement of P. gingivalis infection in the pathological progression of NAFLD. These findings may help design new treatment strategies in NAFLD.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons A/S. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

In this study, we investigated the potential protective effects of docosahexaenoic  (DHA) on inhibiting  (OA)-induced apoptosis and inflammation in grass carp hepatocytes. Firstly, the hepatocyte of grass carp were treated with OA (800 μM) and different concentration (0, 50, 100 and 200 μM) of DHA for 24 h, the apoptotic ratio, gene expression levels of apoptosis such as caspase 3, caspase 8, and caspase 9, protein levels of Caspase3, and mRNA levels of inflammation genes such as nf-kb, tnf-α, and il-8 were detected. Furthermore, the mRNA levels of lipogenesis genes srebp1c, fas, acc, and scd and a key enzyme of lipolysis Atgl were also detected. These results showed that the cell apoptosis and the inflammation increased by OA were significantly attenuated by DHA (P < 0.05). Furthermore, DHA could significantly decrease fatty  synthesis gene expression levels which were induced by OA (P < 0.05). However, the hepatocytes exposed with DHA had no significant influence on the expression of Atgl. Taken together, the study indicated that DHA protects the hepatocytes against apoptosis and inflammation induced by OA might via inhibiting fatty  synthesis, instead of promoting lipolysis. These results call for further studies to assess the effectiveness of DHA.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30694347>Non-obesogenic doses of fatty acids modulate the functionality of the circadian clock in the liver.</a></h1><p>Saturated fatty acids, such as palmitate, lead to circadian disruption in cell culture. Moreover, information regarding the effects of unsaturated fatty acids on circadian parameters is scarce. We aimed at studying the effects of low doses of saturated as well as unsaturated fatty acids on circadian  in vivo and at deciphering the mechanism by which fatty acids convey their effect. Mice were fed non-obesogenic doses of palm or olive oil and hepatocytes were treated with palmitate and oleate. Mice fed non-obesogenic doses of palm oil showed increased signaling towards fatty  synthesis, while olive oil increased signaling towards fatty  oxidation. Low doses of palmitate and oleate were sufficient to alter circadian rhythms, due to changes in the expression and/or activity of key metabolic proteins. Palmitate, but not oleate, counteracted the reduction in  accumulation and BMAL1-induced expression of mitochondrial genes involved in fatty  oxidation. Palmitate was also found to interfere with the transcriptional activity of CLOCK:BMAL1 by preventing BMAL1 deacetylation and activation. In addition, palmitate, but not oleate, reduced PER2-mediated transcriptional activation and increased REV-ERBα-mediated transcriptional inhibition of Bmal1. The inhibition of PER2-mediated transcriptional activation by palmitate was achieved by interfering with PER2 nuclear translocation. Indeed, PER2 reduced  accumulation in hepatocytes and this reduction was prevented by palmitate. Herein, we show that the detrimental metabolic alteration seen with high doses of palmitate manifests itself early on even with non-obesogenic levels. This is achieved by modulating BMAL1 at several levels abrogating its activity and expression.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31573329> promotes cell invasion through an integrin-linked kinase signaling pathway in renal cell carcinoma.</a></h1><p>The change of fatty  composition has been regarded as an indicator of altered  during human tumourigenesis, but the details are still unclear. We have previously demonstrated a monounsaturated fatty  (MUFA) named  (OA) was involved in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) cell growth, as an extracellular signaling molecule to regulate 786-O cell proliferation via the integrin-linked kinase (ILK) pathway. In this study, we further observe the effects of OA on cell invasion of RCC and the potential mechanism by which OA worked was determined. The transwell invasion assay showed OA increased cell invasion of RCC in a dose-dependent manner. Western blotting results indicated ILK, COX-2, and MMP-9 proteins were involved for their high expressions and these effects were reversed when down-regulating the expression of ILK by special siRNA. The MMPs inhibitor GM6001 could weaken the abilities of OA on RCC cells invasion. These results suggested MUFA indeed affected cell invasion of RCC, which was depended by the regulation of ILK pathway.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30340105>Asiatic  from Potentilla chinensis alleviates non-alcoholic fatty liver by regulating endoplasmic reticulum stress and .</a></h1><p>Endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) is induced by accumulation of misfolded proteins, playing a pivotal role during the processes of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The present study was to investigate the effect of Asiatic  from Potentilla chinensis (AAPC) on liver cell , exploring the underlying mechanism of AAPC against NAFLD. In vivo, the animal NAFLD model was induced by feeding rats with high  diet (HFD) for 18 weeks, and meanwhile the rats were treated with AAPC from weeks 8 to 18; In vitro experiment, the effect of AAPC on dyslipidemia induced by  (OA) in hepatic cells (HepG2) was evaluated. The results showed that AAPC significantly decreased lipidosis in rats and in HepG2 cells; it notably alleviated hepatocyte damage and  disturbance in rats. Moreover, the cell experiments showed that AAPC strongly inhibited HepG2 cell proliferation. It markedly decreased hepatocyte lipogenesis by regulating the key -related factors, such as sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c (SREBP-1c), encoding carboxylase, liver X Receptor Rα (LXRα), fatty  synthase (FAS), and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). The further study elucidated that AAPC treatment significantly alleviated inflammatory response by inhibiting the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kB) pathway. Moreover, AAPC significantly alleviated hepatocyte apoptosis and  disorder through reducing the extent of ERS. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that AAPC significantly ameliorates NAFLD by inhibiting the ERS pathway and  deposition, which may be a potential natural medicine for the treatment of NAFLD.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

However, its impact on atherosclerosis has not been examined in detail.LDL receptor knock out (LDLR-KO) mice are fed a Western diet supplemented with 5% (w/w) palmitoleate concentrate, -rich olive oil, or none (control) for 12 weeks. Dietary palmitoleate increases hepatic C16:1 levels, improves plasma and hepatic /lipoprotein profiles (≈40% decrease in triglycerides), and reduces the atherosclerotic plaque area by ≈45% compared with control or olive oil group (p < 0.05). These favorable changes are accompanied by the downregulation of key genes, such as Srebp1c, Scd1, Il-1β, and Tnfα. ApoB-depleted plasma from mice fed palmitoleate has increased cholesterol efflux capacity by 20% from ABCA1-expressing cells (p < 0.05). A beneficial effect of palmitoleate on glucose  (54% decreased in HOMA-IR, p < 0.05) is also observed.Dietary-supplemented palmitoleate reduces atherosclerosis development in LDLR-KO mice, and is associated with improvement of  and glucose  and favorable changes in regulatory genes involved in lipogenesis and inflammation. These findings imply the potential role of dietary palmitoleate in the prevention of cardiovascular disease and diet-induced metabolic disorders.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The study focussed on the general patterns of starch and  synthesis and storage and to further assess how photosynthetic carbon partitioning into starch and  is altered by conditions in growth media such as N and C presence as seen in BG11 medium which are known to induce neutral  production and the lack of it in BBM and TAP medium. BG-11 medium performed better as compared to BBM and TAP medium in terms of biomass productivity and  yield. The  yield was highest in Botryococcus sp. (63.03% dry wt.) and Chlorella sp. (50.27% dry wt.) at 30th day of incubation. Mean biomass productivity was highest for Botryococcus in BBM medium (6.14 mg/L/day) and for Chlorella in BG-11 medium (4.97 mg/L/day). Mean  productivity (50.78% and 39.36%) was highest in BG11 medium for both Botryococcus and Chlorella species, respectively. A sharp decline in sugar content was observed in the late stationary phase of growth from 30th day to 45th day. Fatty  methyl ester (FAME) profile of the extracted lipids showed predominantly , followed by palmitic  and stearic  in both the strains when grown in BG-11 medium. The other biodiesel quality parameters were in accordance with the international standards. A complex relationship was found between chemical composition and biodiesel properties. Proximity analysis indicated that the fuel properties of biodiesels are determined by a number of parameters and by the combination of different chemical compositions. The results provide an insight into organic carbon partitioning into  compounds and how the organism's  changes due to N-deplete culturing in TAP medium and inorganic carbon source availability as seen in BG-11 and BBM medium.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30553054>High- diet induces aberrant hepatic  secretion in blunt snout bream by activating endoplasmic reticulum stress-associated IRE1/XBP1 pathway.</a></h1><p>This study was conducted to understand the effect of high- diet challenge on  transport and endoplasmic reticulum stress in blunt snout bream. Ninety fish (average weight: 41.84 ± 0.07 g) were randomly fed a control diet (6% ) or a high- diet (11% ) for 9 weeks. The growth performance and feed utilization efficiency were evaluated at the end of the trial. The liver samples of both groups were harvested for molecular analysis and histological evaluation. Compared to the Control group, the high- diet group showed no effects on either growth performance or energy intake in blunt snout bream. However, high- diet resulted in a massive accumulation of  and pathological structural alternations, and disrupted expression of  transport-related genes and endoplasmic reticulum stress in the liver of the fish. In vitro, after exposure of the isolated primary hepatocytes from blunt snout bream to , the cells showed increased intracellular TG accumulation, decreased VLDL secretion, which was attributed to altered expression levels of  transport-related genes through the activated IRE1/XBP1 signaling. The -induced detrimental effects were alleviated by co-incubating the cells with an IER1 inhibitor, 4μ8c. In conclusion, high- diet could lead to aberrant  secretion by activating the ER stress-associated IRE1/XBP1 pathway. Inhibiting the activity of IRE1 represents a promising target to rescue the side-effects of high- diet on the liver function of blunt snout bream.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

However, their use in bulk production, such as for the production of biodiesel, is still not cost effective, partly due to the possible poor use of desired substrates or poor robustness in the practical bioconversion process. We investigated the natural capacity of , a yeast already used in biotechnology, to store lipids under different conditions.The genotyping of seven strains showed the species to actually be composed of two different groups, one that (including the well-known strain LS3) could be reassigned to . We showed that, under nitrogen limitation, strains of both species can synthesize lipids to over 20% of their dry-cell weight during shake-flask cultivation in glucose or xylose medium for 96 h. In addition, organic acids were excreted into the medium. LS3, our best -producing strain, could also accumulate lipids from exogenous , up to 38.1 ± 1.6% of its dry-cell weight, and synthesize lipids from various sugar substrates, up to 36.6 ± 0.5% when growing in cellobiose. Both species, represented by LS3 and CBS 8244, could grow with little filamentation in the lipogenic medium from 28 to 45 °C and reached  titers ranging from 1.76 ± 0.28 to 3.08 ± 0.49 g/L in flasks. Under these conditions, the maximum bioconversion yield (  = 0.093 ± 0.017) was obtained with LS3 at 37 °C. The presence of genes for predicted subunits of an ATP citrate lyase in the genome of LS3 reinforces its oleaginous character. and  which are known to be xerotolerant and genetically-tractable, are promising biotechnological yeasts of the Saccharomycotina that could be further developed through genetic engineering for the production of microbial oil. To our knowledge, this is the first report of efficient  storage in yeast when cultivated at a temperature above 40 °C.

Therefore the aim of the present study was the development and validation of an in vitro multiculture model allowing to measure intestinal absorption using adipocytes as  sensors. We previously described (1) novel methods to study  induction of adipogenesis and lipogenesis and (2) a functional reconstituted intestinal barrier using human cell lines Caco-2/HT29-MTX (9:1). In the present study we develop a co-culture model with either adipocytes or hepatocytes as sensors for intestinal  absorption. This model was validated using  (OA) pre-absorbed onto the intestinal barrier. Optimized experimental conditions were obtained with partially differentiated 3T3L1-MBX adipocytes sensing up to 5 μM OA in solution or 40 μM OA pre-absorbed by Caco2/HT29-MTX intestinal barriers.  including glycemia and insulinemia greatly influenced the ability to  TG accumulation in adipocytes. By comparison AML12 hepatocytes found less sensitive to OA (up to 1 μM). The present study demonstrates a much better functionality for fatty  uptake and release in Caco2/HT29-MTX versus Caco-2 intestinal barriers. Taken together these results open new opportunities to study in vitro  transfer between intestinal barriers and either adipocytes or hepatocytes.

Furthermore, correlations between  accumulation and HAT activity for 22 representative natural food extracts (NExs) were evaluated.Non-histone protein acetylation increased following OPA treatment and the acetylation of histones H3K9, H4K8, and H4K16 was accelerated, accompanied by an increase in HAT activity. OPA-induced increases in the mRNA expression of lipogenic genes were down-regulated by C-646, a p300/CBP-specific inhibitor. Finally, we detected a positive correlation between HAT activity and  accumulation (Pearson's correlation coefficient = 0.604) using 22 NExs.Our results suggest that NExs have novel applications as nutraceutical agents with HAT inhibitor activity for the prevention and treatment of NAFLD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30987128>Capsaicin Targets Lipogenesis in HepG2 Cells Through AMPK Activation, AKT Inhibition and PPARs Regulation.</a></h1><p>Obesity, a major risk factor for chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes (T2D), represents a serious primary health problem worldwide. Dietary habits are of special interest to prevent and counteract the obesity and its associated metabolic disorders, including  steatosis. Capsaicin, a pungent compound of chili peppers, has been found to ameliorate diet-induced obesity in rodents and humans. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of capsaicin on hepatic lipogenesis and to delineate the underlying signaling pathways involved, using HepG2 cells as an experimental model. Cellular neutral lipids, stained with BODIPY493/503, were quantified by flow cytometry, and the protein expression and activity were determined by immunoblotting. Capsaicin reduced basal neutral  content in HepG2 cells, as well that induced by troglitazone or by . This effect of capsaicin was prevented by dorsomorphin and GW9662, pharmacological inhibitors of AMPK and PPARγ, respectively. In addition, capsaicin activated AMPK and inhibited the AKT/mTOR pathway, major regulators of hepatic lipogenesis. Furthermore, capsaicin blocked autophagy and increased PGC-1α protein.

The origins of disease can be traced back to early developmental stages of life. This has increased mortalities and continues to reduce life expectancies of individuals across the globe. The aim of this study was to investigate the sub-acute and long term effects of neonatal oral administration of oleanolic  and metformin on lipids (free fatty acids, FFAs) and genes associated with  and glucose transport using a neonatal rat experimental model. In the first study, seven days old pups were randomly grouped into control-distilled water (DW); oleanolic  (60 mg/kg), metformin (500 mg/kg), high fructose diet (20% /, HF), oleanolic  (OA) + high fructose diet (OA + HF), and Metformin + high fructose diet (MET + HF) groups. The pups were treated for 7 days, and then terminated on postnatal day (PD) 14. In the second study, rat pups were initially treated similarly to study 1 and weaned onto normal rat chow and plain drinking water on PD 21 till they reached adulthood (PD112). Tissue and blood samples were collected for further analyses. Measurement of the levels of free fatty acids (FFAs) was done using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was used to analyze the gene expression of , , , ,  and  in the skeletal muscle.

We aimed to explore fatty  (FA) processing in human villous placental explants from seven uncomplicated term singleton pregnancies delivered by elective cesarean section. Explants were treated with stable isotope-labeled palmitic  (13C-PA),  (13C-OA), or docosahexaenoic  (13C-DHA) for 3, 24, or 48 hours. Stable isotope-labeled lipids synthesized by placental explants from labeled FA were quantified, alongside endogenous unlabeled placental lipids, by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Labeled phosphatidylcholines (PCs), triacylglycerols (TAGs), and phosphatidylethanolamines were detected in explants, whereas labeled lysophosphatidylcholines were found in both explants and conditioned media. 13C-PA was primarily directed into PC synthesis (74% of 13C-PA-labeled lipids), whereas 13C-OA was directed almost equally into PC and TAG synthesis (45% and 53%, respectively, of 13C-OA-labeled lipids). 13C-DHA was only detectable in TAGs. TAGs demonstrated the highest isotopic enrichment for all 13C-FAs with 13C-OA-TAGs comprising >50% of total OA-TAGs (unlabeled and labeled), consistent with TAGs being a labile and accessible reservoir for FA storage. Variations in  incorporation were correlated to maternal glycemia and body mass index, suggesting that this experimental model could be used to investigate the effect of maternal factors on placental . We conclude that  metabolic partitioning of freshly imported FAs into labile and less labile  reservoirs in placenta is FA dependent. This process may partly mediate the physiological preferential transplacental transfer of particular FAs to the fetus, but may also be implicated in the fetoplacental pathophysiology of maternal metabolic dysfunction.Copyright © 2019 Endocrine Society.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30650453>Triterpenoids from Hibiscus sabdariffa L. with PPARδ/γ Dual Agonist Action: In Vivo, In Vitro and In Silico Studies.</a></h1><p> is a medicinal plant consumed as a diuretic and anti-obesity remedy.

Additionally, -amyrin and lupeol decreased  accumulation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and blood glucose in mice. Until now, -amyrin and lupeol have not been reported with activity on peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors.

We here intended to investigate the role of ApoA-1 in regeneration of small-for-size fatty liver graft and to explore the underlying mechanism.The association of ApoA-1 expression with liver regeneration was studied in rat liver transplantation models using small-for-size normal graft or small-for-size fatty graft. The direct role of ApoA-1 in liver regeneration was studied in mouse hepatectomy model in vivo and hepatocytes in vitro.Compared to small-for-size normal graft, decreased expression of ApoA-1 associated with delayed regeneration were detected in small-for-size fatty liver graft after transplantation. In functional study, the expression of ApoA-1 was decreased in hepatocytes with steatosis and was inversely associated with the concentration of . The ApoA-1 administration effectively attenuated hepatocytes steatosis and accelerated hepatocytes proliferation. In mouse model, ApoA-1 treatment promoted liver regeneration at day 2 after major hepatectomy. In addition, the treatment of ApoA-1 increased the expressions of PGC-1α and its target genes Tfam, Ucp2 and SDHB.ApoA-1 may accelerate regeneration of small-for-size fatty liver graft at day 2 after transplantation through regulating mitochondrial function. ApoA-1 may be the potential new therapy of promoting liver regeneration.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Although silibinin is used for the treatment of NASH in clinical, its effect on CFLAR-JNK pathway in NASH remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the effect of silibinin on CFLAR-JNK pathway in NASH models both  and . The  study was performed using male C57BL/6 mice fed with methionine- choline-deficient diet and simultaneously treated with silibinin for 6 weeks. The  study was performed by using mouse NCTC-1469 cells which were respectively pretreated with  plus palmitic , and adenovirus-down  for 24 h, then treated with silibinin for 24 h. After the drug treatment, the key indicators involved in CFLAR-JNK pathway including hepatic injury,  and oxidative stress were determined. Silibinin significantly activated CFLAR and inhibited the phosphorylation of JNK, up-regulated the mRNA expression of  and , reduced the activities of serum ALT and AST and the contents of hepatic TG, TC and MDA, increased the expression of NRF2 and the activities of CAT, GSH-Px and HO-1, and decreased the activities and expression of CYP2E1 and CYP4A . These effects were confirmed by the  experiments. Silibinin prevented NASH by regulating CFLAR-JNK pathway, and thereby on one hand promoting the -oxidation and efflux of fatty acids in liver to relieve  accumulation, and on the other hand inducing antioxidase activity (CAT, GSH-Px and HO-1) and inhibiting pro-oxidase activity (CYP2E1 and CYP4A) to relieve oxidative stress.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30359441>Proteomic analysis of Lactobacillus casei GCRL163 cell-free extracts reveals a SecB homolog and other biomarkers of prolonged heat stress.</a></h1><p>Prolonged heat stress is one of the harsh conditions Lactobacillus casei strains encounter as non-starter lactic  bacteria in dairy product manufacture. To understand the physiological and molecular mechanisms through which Lb. casei GCRL163 adapts to persistent elevated temperature, label-free quantitative proteomics of cell-free extracts was used to characterize the global responses of the strain cultured anaerobically in bioreactors at 30 to 45°C, pH 6.5, together with GC-MS for fatty  methyl ester analysis at different growth phases. At higher growth temperatures, repression of energy-consuming metabolic pathways, such as fatty , nucleotide and amino  biosynthesis, was observed, while PTS- and ABC-type transporter systems associated with uptake of nitrogen and carbon sources were up-regulated. Alkaline shock protein Asp23_2 was only detected at 45°C, expressed at high abundance, and presumptive α-L-fucosidase only at 40 and 45°C, with highly increased abundance (log2-fold change of 7) at 45°C. We identified a novel SecB homolog as a protein export chaperone putatively involved in posttranslational translocation systems, which was down-regulated as growth temperature increased and where the modelled 3D-structure shared architectural similarities with the Escherichia coli SecB protein. Membrane  analyses revealed temporal changes in fatty  composition, cyclization of  to cyclopropane and novel cyclopentenyl moieties, and reduced synthesis of vaccenic , at higher temperatures. An 18kDa α-crystallin domain, Hsp20 family heat shock protein was more highly up-regulated in response to heat stress compared to other molecular chaperones, suggesting this protein could be a useful biomarker of prolonged heat stress in Lb. casei GCRL163.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31315038>XBP-1 Remodels  to Extend Longevity.</a></h1><p>The endoplasmic reticulum unfolded protein response (UPR) is a cellular stress response that maintains homeostasis within the secretory pathway, regulates glucose and , and influences longevity. To ask whether this role in lifespan determination depends upon metabolic intermediaries, we metabotyped C. elegans expressing the active form of the UPR transcription factor XBP-1, XBP-1s, and found many metabolic changes. These included reduced levels of triglycerides and increased levels of  (OA), a monounsaturated fatty  associated with lifespan extension in C. elegans. Here, we show that constitutive XBP-1s expression increases the activity of lysosomal lipases and upregulates transcription of the Δ9 desaturase -6, which is required for the full lifespan extension induced by XBP-1s. Dietary OA supplementation increases the lifespan of wild-type, but not xbp-1s-expressing animals and enhances proteostasis. These results suggest that modulation of  by XBP-1s contributes to its downstream effects on protein homeostasis and longevity.Copyright © 2019 MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology.

Given  metabolic reprogramming is widely known as a hallmark of cancer and intimately linked with EGFR-stimulated cancer growth. Activation of EGFR signal pathway increased monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) and  key enzyme Stearoyl-CoA Desaturase 1 (SCD1) expression. However the correlation between EGFR-TKI resistance and  remains to be determined.In this study the differences in  synthesis between paired TKI-sensitive and TKI-resistant patient tissues and NSCLC cell lines were explored.  (OA, a kind of MUFA, the SCD1 enzymatic product) was used to simulate a high  metabolic environment and detected the affection on the cytotoxic effect of TKIs (Gefitinib and osimertinib) in cell lines with EGFR-activating mutations. (20S)-Protopanaxatriol (g-PPT), an aglycone of ginsenosides, has been reported to be an effective  inhibitor, was used to inhibit . Additionally, synergism in cytotoxic effects and signal pathway activation were evaluated using CCK-8 assays, Western blotting, flow cytometry, Edu assays, plate clone formation assays and immunofluorescence. Furthermore, two xenograft mouse models were used to verify the in vitro results.Gefitinib-resistant cells have higher  droplet content and SCD1 expression than Gefitinib-sensitive cells in both NSCLC cell lines and patient tissues. Additionally  (OA, a kind of MUFA, the SCD1 enzymatic product) abrogates the cytotoxic effect of both Gefitinib and osimertinib in cell lines with EGFR-activating mutations. As a reported effective  inhibitor, g-PPT significantly inhibited the expression of SCD1 in lung adenocarcinoma cells, and then down-regulated the content of intracellular  droplets. Combined treatment with Gefitinib and g-PPT reverses the resistance to Gefitinib and inhibits the activation of p-EGFR and the downstream signaling pathways.Our findings uncover a link between  metabolic reprogramming and EGFR-TKI resistance, confirmed that combination target both EGFR and abnormal  maybe a promising therapy for EGFR-TKI resistance and highlighting the possibility of monitoring  accumulation in tumors for predicting drug resistance.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31017523>Citrus peel flavonoids improve  by inhibiting miR-33 and miR-122 expression in HepG2 cells.</a></h1><p>Citrus plants are rich in flavonoids and beneficial for .

Both citrus peel flavonoid extracts (CPFE) and a mixture of their primary flavonoid compounds, namely, nobiletin, tangeretin and hesperidin, citrus flavonoid purity mixture (CFPM), were found to have -lowering effects on -induced  accumulation in HepG2 cells. The carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1α (CPT1α) gene was markedly increased, while the fatty  synthase (FAS) gene was significantly decreased by both CPFE and CFPM in -treated HepG2 cells. Flavonoid compounds from citrus peel suppressed miR-122 and miR-33 expression, which were induced by . Changes in miR-122 and miR-33 expression, which subsequently affect the expression of their target mRNAs FAS and CPT1α, are most likely the principal mechanisms leading to decreased  accumulation in HepG2 cells.

However, the effect of fatty acids on NETosis has not been clearly established. In this study, we focused on the NETosis-inducing ability of several  molecules. We extracted the  molecules present in Arabian Gulf catfish (, Val) skin gel, which has multiple therapeutic activities. Gas chromatography⁻mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis of the  fraction-3 from the gel with NETosis-inducing activity contained fatty acids including a furanoid F- (F6; 12,15-epoxy-13,14-dimethyleicosa-12,14-dienoic ) and common long-chain fatty acids such as palmitic  (PA; C16:0), palmitoleic  (PO; C16:1), stearic  (SA; C18:0), and  (OA; C18:1). Using pure molecules, we show that all of these fatty acids induce NETosis to different degrees in a dose-dependent fashion. Notably, F6 induces a unique form of NETosis that is rapid and induces reactive oxygen species (ROS) production by both NADPH oxidase (NOX) and mitochondria. F6 also induces citrullination of histone. By contrast, the common fatty acids (PA, PO, SA, and OA) only induce NOX-dependent NETosis. The activation of the kinases such as ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) and JNK (c-Jun N-terminal kinase) is important for long-chain fatty -induced NETosis, whereas, in F--induced NETosis, Akt is additionally needed. Nevertheless, NETosis induced by all of these compounds requires the final chromatin decondensation step of transcriptional firing. These findings are useful for understanding F-- and other fatty -induced NETosis and to establish the active ingredients with therapeutic potential for regulating diseases involving NET formation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30573812>A novel ASBT inhibitor, IMB17-15, repressed nonalcoholic fatty liver disease development in high- diet-fed Syrian golden hamsters.</a></h1><p>The manipulation of bile  (BA) homeostasis by blocking the ileal apical Na-dependent bile salt transporter (ASBT/SLC10A2) may have therapeutic effects in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. We developed a novel ASBT inhibitor, an N-(3,4-o-dichlorophenyl)-2-(3-trifluoromethoxy) benzamide derivative referred to as IMB17-15, and investigated its therapeutic effects and the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects. Syrian golden hamsters were challenged with high- diet (HFD) to induce NAFLD and were subsequently administered 400 mg/kg IMB17-15 by gavage daily for 21 days. Serum, liver, and fecal samples were collected for further analysis. Plasma concentration-time profiles of IMB17-15 were also constructed. The human hepatocyte cell line HL-7702 was treated with  (OA) with or without IMB17-15. Western blotting and real-time PCR were used to study the molecular mechanisms of IMB17-15. We found that IMB17-15 inhibited ASBT and subsequently suppressed ileal farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and FXR-activated fibroblast growth factor15/19 (FGF15/19) expression, which reduced the hepatic phosphorylated extracellular regulated protein kinase (ERK) and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) levels and upregulated the cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) activity. Additionally, IMB17-15 stimulated adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPKα) phosphorylation and enhanced peroxisome proliferator activated receptor α (PPARα) expression and thus promoted triglyceride (TG) oxidation and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c)  through an ASBT-independent mechanism. In conclusion, a novel ASBT inhibitor known as IMB17-15 protected hamsters against HFD-induced NFALD by manipulating BA and  homeostasis. IMB17-15 also reduced  deposition in human hepatic cell lines, indicating that it may be useful as a therapy for NAFLD patients.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30547786>Genomics of -laden human hepatocyte cultures enables drug target screening for the treatment of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.</a></h1><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a major health burden in need for new medication. To identify potential drug targets a genomic study was performed in -laden primary human hepatocyte (PHH) and human hepatoma cell cultures.PHH, HuH7 and HepG2 hepatoma cell cultures were treated with lipids and/or TNFα. Intracellular  load was quantified with the ORO assay. The Affymetrix HG-U133+ array system was employed to perform transcriptome analysis. The  droplet (LD) growth and fusion was determined by fluorescence microscopy. LD associated proteins were imaged by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy and confirmed by Western immunoblotting. Bioinformatics defined perturbed metabolic pathways.Whole genome expression profiling identified 227, 1031 and 571 significant regulated genes. Likewise, the combined  and TNFα treatment of PHH, HuH7 and HepG2 cell cultures revealed 154, 1238 and 278 differentially expressed genes. Although genomic responses differed among in-vitro systems, commonalities were ascertained by filtering the data for LD associated gene regulations. Among others the LD-growth and fusion associated cell death inducing DFFA like effector C (CIDEC), perilipins (PLIN2, PLIN3), the synaptosome-associated-protein 23 and the vesicle associated membrane protein 3 were strongly up-regulated. Likewise, the PPAR targets pyruvate-dehydrogenase-kinase-4 and angiopoietin-like-4 were up-regulated as was hypoxia-inducible  droplet-associated (HILPDA), flotilin and FGF21. Their inhibition ameliorates triglyceride and cholesterol accumulation. TNFα treatment elicited strong induction of the chemokine CXCL8, the kinases MAP3K8, MAP4K4 and negative regulators of cytokine signaling, i.e. SOCS2&SOCS3. Live cell imaging of DsRED calreticulin plasmid transfected HuH7 cells permitted an assessment of LD growth and fusion and confocal immunofluorescence microscopy evidenced induced LD-associated PLIN2, CIDEC, HIF1α, HILPDA, JAK1, PDK4 and ROCK2 expression. Notwithstanding, CPT1A protein was repressed to protect mitochondria from  overload. Pharmacological inhibition of the GTPase-dynamin and the fatty  transporter-2 reduced  uptake by 28.5 and 35%, respectively. Finally, a comparisons of in-vitro/NAFLD patient biopsy findings confirmed common gene regulations thus demonstrating clinical relevance.The genomics of -laden hepatocytes revealed LD-associated gene regulations and perturbed metabolic pathways.

Previous studies have identified the presence of primary fatty acids in its elaiosomes and seeds. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying fatty  biosynthesis in elaiosomes remain unknown.In order to gain a comprehensive transcriptional profile of the elaiosomes and seeds of , and understand the expression patterns of genes associated with fatty  biosynthesis, four different developmental stages, including the flower-bud (Ch01), flowering (Ch02), young seed (Ch03), and mature seed (Ch04) stages, were chosen to perform whole-transcriptome profiling through the RNA-seq technology (Illumina NGS sequencing).A total of 63,064 unigenes were generated from 12 libraries. Of these, 7,323, 258, and 11,540 unigenes were annotated with 25 Cluster of Orthologous Groups, 43 Gene Ontology terms, and 373 Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways, respectively. In addition, 322 genes were involved in  transport and , and 508 genes were involved in the  pathways. A total of 41 significantly differentially expressed genes (DEGs) involved in the  pathways were identified, most of which were upregulated in Ch03 compared to Ch02, indicating that fatty  biosynthesis primarily occurs during the flowering to the young seed stages. Of the DEGs, acyl-ACP thioesterases, acyl carrier protein desaturase (), and malonyl CoA-ACP transacylase were involved in palmitic  synthesis; stearoyl-CoA desaturase and  were involved in  synthesis, and acyl- omega-6 desaturase was involved in linoleic  synthesis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30639394>The Differentiation of Spinal Cord Motor Neurons is Associated with Changes of the Mitochondrial Phospholipid Cardiolipin.</a></h1><p>Motor neuron damage caused by diseases, traumatic insults or de-afferentation of the spinal cord is often incurable due to the poor intrinsic regenerative capacity. Moreover, regenerated peripheral nerves often do not reach normal functionality. Here, we investigated cardiolipin in the process of neuro-differentiation, since cardiolipin is closely linked to the mitochondrial energy supply in cells. The NSC-34 hybrid cell line, produced by fusing neuroblastoma cells with primary spinal cord motor neurons, was used, since it shares several morphological and physiological characteristics with mature primary motor neurons. Their neuro-differentiation was supported by switching from normal to differentiation medium or by fatty  supplementation. Differentiation was evaluated by measuring neurite-sprouting parameters and PPARα expression. Cellular fatty  distribution was analyzed to indicate changes in  during differentiation. Cardiolipin was characterized by acyl-chain composition and the distribution of molecular cardiolipin species. Both, the switch from normal to differentiation medium as well as the administration of palmitic and  promoted neuro-differentiation. Stimulated differentiation was accompanied by changes in cardiolipin content and composition. The positive correlation between neuro-differentiation and concentration of those molecular cardiolipin species containing palmitic and  implied a link between differentiation of NSC-34 cells and cardiolipin . We further demonstrated the impact of cellular , and particularly cardiolipin , during and NSC-34 neuritogenesis. Thus, cardiolipin may represent a new therapeutic target for axon regeneration after peripheral nerve injuries or when axon sprouting is required to compensate for motor neuron loss in response to aging and/or disease.Copyright © 2019 IBRO.

GW7647 is a potent PPARα agonist that must reach the nucleus to activate this receptor. In cells expressing human fatty -binding protein 1 (FABP1), GW7647 treatment increases FABP1's nuclear localization and potentiates GW7647-mediated PPARα activation; GW7647 is less effective in cells that do not express FABP1. To elucidate the underlying mechanism, here we substituted residues in FABP1 known to dictate  signaling by other intracellular -binding proteins. Substitutions of Lys-20 and Lys-31 to Ala in the FABP1 helical cap affected neither its nuclear localization nor PPARα activation. In contrast, Ala substitution of Lys-57, Glu-77, and Lys-96, located in the loops adjacent to the ligand-binding portal region, abolished both FABP1 nuclear localization and GW7647-induced PPARα activation but had little effect on GW7647-FABP1 binding affinity. Using solution NMR spectroscopy, we determined the WT FABP1 structure and analyzed the dynamics in the apo and GW7647-bound structures of both the WT and the K57A/E77A/K96A triple mutant. We found that GW7647 binding causes little change in the FABP1 backbone, but solvent exposes several residues in the loops around the portal region, including Lys-57, Glu-77, and Lys-96. These residues also become more solvent-exposed upon binding of FABP1 with the endogenous PPARα agonist . Together with previous observations, our findings suggest that GW7647 binding stabilizes a FABP1 conformation that promotes its interaction with PPARα. We conclude that full PPARα agonist activity of GW7647 requires FABP1-dependent transport and nuclear localization processes.© 2019 Patil et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31336948>Hypoxia Modulates Effects of Fatty Acids on NES2Y Human Pancreatic β-cells.</a></h1><p>Saturated fatty acids (FAs) induce apoptosis in the human pancreatic NES2Y β-cell line while unsaturated FAs have nearly no detrimental effect. Moreover, unsaturated FAs are capable of inhibiting the pro-apoptotic effect of saturated FAs. Hypoxia is also known to have deleterious effects on β-cells function and viability. In the present study, we have tested the modulatory effect of hypoxia on the effect of FAs on the growth and viability of the human pancreatic NES2Y β-cells. This study represents the first study testing hypoxia effect on effects of FAs in pancreatic β-cells as well as in other cell types. We showed that hypoxia increased the pro-apoptotic effect of saturated stearic  (SA). Endoplasmic reticulum stress signaling seemed to be involved while redistribution of FA transporters fatty  translocase/cluster of differentiation 36 (/CD36) and fatty -binding protein (FABP) do not seem to be involved in this effect. Hypoxia also strongly decreased the protective effect of unsaturated  (OA) against the pro-apoptotic effect of SA. Thus, in the presence of hypoxia, OA was unable to save SA-treated β-cells from apoptosis induction. Hypoxia itself had only a weak detrimental effect on NES2Y cells.

The liver tissue expression levels of RIP3, microsomal triglyceride transfer protein, protein disulfide isomerase, apolipoprotein-B, X-box binding protein-1, sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c, fatty  synthase, cluster of differentiation-36, diglyceride acyltransferase, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and interleukin-6 were assessed.  treated primary hepatocytes from WT and RIP3KO mice were stained with Nile red. The expression of inflammatory cytokines, including chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand (CXCL) 1, CXCL2, and TNF-α, in monocytes was evaluated.RIP3KO HF diet fed mice showed a significant gain in body weight, and liver weight, liver to body weight ratio, and liver triglycerides were increased in HF diet fed RIP3KO mice compared to HF diet fed WT mice. RIP3KO primary hepatocytes also had increased intracellular  droplets compared to WT primary hepatocytes after  treatment. RIP3 overexpression decreased hepatic  content. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis showed that the expression of very-low-density lipoproteins secretion markers (microsomal triglyceride transfer protein, protein disulfide isomerase, and apolipoprotein-B) was significantly suppressed in RIP3KO mice.

The mechanisms by which the risk variants cause kidney damage, although not well-understood, are believed to involve injury to glomerular podocytes. The intracellular localization and function of APOL1 in podocytes remain unclear, with recent studies suggesting possible roles in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), mitochondria, endosomes, lysosomes, and autophagosomes. Here, we demonstrate that APOL1 also localizes to intracellular  droplets (LDs). While a large fraction of risk variant APOL1 (G1 and G2) localizes to the ER, a significant proportion of wild-type APOL1 (G0) localizes to LDs. APOL1 transiently interacts with numerous organelles, including the ER, mitochondria, and endosomes. Treatment of cells that promote LD formation with  shifted the localization of G1 and G2 from the ER to LDs, with accompanying reduction of autophagic flux and cytotoxicity. Coexpression of G0 APOL1 with risk variant APOL1 enabled recruitment of G1 and G2 from the ER to LDs, accompanied by reduced cell death. The ability of G0 APOL1 to recruit risk variant APOL1 to LDs may help explain the recessive pattern of kidney disease inheritance. These studies establish APOL1 as a bona fide LD-associated protein, and reveal that recruitment of risk variant APOL1 to LDs reduces cell toxicity, autophagic flux, and cell death. Thus, interventions that divert APOL1 risk variants to LDs may serve as a novel therapeutic strategy to alleviate their cytotoxic effects.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30814550>Serum Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids Correlate with Serum Cytokines and Clinical Disease Activity in Crohn's Disease.</a></h1><p>Crohn's disease (CD) has been associated with an increased consumption of n-6 polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA), while greater intake of n-3 PUFA has been associated with a reduced risk.

Concentrations of cellular palmitoleic  (C16:1) and  (C18:1) were decreased (1.12 ± 0.05 vs 1.69 ± 0.11% and 15.70 ± 0.44 vs 24.97 ± 0.82%, respectively, P < 0.01), whereas those of linoleic  (C18:2) were increased (5.00 ± 0.14 vs 3.81 ± 0.25%, P < 0.05); the desaturation indices of C16 and C18 were decreased in response to t10c12-CLA treatment (6.90 ± 0.05 vs 8.00 ± 0.30% and 61.41 ± 0.65 vs 67.73 ± 1.33%, respectively, P < 0.05). A luciferase-activity assay indicated that deletion of the sterol-response-element (SRE) site and the nuclear-factor (NF-Y) site in the SCD1-promoter region (-511/+65 bp) suppressed the regulatory effect of t10c12-CLA. Overexpression of SREBF1 partly counteracted the inhibitory effect of t10c12-CLA on de novo fatty  synthesis. Overall, t10c12-CLA causes an inhibition of fatty  synthesis and desaturation and regulates SCD1 expression by affecting the binding of SREBP1 protein to the SRE and NF-Y sites.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30519364> is a novel hypothalamic gene upregulated by a high- diet and leptin in mice.</a></h1><p>Energy homeostasis is regulated by the hypothalamus but fails when animals are fed a high- diet (HFD), and leptin insensitivity and obesity develops. To elucidate the possible mechanisms underlying these effects, a microarray-based transcriptomics approach was used to identify novel genes regulated by HFD and leptin in the mouse hypothalamus.Mouse global array data identified  as a novel gene highly upregulated by both a HFD and leptin challenge. In situ hybridisation showed  expression upregulation by HFD and leptin in all major hypothalamic nuclei in agreement with transcriptomic gene expression data. Immunohistochemistry and studies in the hypothalamic clonal neuronal cell line, mHypoE-N42 (N42), confirmed that alpha 1-antichymotrypsin (αAC), the protein encoded by , is localised to neurons and revealed that it is secreted into the media.  expression in N42 neurons is upregulated by palmitic  and by leptin, together with  and , and all three genes are downregulated by the anti-inflammatory monounsaturated , . Additionally, palmitate upregulation of  in N42 neurons is blocked by the NFκB inhibitor, BAY11, and the upregulation of  expression in the hypothalamus by HFD is blunted in IL-1 receptor 1 knockout (  ) mice.These data demonstrate that  expression is implicated in nutritionally mediated hypothalamic inflammation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30538802>Omega-9 , the Main Compound of Olive Oil, Mitigates Inflammation during Experimental Sepsis.</a></h1><p>The Mediterranean diet, rich in olive oil, is beneficial, reducing the risk of cardiovascular diseases and cancer. Olive oil is mostly composed of the monounsaturated fatty  omega-9. We showed omega-9 protects septic mice modulating . Sepsis is initiated by the host response to infection with organ damage, increased plasma free fatty acids, high levels of cortisol, massive cytokine production, leukocyte activation, and endothelial dysfunction. We aimed to analyze the effect of omega-9 supplementation on corticosteroid unbalance, inflammation, bacterial elimination, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) gamma expression, an omega-9 receptor and inflammatory modulator. We treated mice for 14 days with omega-9 and induced sepsis by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). We measured systemic corticosterone levels, cytokine production, leukocyte and bacterial counts in the peritoneum, and the expression of PPAR gamma in both liver and adipose tissues during experimental sepsis. We further studied omega-9 effects on leukocyte rolling in mouse cremaster muscle-inflamed postcapillary venules and in the cerebral microcirculation of septic mice. Here, we demonstrate that omega-9 treatment is associated with increased levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 and decreased levels of the proinflammatory cytokines TNF- and IL-1 in peritoneal lavage fluid of mice with sepsis. Omega-9 treatment also decreased systemic corticosterone levels. Neutrophil migration from circulation to the peritoneal cavity and leukocyte rolling on the endothelium were decreased by omega-9 treatment. Omega-9 also decreased bacterial load in the peritoneal lavage and restored liver and adipose tissue PPAR gamma expression in septic animals. Our data suggest a beneficial anti-inflammatory role of omega-9 in sepsis, mitigating leukocyte rolling and leukocyte influx, balancing cytokine production, and controlling bacterial growth possibly through a PPAR gamma expression-dependent mechanism. The significant reduction of inflammation detected after omega-9 enteral injection can further contribute to the already known beneficial properties facilitated by unsaturated fatty -enriched diets.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31120956>Ulmus macrocarpa Hance modulates  in hyperlipidemia via activation of AMPK pathway.</a></h1><p>Ulmus macrocarpa Hance as an oriental medicinal plant has shown enormous potential for the treatment of several metabolic disorders in Korea. Hyperlipidemia, which is characterized by the excess accumulation of  contents in the bloodstream, may lead to several cardiovascular diseases. Therefore, in this study, anti-hyperlipidemic potential of U. macrocarpa water extract (UME) was examined in vitro and in vivo using HepG2 cells and experimental rats, respectively. The hyperlipidemia in experimental rats was induced by the high-cholesterol diet (HCD) followed by oral administration of various concentrations (25, 50 and 100 mg/kg) of UME for 6 weeks. As a result, the UME significantly improved the biochemical parameters such as increased the level of triglyceride, total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol as well as reduced the high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in the HCD-fed rats. In addition, UME also prevented  accumulation through regulating AMPK activity and  proteins (ACC, SREBP1 and HMGCR) in the HCD-fed rats as compared to the controls. Moreover, similar pattern of gene expression levels was confirmed in  (OA)-treated HepG2 cells. Taken together, our results indicate that UME prevents hyperlipidemia via activating the AMPK pathway and regulates . Thus, based on the above findings, it is estimated that UME could be a potential therapeutic agent for preventing the hyperlipidemia.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30603757>Gene expression profile-based drug screen identifies SAHA as a novel treatment for NAFLD.</a></h1><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common chronic liver disease worldwide. Being part of the metabolic syndrome, NAFLD is characterized by the deposition of triglycerides (TGs) as  droplets in the cytoplasm of hepatic cells. Recently, the rapid development of high-throughput genome analysis technologies provided opportunities to screen for new drugs for NAFLD. In this study, we screened for potential drugs based on the gene expression profiles of 73 compounds and identified histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors as a novel treatment for the accumulation of lipids in hepatocytes. In the subsequent analysis and experiments, we discovered that SAHA inhibited the fatty  and  pathways in hepatic cells and induced a significant deficiency of  accumulation in HepG2 and SMMC-7721 cells. Furthermore, SAHA inhibited  synthesis in hepatic cells by directly suppressing the expression of DGAT2. Hence, our study provides a novel method to screen for effective drugs for liver diseases and identifies SAHA as a potent treatment for NAFLD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31667852>Regulation mechanism of silkworm pupa oil PUFAs on cholesterol  in hepatic cell L-02.</a></h1><p>Silkworm Pupa Oil Polyunsaturated Fatty  (SPO PUFAs) has confirmed to have cholesterol-lowering function. Currently, SPO PUFAs and its main component α-Linolenic  (ALA) on regulation of cholesterol  was investigated.  denatured cell model was constructed by  for  accumulation, cholesterol  and transformation. In addition, real-time PCR and western-blot were used to analyze the expression levels of related the genes and proteins for cholesterol efflux regulation mechanism investigation. The data indicated that SPO PUFAs and ALA dose-dependently decreased intracellular total cholesterol (TC), enhanced total bile  (TBA). Furthermore, SPO PUFAs and ALA could promote cholesterol removal through enhancing bile  secretion and up-regulating genes LXRα, PPARγ, ABCA1, ABCG1, and CYP7A1, which were regulated by LXRα/PPARγ-ABCA1/ABCG1-CYP7A1 nuclear receptor signal pathways.

However, the fatty  (FA) profile in red blood cells (RBC) from patients with liver fibrosis remains unexplored. Thus, the goal of this study was to evaluate the fatty  profile in RBC, dietary  intake and insulin resistance indicators in patients with NAFLD, according to the degree of hepatic fibrosis. Using elastography, patients were classified with ( = 52) and without ( = 37) advanced liver fibrosis. The fatty  profile in RBC was analyzed using gas chromatography and the  intake was evaluated through a 24-h dietary recall. Subjects with advanced liver fibrosis had higher levels of palmitic, stearic and  and total monounsaturated fatty  (MUFA) and insulin ( < 0.05), and lower levels of elongase very long chain fatty acids protein-6 and the delta-5-desaturase enzymatic activity ( < 0.05).

However, the underlying mechanisms by which PS modulates  are largely unknown. To address this question, serial doses of PS extract (PSE) were added to 3T3-L1 cells during adipocyte differentiation. PSE (25 µg/mL) significantly attenuated adipogenesis by inhibiting  accumulation in addition to reducing the level of adipogenic protein and gene expression with the activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Other adipocyte cell models such as mouse embryonic fibroblasts C3H10T1/2 and primary adipocytes also confirmed the anti-adipogenic properties of PSE. Next, we investigated whether PSE attenuated  accumulation in mature adipocytes. We found that PSE significantly suppressed lipogenic gene expression, while fatty  (FA) oxidation genes were upregulated. Augmentation of FA oxidation by PSE in mature 3T3-L1 adipocytes was confirmed via a radiolabeled-FA oxidation rate experiment by measuring the conversion of [³H]- (OA) to [³H]-H₂O. Furthermore, PSE enhanced the mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate (OCR), especially maximal respiration, and beige adipocyte formation in adipocytes. In summary, PSE was effective in reducing  accumulation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes through mitochondrial fatty  oxidation involved in AMPK and mitochondrial activation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31374159>pH effects on the  and fatty acids accumulation in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.</a></h1><p>pH variations influence the delivery of essential nutrients and CO solubility, which impact algae . In this study the microalgal growth and chlorophyll, , and fatty acids content; along with the expression of some genes implicated in the biosynthesis of lipids were examined in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii subjected to pH values of 7.0, 7.8, and 8.5. At pH 7.8 an increase in cell growth was observed with a significant accumulation of chlorophyll (1.75-fold) when compared with growth at pH 7, while at pH 8.5 a sharp decrease in both parameters was observed when compared with the other pH values tested.  content increased 3.0 (14.81% of dry cell weight, dcw) and 2.3 times (11.43% dcw) at pH 7.8 and 8.5, respectively, when compared with the experiment at pH 7 (4.97% dcw). The compositions of major fatty acids in the strains growing at pH 7.0, 7.8, or 8.5 were 25.7, 28.0, and 32.1% for palmitic ; 17.3, 14.7, and 25.7% for ; and 9.8, 12.1, and 4.6% for linoleic ; respectively. qRT-PCR analysis showed that the transcripts of ß-carboxyltransferase, Acyl carrier protein 1, acyl-ACP thiolase 1, acyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase, and diacylglycerol acyl transferase isoform 3 were significantly induced at pH 7.8 when compared with the other two pH conditions. These results indicate that the induction of genes implicated in the early and final steps of  biosynthesis contributes to their accumulation in the stationary phase. Our research suggests that a pH of 7.8 might be ideal to maximize growth and  accumulation.© 2019 American Institute of Chemical Engineers.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30864855>Fermented  Extract Ameliorates Hepatosteatosis via Activation of Fatty  Oxidation.</a></h1><p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is a progressive disease involving the accumulation of  droplets in the liver. In this study, we investigated the anti-hepatosteatosis effects of fermented  extract (CME) in AML-12 hepatocytes. Although the levels of adenosine and cordycepin were reduced in the extracts of CM grown on germinated soybean (GSCE) and fermented CM grown on germinated soybean (GSC) by  ON188 (ON188E), the expression of fatty  oxidation (FAO) genes were upregulated only by GSC-ON188E treatment in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, a lipogenic gene, stearoyl Coenzyme A desaturase 1, was downregulated by ON188E. Formation of intracellular  droplets by the addition of  was reduced by ON188E to levels observed in WY14643-treated cells. When cells were treated with ON188E, sphingosine kinase 2 mainly responsible for hepatic sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) synthesis was upregulated and S1P was elevated. Collectively, the fermented GSC extract activates FAO through elevation of S1P synthesis and has potential as a therapeutic for hepatosteatosis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30593897>Fatty acids uptake and oxidation are increased in the liver of rats with adjuvant-induced arthritis.</a></h1><p>Severe rheumatoid cachexia is associated with pronounced loss of muscle and  mass in patients with advanced rheumatoid arthritis. This condition is associated with dyslipidemia and predisposition to cardiovascular diseases. Circulating levels of triglycerides (TG) and free fatty acids (FFA) have not yet been consistently defined in severe arthritis. Similarly, the  of these lipids in the arthritic liver has not yet been clarified. Aiming at filling these gaps this study presents a characterization of the circulating  profile and of the fatty acids uptake and  in perfused livers of rats with adjuvant-induced arthritis. The levels of TG and total cholesterol were reduced in both serum (10-20%) and liver (20-35%) of arthritic rats. The levels of circulating FFA were 40% higher in arthritic rats, possibly in consequence of cytokine-induced adipose tissue lipolysis. Hepatic uptake and oxidation of palmitic and  acids was higher in arthritic livers. The phenomenon results possibly from a more oxidized state of the arthritic liver. Indeed, NADPH/NADP and NADH/NAD ratios were 30% lower in arthritic livers, which additionally presented higher activities of the citric  cycle driven by both endogenous and exogenous FFA. The lower levels of circulating and hepatic TG possibly are caused by an increased oxidation associated to a reduced synthesis of fatty acids in arthritic livers. These results reveal that the  hepatic  in arthritic rats presents a strong catabolic tendency, a condition that should contribute to the marked cachexia described for arthritic rats and possibly for the severe rheumatoid arthritis.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Herein, we report that TSPO (translocator protein), an outer mitochondrial protein, is highly enriched in tanycytes and regulates homeostatic responses to nutrient excess as a potential target for an effective intervention in obesity. Administration of a TSPO ligand, PK11195, into the 3V, and tanycyte-specific deletion of  reduced food intake and elevated energy expenditure, leading to negative energy balance in a high- diet challenge. Ablation of tanycytic  elicited AMPK-dependent lipophagy, breaking down  droplets into free fatty acids, thereby elevating ATP in a  stimulus. Our findings suggest that tanycytic TSPO affects systemic energy balance through macroautophagy/autophagy-regulated , and highlight the physiological significance of TSPO in hypothalamic  sensing and bioenergetics in response to overnutrition.  3V: 3 ventricle; ACAC: acetyl-Coenzyme A carboxylase; AGRP: agouti related neuropeptide; AIF1/IBA1: allograft inflammatory factor 1; AMPK: AMP-activated protein kinase; ARC: arcuate nucleus; Atg: autophagy related; Bafilo: bafilomycin A; CAMKK2: calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase 2, beta; CCCP: carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone; CNS: central nervous system; COX4I1: cytochrome c oxidase subunit 4I1; FFA: free fatty ; GFAP: glial fibrillary acidic protein; HFD: high- diet; ICV: intracerebroventricular; LAMP2: lysosomal-associated membrane protein 2; LD:  droplet; MAP1LC3B/LC3B: microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 beta; MBH: mediobasal hypothalamus; ME: median eminence; MEF: mouse embryonic fibroblast; NCD: normal chow diet; NEFM/NFM: neurofilament medium; NPY: neuropeptide Y; OL: ; POMC: pro-opiomelanocortin-alpha; PRKN/Parkin: parkin RBR E3 ubiquitin protein ligase; : retina and anterior neural fold homeobox; RBFOX3/NeuN: RNA binding protein, fox-1 homolog (C. elegans) 3; RER: respiratory exchange ratio; siRNA: small interfering RNA; SQSTM1: sequestosome 1; TG: triglyceride; TSPO: translocator protein; ULK1: unc-51 like kinase 1; VCO: carbon dioxide production; VMH: ventromedial hypothalamus; VO: oxygen consumption.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30717278>Human Tongue Electrophysiological Response to  and Its Associations with PROP Taster Status and the  Polymorphism ().</a></h1><p>The perception of  varies among individuals and has also been associated with  polymorphism and genetic ability to perceive oral marker 6-n-propylthiouracil (PROP).

We report for the first time, in humans and in vivo, the kinetics of placental FA transfer in normo-weight and in normolipemic obese pregnant women using stable isotopes. The administration of different tracer FA with similar behaviour to the mother at different time points allows the collection of kinetic information on materno-fetal transfer of FA despite only one sample of placenta and cord can be collected per subject. Computational modelling showed a good fit to the data when considering all maternal plasma  classes but not when based only on non-esterified FA. The novel approach using multiple tracer FA administration combined with computational modelling shows a consistent time course of placental tracer FA and predicted total FA accumulation.We analyse for the first time the in vivo materno-fetal kinetic transfer of fatty acids (FA) labelled with stable isotopes in control and obese (OB) pregnant women. Labelled FA with a similar  (stearic :  C-SA; palmitic :  C-PA; :  C-OA) were orally administered at -4 h, -8 h and -12 h, respectively prior to elective caesarean section to 10 pregnant women with a body mass index >30 (OB) and 10 with a body mass index in the range 20-25 (NW). Placenta, venous and arterial cord blood were collected obtaining a wide range of FA enrichments. A combined experimental and computational modelling analysis was applied. FA fractional synthesis rate (FSR) in placenta was 11-12% h . No differences were observed between NW and normo-lipidemic OB. It was not possible to estimate FA FSR in cord blood with this oral bolus dose approach. Computational modelling demonstrated a good fit to the data when all maternal plasma  classes were included but not with modelling based only on the non-esterified FA fraction. The estimated materno-fetal  C-FA transfer was ∼1%. In conclusion, our approach using multiple  C-FA tracers allowed us to estimated FSR in placental/maternal plasma but not in fetal/maternal compartments. Computational modelling showed a consistent time course of placental  C-FA transfer and predicted total fetal FA accumulation during the experiment. We conclude that, in addition to non-esterified FA fraction in the maternal circulation, maternal plasma very low-density lipoprotein and other lipoproteins are important contributors to placental FA transfer to the fetus.© 2019 The Authors.

In the current study, we investigated the effects of PCW extract on hepatic steatosis under in vitro and in vivo conditions, and elucidated the underlying mechanisms. In this study, a mixture of HepG2 cells treated with free fatty  (FFA)-palmitic and -and high- diet (HFD)-fed obese mice were used; in this background, the triglyceride (TG) levels in HepG2 cells and mice liver were measured, and the expression levels of genes associated with lipogenesis, fatty  oxidation, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and autophagy were determined. Treatment of HepG2 cells with FFA enhanced intracellular TG levels in HepG2 cells, but co-treatment with PCW significantly attenuated the TG levels. Notably, PCW significantly enhanced the phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), and sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c) in FFA-treated HepG2 cells. PCW downregulated the expression of lipogenesis-related genes, but upregulated the expression of genes associated with fatty  oxidation. Further, PCW inhibited FFA-induced expression of ER stress markers and induced autophagy proteins. However, inhibition of AMPK significantly attenuated the beneficial effects of PCW in HepG2 cells. Moreover, PCW efficiently decreased HFD-induced hepatic TG accumulation in vivo and increased the phosphorylation of hepatic AMPK. Three compounds present in PCW including poricoic , pachymic , and ergosterol, significantly decreased FFA-induced increase in intracellular TG levels, consistent with increased AMPK phosphorylation, suggesting that poricoic , pachymic , and ergosterol are responsible for PCW-mediated amelioration of hepatic steatosis. Taken together, these results demonstrated that PCW ameliorates hepatic steatosis through the regulation of , inhibition of ER stress, and activation of autophagy in an AMPK-dependent manner. This suggested that PCW can be potentially used for the treatment of hepatic steatosis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30531159>A role for scavenger receptor B1 as a captor of specific fatty acids in taste buds of circumvallate papillae.</a></h1><p>Class B scavenger receptor family members, scavenger receptor B1 (SR-B1) and cluster of differentiation 36 (CD36), are broadly expressed cell-surface proteins, both of which are believed to serve as multifaceted players in  and lipoprotein  in mammals. Because of its presence in the apical part of taste receptor cells within circumvallate taste buds and its ability to recognise long-chain fatty acids, CD36 has been believed to participate in the sensing of the  species within the oral cavity. However, there have been no attempts to address whether SR-B1 has such a role to date. In this study, by reverse transcription- polymerase chain reaction analysis, we detected SR-B1 mRNA in a total RNA sample isolated from the circumvallate papillae of mouse tongue. Immunohistochemical analysis of tongue sections from the animals revealed the expression of SR-B1 protein in a population of taste bud cells of circumvallate papillae. In addition, the pattern of staining in the papillae for SR-B1 agreed closely with that for CD36 in double immunostaining analysis. We performed a cell-free in-vitro assay utilising a peptide mimic of SR-B1 and provided evidence that the receptor could recognise certain of the unsaturated long-chain fatty acids such as .

It is known that HPS plays an important role in the development of nonalcoholic fatty liver diseases (NAFLD). Fatty acids, such as  (OLA), exhibit the ability to activate the signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (STAT3), and the binding site of STAT3 is found in the promoter region of HPS. However, the regulation of HPS by fatty acids is still obscure. To clarify the regulation of HPS, we detected the expression of HPS by western blots. In addition, a hepatic steatosis cell culture model was established by treatment of different fatty acids, including linoleic  (LNA), , palmitic , and stearic . The intracellular  accumulation was confirmed by oil red O staining. Blocking of STAT3 activity was achieved by the pretreatment of the STAT3 inhibitor, stattic. We found that activation of STAT3 by interleukin-6 (IL-6) was mediated in the regulation of HPS expression. Treatment of unsaturated fatty acids significantly induced intracellular  accumulation in HepG2 cells. Moreover, the expressions of HPS were increased in unsaturated fatty -treated HepG2 cells, as compared with saturated fatty -treated groups. Also, the expression of HPS induced by OLA was blocked by the inhibition of STAT3 activity. Furthermore, we found that deletion of HPS by small interfering ribonucleic  transfection decreased the protective effect of OLA on cell viability. Taken together, we provided evidence that STAT3 plays an important role in the regulation of OLA-induced HPS expression and the increased HPS may further participate in the development of NAFLD. In addition, the increase of HPS might be involved in the protective effect of OLA on cell viability.© 2018 AOCS.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30460114>Modulatory effect of linoleic and  on cell proliferation and  gene expressions in primary bovine satellite cells.</a></h1><p>This study was performed to elucidate the effects of linoleic  (LA),  (OA) and their combination (LA + OA) on cell proliferation, apoptosis, necrosis, and the  related gene expression in bovine satellite cells (BSCs), isolated from bovine muscles. Cell viability was significantly increased with the OA and LA treatment. Furthermore, LA + OA enhanced cell proliferation in a dose-dependent manner (10 to 100 µM), whereas it lowered at 250 µM. In addition, a cell-cycle analysis showed that 100 µM of LA and OA markedly decreased the G0/G1 phase proportion (62.58% and 61.33%, respectively), compared to controls (68.02%), whereas the S-phase cells' proportion was increased. The ratio of G2/M phase cells was not significantly different among the groups. Moreover, analyses with AO/EtBr staining showed that no apoptosis occurred. Necrosis were determined by flow cytometry using Annexin V-FITC/PI staining which revealed no early apoptosis in the cells pretreated with LA or OA, but occurred in the LA + OA group. We also analyzed the mRNA expression of  metabolizing genes such as peroxisome proliferator receptor alfa (PPARα), peroxisome proliferator receptor gamma (PPARγ), acyl-CoA oxidase (ACOX), lipoprotein lipase (LPL), carnitine palmitoyl transferase (CPT-1), and fatty- binding protein4 (FABP4), which were upregulated in LA or OA treated cells compared to the control group.

However, the underlying regulatory mechanisms of Plin5 are not clear. The goal of the present study was to explore the mechanism of  (OA)-induced Plin5 expression in HepG2 cells. We found that the expression of Plin5 was increased during OA-induced  droplets formation in a dose- and time-dependent manner. During this process of OA-stimulated  droplets formation, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα) was also upregulated. When PPARα activation was blocked by GW6471, OA-induced Plin5 expression and  droplets formation were effectively ablated. We further found that the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor LY294002 was able to downregulate both PPARα and Plin5 expression and  droplets formation. Thus, we concluded that PI3K may, at least in part, act upstream of PPARα to regulate Plin5 expression and  droplets formation in HepG2 cells.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30728499>Evidence for an alternative fatty  desaturation pathway increasing cancer plasticity.</a></h1><p>Most tumours have an aberrantly activated  that enables them to synthesize, elongate and desaturate fatty acids to support proliferation. However, only particular subsets of cancer cells are sensitive to approaches that target fatty   and, in particular, fatty  desaturation. This suggests that many cancer cells contain an unexplored plasticity in their fatty  . Here we show that some cancer cells can exploit an alternative fatty  desaturation pathway. We identify various cancer cell lines, mouse hepatocellular carcinomas, and primary human liver and lung carcinomas that desaturate palmitate to the unusual fatty  sapienate to support membrane biosynthesis during proliferation. Accordingly, we found that sapienate biosynthesis enables cancer cells to bypass the known fatty  desaturation pathway that is dependent on stearoyl-CoA desaturase. Thus, only by targeting both desaturation pathways is the in vitro and in vivo proliferation of cancer cells that synthesize sapienate impaired. Our discovery explains metabolic plasticity in fatty  desaturation and constitutes an unexplored metabolic rewiring in cancers.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30572061>Cellular toxicity of dietary trans fatty acids and its correlation with ceramide and diglyceride accumulation.</a></h1><p>High fatty  (FA) levels are deleterious to pancreatic β-cells, largely due to the accumulation of biosynthetic  intermediates, such as ceramides and diglycerides, which induce ER stress and apoptosis. Toxicity of palmitate (16:0) and oleate (18:1 cis-Δ) has been widely investigated, while very little data is available on the cell damages caused by elaidate (18:1 trans-Δ) and vaccenate (18:1 trans-Δ), although the potential health effects of these dietary trans fatty acids (TFAs) received great publicity. We compared the effects of these four FAs on cell viability, apoptosis, ER stress, JNK phosphorylation and autophagy as well as on ceramide and diglyceride contents in RINm5F insulinoma cells. Similarly to oleate and unlike palmitate, TFAs reduced cell viability only at higher concentration, and they had mild effects on ER stress, apoptosis and autophagy. Palmitate increased ceramide and diglyceride levels far more than any of the unsaturated fatty acids; however, incorporation of TFAs in ceramides and diglycerides was strikingly more pronounced than that of oleate. This indicates a correlation between the accumulation of  intermediates and the severity of cell damage. Our findings reveal important metabolic characteristics of TFAs that might underlie a long term toxicity and hence deserve further investigation.Copyright © 2018.

These FAs are intracellularly converted into triglyceride (TG) molecules, before they are packaged into chylomicrons for transport to the lymph or into cytosolic  droplets (LDs) for intracellular storage. A crucial step for the formation of LDs is the catalytic activity of diacylglycerol acyltransferases (DGAT) in the final step of TG synthesis. LDs are important to buffer toxic  species and regulate cellular  in different cell types. Since the human intestinal epithelium is regularly confronted with high concentrations of lipids, LD formation is of great importance to regulate homeostasis. Here we describe a simple assay for the characterization and quantification of LD formation (LDF) upon stimulation with the most common unsaturated fatty , , in human intestinal organoids. The LDF assay is based on the LD-specific fluorescent dye LD540, which allows for quantification of LDs by confocal microscopy, fluorescent plate reader, or flow cytometry. The LDF assay can be used to characterize LD formation in human intestinal epithelial cells, or to study human (genetic) disorders that affect LD , such as DGAT1 deficiency. Furthermore, this assay can also be used in a high-throughput pipeline to test novel therapeutic compounds, which restore defects in LD formation in intestinal or other types of organoids.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30417996>Comparative Study of Orange and its Main Bioactive Constituents as Remedy for Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver in Rats.</a></h1><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is accused as inducer of both cardiovascular and chronic liver diseases. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the therapeutic effect of combined freeze dried orange juice with its dried pulp supplemented with methionine, as functional food, in comparison to orange bioactive constituents, as parallel formula, in NAFLD rat model.Proximate composition, dietary fibers, minerals, total phenolics, fatty acids and phytosterols were determined in the orange functional food. The NAFLD was induced in rats through feeding high fructose diet. The prepared functional food and its parallel formula were evaluated in NAFLD rats through determination of liver  and plasma  profile, malondialdehyde, tumor necrosis factor-α, leptin, insulin and glucose as well as liver and kidney function with histopathological examination of the liver. Insulin resistance (IR) and total cholesterol/high density lipoprotein cholesterol were calculated.Orange functional food was shown to contain 9.17% dietary fibers, 1.4% potassium, 1.4 phenolic content as mg gallic /g,  as the major fatty  (29.75% of total fatty acids) and 11.97% phytosterols from unsaponifiable matter. The studied formulas produced reduction of liver and plasma lipids, inflammatory and oxidative stress biomarkers, IR and leptin with improving liver function and histopathology pointing to potential management of NAFLD.Orange functional food and its parallel formula were promising in management of NAFLD; with superiority to orange functional food.

ACT, a water-soluble phenylpropanoid glycoside, is the most abundant and major active component of ; the leaves of , known as kudingcha (bitter tea), have long been used in China as an herbal tea for weight loss. Recently, based on previous studies, our team reached a preliminary conclusion that phenylpropanoid glycosides from  most likely contribute substantially to reducing  levels, but the mechanism remains unclear. Here, we conducted an  screen of currently known phenylethanoid glycosides from  and attempted to explore the hypolipidemic mechanism of ACT, the representative component of phenylethanoid glycosides in , using RNA-seq technology, quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) and Western blotting. First, the screening results for six compounds were docked with 15 human protein targets, and 3 of 15 protein targets were related to cardiovascular diseases. Based on previous experimental data and docking results, we selected ACT, which exerted positive effects, for further study. We generated a  accumulation model using HepG2 cells treated with a high concentration of  and then extracted RNA from cells treated for 24 h with 50 μmol/L ACT. Subsequently, we performed a transcriptomic analysis of the RNA-seq results, which revealed a large number of differentially expressed genes. Finally, we randomly selected some genes and proteins for further validation using qPCR and Western blotting; the results agreed with the RNA-seq data and confirmed their reliability. In conclusion, our experiments proved that ACT from  alters  and synthesis by regulating the expression of multiple genes, including , , , , , , , and , which are involved several pathways, such as the glycolytic, AMPK, and fatty  degradation pathways.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31112599>PPARα/β Activation Alleviates Age-Associated Renal Fibrosis in Sprague Dawley Rats.</a></h1><p>Age-associated renal fibrosis is commonly observed, with a decline in renal function during aging. Although peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors α/β (PPARα/β) activation has been shown to exert beneficial effects on age-associated renal changes, its effects on age-associated renal fibrosis have not been investigated yet. Here, we show that the PPARα/β activator, MHY2013, can significantly alter  in renal tubule epithelial cells and attenuate renal fibrosis in aged Sprague Dawley (SD) rats. We found that MHY2013 significantly increased nuclear translocation and activity of PPARα/β in NRK52E renal epithelial cells. Moreover, the enhanced PPARα/β activity increased the expression of fatty  oxidation-associated PPARα/β target genes. In addition, transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)- and -induced  accumulation and fibrosis-associated gene expression were decreased in NRK52E cells by MHY2013 pretreatment. To evaluate the effects of MHY2013 on age-associated renal fibrosis, aged SD rates were orally administered MHY2013 (1 and 5 mg/kg) daily for 1 month. MHY2013 efficiently increased PPARα/β activation and reduced renal  accumulation in aged SD rat kidneys. Furthermore, renal fibrosis was significantly decreased by MHY2013, indicating the importance of renal  in age-associated renal fibrosis. Taken together, our results suggest that activation of PPARα/β signaling during aging prevents age-associated renal fibrosis.© The Author(s) 2019.

In this scenario, the extraction of seaweeds represents an interesting source of compounds displaying antimicrobial activity. In particular, among the different red algae,  plays an important role due to the presence of important bioactives in its composition. In spite of these features, an efficient culture system is still absent. In the present study, a novel algal culture method was developed and compared to another more common cultural practice, widely reported in literature. A higher efficiency of the new method, both for daily growth rate and biomass, was assessed. Furthermore, the growth inhibitory activity of five extracts, obtained using ethanol, methanol, acetone, chloroform or diethyl ether as a solvent, from the cultured  was tested against Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens. Algal extracts exhibited a considerable inhibitory activity against  strains, while a slight inhibition was observed against . The different extracts showed significant differences in bacterial growth inhibition, with the highest activity that was recorded for the ethanol extract, followed by that of methanol. Based on the chemical characterization, these findings could be related to the antimicrobial activity played by the combination of total carbohydrates and polyphenols, which were determined at high levels in ethanol and methanol extracts, as well as by the highest number and levels of single polyphenols. Conversely, the lower growth inhibitory activities found in chloroform and diethyl ether extracts could be related to the isolation of minor  classes (e.g., neutral and medium polar lipids) composed by fatty acids, such as stearic,  and arachidonic acids, typically characterized by antimicrobial activity. In consideration of the results obtained, the present study has a double implication, involving both the field of cultural practices and the exploitation of natural sources for the isolation of antimicrobial agents useful both in pharmaceutical and food applications.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31343008>trans-Trismethoxy resveratrol decreased  accumulation dependent on -6 and -7 in Caenorhabditis elegans.</a></h1><p>trans-Trismethoxy resveratrol (TMR) is a methyl analog of resveratrol. It is found to exhibit enhanced biological effects compared to resveratrol, such as inhibition of cancer cell growth and pro-apoptotic activities.

In this study, we used Caenorhabditis elegans, an in vivo nematode model which has been widely applied in disease research, including research on obesity, to investigate the effect of TMR on . Treatment with TMR (100 and 200 μM) for 4 days significantly reduced triglyceride accumulation (14% and 20% reduction over the control, respectively) of C. elegans, without affecting nematode growth, food intake and reproduction. Treatment with TMR significantly downregulated stearoyl-CoA desaturase genes, -6 and -7, accompanied by a decrease in the desaturation index of fatty acids, the ratio of  to stearic .

Measurement of specific products of OA within the complex mixture of digesta lipids is however challenging. Therefore, this in vitro trial combined the isotopic labelling technique with the use of rumen inoculum from cannulated sheep fed a diet supplemented or not with 2% of fish oil (which has been demonstrated to cause MFD in dairy ruminants) to characterize the  of OA in response to ruminal alterations associated with MFD. The products of C-OA after 24 h of incubation were analysed by gas chromatography-combustion isotope ratio mass spectrometry (GC-C-IRMS). Numerous C-labeled 18:1 intermediates and oxygenated FA were detected and no elongation or desaturation of OA occurred. Diet supplementation with fish oil (i.e., MFD conditions) resulted in no unique metabolites of OA but in relevant changes in the relative contribution of specific metabolic pathways. The inhibition of 18:0 saturation caused by this treatment appeared largely attributable to increased oxygenated FA proportion, in particular the candidate milk  inhibitor 10-oxo-18:0, and warrants further research on the association between MFD and oxygenated FA. Changes in the concentration of C-labeled  18:1 intermediates but not in  18:1, were also observed.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30981498>-induced defective autolysosome shows impaired  degradation.</a></h1><p>Recent studies suggest an alternative pathway of  breakdown called lipophagy, which delivers  droplets (LDs) to lysosomes for degradation of LDs. However, molecular mechanisms regulating lipophagy are still largely unknown. In this study, we evaluated the effect of  (OA) on lipophagy in cells. We found that OA treatment results in accumulation of p62 and LC3-II proteins and reduces red fluorescence in cells stably expressing mCherry-GFP-LC3. In addition, OA inhibits the co-localization of LC3 with LAMP1 under serum-deprived condition, suggesting that OA blocks autophagosome-lysosome fusion. In the cells with ATG5 or ULK1 gene deletion, LDs did not increase upon OA treatment more than in wild type cells. However, cell starvation following OA removal resulted in reduced  accumulation by lipophagy and recovery of autophagy flux, suggesting that the specific condition of OA treatment and cell starvation are important for lipophagy flux activity.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

However, the molecular mechanism of GLP-1 on NAFLD is remained unclear. The present study was to detect whether the effect of GLP-1 on triglyceride (TG) content in hepatocytes is dependent on Foxos.  HepG2 cells were treated with palmitic/ for 24 h. The knockdown of Foxo1, Foxo3 was conducted through small interfering RNA (siRNA). Real time PCT (RT-PCR) was used to detect the changes of the SREBP1c and Aco genes in HepG2 cells after Foxo1/3 knockdown.  As expected, palmitic/ increased TG concentration in HepG2 cells [(12.65 ± 1.32) μg/mg vs. (4.32±0.54) μg/mg, 0.05]. Addition of GLP-1 dose (10, 50, 100nmol/L) dependently lowered the TG content and reached plateau at 100 nmol/L of GLP-1 [TG(8.38±1.47) μg/mg]. The GLP-1 effect on TG remained after knocking down either Foxo1 [(9.09±1.34)μg/mg] or Foxo3 [(8.90±1.60) μg/mg] alone, but not when knocking down Foxo1 and Foxo3 (Foxo1/3) together [(14.66±1.77)μg/mg]. Moreover, knocking down Foxo1/3 also abolished GLP-1 effect on SREBP1c and Aco expression.  GLP-1 can inhibit the synthesis of TG in hepatocytes depending on Foxo1 and Foxo3. Further studies are needed to explore the specific mechanisms.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31404911>Myo-inositol alters 13C-labeled fatty   in human placental explants.</a></h1><p>We postulate that myo-inositol, a proposed intervention for gestational-diabetes, affects transplacental  supply to the fetus. We investigated the effect of myo-inositol on fatty- processing in human placental-explants from uncomplicated pregnancies. Explants were incubated with 13C-labeled palmitic-, 13C- and 13C-docosahexaenoic- across a range of myo-inositol concentrations for 24 h and 48 h. The incorporation of labeled-fatty-acids into individual lipids was quantified by liquid-chromatography-mass-spectrometry. At 24 h, myo-inositol increased the amount of 13C-palmitic- and 13C- labeled lipids (median fold-change relative to control=1). Significant effects were seen with 30 µM myo-inositol (physiological) for 13C-palmitic--lysophosphatidylcholines (1.26) and 13C-palmitic--phosphatidylethanolamines (1.17). At 48 h, myo-inositol addition increased 13C--lipids but decreased 13C-palmitic- and 13C-docosahexaenoic- lipids. Significant effects were seen with 30 µM myo-inositol for 13C--phosphatidylcholines (1.25), 13C--phosphatidylethanolamines (1.37) and 13C--triacylglycerols (1.32) and with 100 µM myo-inositol for 13C-docosahexaenoic--triacylglycerols (0.78). Lipids labeled with the same 13C-fatty- showed similar responses when tested at the same time-point, suggesting myo-inositol alters upstream processes such as fatty- uptake or activation.

A total of 27 Large White × Landrace growing pigs at 44 ± 1 d of age (11.96 ± 0.18 kg) were randomly allocated to three treatments ( = 9). Dietary treatments included: (1) normal protein diet with 20% crude protein (CP) (NP); (2) a low crude protein diet formulated to contain approximately 17% CP (LP); and (3) a low crude protein diet with 17% CP supplemented with 1% AKG at the expense of regular corn components (ALP).

The results showed that compared with the NP and LP diets, supplementation with AKG in a low-protein diet increased the intramuscular  (IMF),  (C18:1n-9), and monounsaturated fatty  (MUFA) contents ( < 0.05), and tended to increase the percentage of palmitoleic  (C16:1) and stearic  (C18:0) ( < 0.10) in the biceps femoris and longissimus dorsi muscles of growing pigs. These effects may be associated with increased relative mRNA expression levels of fatty  synthase (FAS), acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), adipocyte determination and differentiation factor 1 (ADD1), fatty  binding protein 4 (FABP4), and stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD) in skeletal muscle, indicating that AKG might be involved in the differential regulation of some key lipogenic genes in skeletal muscles of pigs.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30366981>Cilostazol Improves HFD-Induced Hepatic Steatosis by Upregulating Hepatic STAMP2 Expression through AMPK.</a></h1><p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is an increasingly studied condition that can progress to end-stage liver disease. Although NAFLD was first described in 1980, a complete understanding of the mechanism and causes of this disease is still lacking. Six-transmembrane protein of prostate 2 (STAMP2) plays a role in integrating inflammatory and nutritional signals with . Our previous study suggested that STAMP2 may be a suitable target for treating NAFLD. In the current study, we performed a focused drug-screening and found that cilostazol could be a potential STAMP2 enhancer. Thus, we examined whether cilostazol alleviates NAFLD through STAMP2. The in vivo and in vitro pharmacological efficacies of cilostazol on STAMP2 expression and  accumulation were analyzed in NAFLD mice induced by high- diet (HFD) and in HepG2 cell lines treated by  (OA), respectively. Cilostazol increased the expression of STAMP2 through transcriptional regulation in vivo and in vitro. Cilostazol also dampened the STAMP2 downregulation caused by the HFD and by OA in vivo and in vitro, respectively. Cilostazol activated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in vivo and in vitro, and AMPK functions upstream of STAMP2, and reversed downregulation of STAMP2 expression through AMPK in the NAFLD model. Cilostazol ameliorates hepatic steatosis by enhancing hepatic STAMP2 expression through AMPK. Enhancing STAMP2 expression with cilostazol represents a potential therapeutic avenue for treatment of NAFLD.Copyright © 2018 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30908685>Essential Fatty  Requirements and Intravenous  Emulsions.</a></h1><p>Linoleic  (LA) and α-linolenic  (ALA) must be supplied to the human body and are therefore considered essential fatty acids.

EFAD may occur in patients with conditions that severely limit the intake, digestion, absorption, and/or  of . EFAD may be prevented in patients requiring parenteral nutrition by inclusion of an intravenous  emulsion (ILE) as a source of LA and ALA. Early ILEs consisted solely of soybean oil (SO), a good source of LA and ALA, but being rich in LA may promote the production of proinflammatory fatty acids. Subsequent ILE formulations replaced part of the SO with other  sources to decrease the amount of proinflammatory fatty acids. Although rare, EFAD is diagnosed by an elevated triene:tetraene (T:T) ratio, which reflects increased  of  to Mead  in the absence of adequate LA and ALA. Assays for measuring fatty acids have improved over the years, and therefore it is necessary to take into account the particular assay used and its reference range when determining if the T:T ratio indicates EFAD. In patients with a high degree of suspicion for EFAD, obtaining a fatty  profile may provide additional useful information for making a diagnosis of EFAD. In patients receiving an ILE, the T:T ratio and fatty  profile should be interpreted in light of the fatty  composition of the ILE to ensure accurate diagnosis of EFAD.© 2019 American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30576936>Sodium tanshinone IIA sulfonate ameliorates hepatic steatosis by inhibiting lipogenesis and inflammation.</a></h1><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is becoming an epidemic disease in adults and children worldwide. Importantly, there are currently no approved treatments available for NAFLD. This study aims to investigate the potential applications of sodium tanshinone IIA sulfonate (STS) on improving the NAFLD condition using both in vitro and in vivo approaches. The results showed that STS markedly inhibited  accumulation in  (OA) and palmitic  (PA) treated HepG2 and primary immortalized human hepatic (PIH) cells. STS suppressed lipogenesis by inhibiting expression of sterol regulatory element binding transcription factor 1 (SREBF1), fatty  synthase (FASN) and stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD). In addition, STS reduced inflammation in cells treated with OA-PA, shown by decreased transcriptional levels of tumor necrosis factor (TNF), transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGFB1) and interleukin 1 beta (IL1B). Consistently, protective effects on hepatic steatosis in db/db mice were observed after STS administration, demonstrated by decreased  accumulation in mouse hepatocytes. This protective effect might be associated with STS induced activation of sirtuin 1 (SIRT1)/protein kinase AMP-activated catalytic subunit alpha 1 (PRKAA1) pathways.

Fusarium graminearum, the main causal agent of Fusarium head blight on wheat, affects crop yields and grain quality by alteration of their biochemical components and mycotoxin contamination, which reduces the possibilities of wheat end use and compromises food safety.  degradation by hydrolytic, oxidative and microbial deterioration is the predominant cause of the loss of sensory acceptability, nutritional value and baking quality. The aim of this research was to determine the influence of adverse environmental conditions -as the increasing moisture - on  patterns of whole wheat flours contaminated with F. graminearum in relation to the infection degree. In vitro cultures of F. graminearum were carried out on wheat grains under different degrees of relative humidity (11, 50, 75 and 100%) throughout 45 days of incubation at 28 °C. The fungal biomass measured by q-PCR increased proportionally with the humidity. A decrease in the signals of saturated (palmitic and estearic) and unsaturated (, linoleic and linolenic) fatty acids, analyzed as fatty  methyl esters (FAMEs) by GC-MS, was observed in relation with the humidity and infection degree. The degradation rate of the lipids was high during the first 15 days of incubation, reaching the fatty acids content, values around 20-40% of those found in the control. From that moment on, the rate of degradation was slower or even null. It was observed that in all treatments, the linolenic  reached the highest degradation ratio in comparison with the other fatty acids, which may be caused by the action of lipoxygenases. The lipase activity and the content of deoxynivalenol were also determinate on the flours. The lipase activity increased until day 25 of incubation reaching twice the initial value. The deoxynivalenol content also increased along incubation while fatty acids decreased. Our results demonstrated that the magnitude in the signal of fatty acids in whole wheat flours varied in relation to the degree of humidity and fungal infection of the grains from which they were obtained. Otherwise, lipids and their oxidation products are related with the pathogenesis and production of mycotoxins. These observations highlight the importance of an adequate manipulation of wheat grains on the processing chain to prevent quality changes and mycotoxins contamination.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

However, the role of LDs and its  source remains largely unexplored. Here, we found that  (OA) was a potent inducer of astrocytic LD accumulation among various FAs. Lipidomic analysis using liquid chromatography equipped with tandem mass spectrometry revealed that the cellular triacylglycerol and phospholipid compositions in astrocytes during LD accumulation reflected the condition of extracellular FAs. Furthermore, the inhibition of diacylglycerol acyltransferase blocked OA-induced LD accumulation and caused lipotoxicity-induced cell death in astrocytes.

RES also attenuated FFA-triggered reactive oxygen species (ROS) secretion and restored mitochondrial membrane potential consumption, as well as the restoration of mitochondrial respiratory complex expression. This study provides compelling evidence that RES controls intracellular  metabolic imbalance in a Bmal1-dependent manner. Overall, RES may serve as a promising natural nutraceutical for the regulation of  metabolic disorders relevant to the circadian clock.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31215273>Vascular endothelial growth factor B inhibits  accumulation in C2C12 myotubes incubated with fatty acids.</a></h1><p>To investigate (1) the effect of vascular endothelial growth factor B (VEGFB) on  accumulation and the alteration of fatty acids and fatty -related enzymes in C2C12 myotubes incubated with fatty acids and (2) the regulatory effect of VEGFB on skeletal muscle . Mouse C2C12 myotubes were incubated with  (OA) and palmitic  (PA), and differentiated mature C2C12 myotubes were treated with VEGFB. Oil-red O staining, BODIPY staining and cell triglycerides (TG) content were examined. Total RNA was isolated, and real-time PCR analysis was performed. Treatment with 100 μM OA and 50 μM PA induced  droplet accumulation and increased TG content ( < .01), and 100 ng/mL VEGFB reduced  droplet accumulation and decreased TG content ( < .01). Treatment with 100 ng/mL VEGFB significantly induced the mRNA expression of fatty  transport protein 1 (FATP1) ( < .01) and FATP4 ( < .01). Treatment with 100 ng/mL VEGFB significantly induced the mRNA expression of adipose TG lipase and hormone-sensitive lipase ( < .01) as well as carnitine palmitoyltransferase I ( < .01), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator-1α ( < .01), acyl-coa dehydrogenase very long chain ( < .05), acyl-coa synthetase long-chain family member 1 ( < .01), peroxisomal acyl-coenzyme A oxidase 1 ( < .05), and mitochondrial uncoupling protein 3 ( < .01).

The  genome contains two annotated  genes, called  and  AcpA is encoded within the fatty  synthesis (fab) operon and appears essential. In contrast, AcpB is an atypical ACP, having only 30% residue identity with AcpA, and is not essential. Deletion of  has no effect on  growth or  fatty  synthesis in media lacking fatty acids. However, unlike the wild-type strain, where growth with  resulted in almost complete blockage of  fatty  synthesis, the  strain largely continued  fatty  synthesis under these conditions. Blockage in the wild-type strain is due to repression of  operon transcription, leading to levels of fatty  synthetic proteins (including AcpA) that are insufficient to support  synthesis. Transcription of the  operon is regulated by FabT, a repressor protein that binds DNA only when it is bound to an acyl-ACP ligand. Since AcpA is encoded in the  operon, its synthesis is blocked when the operon is repressed and  thus cannot provide a stable supply of ACP for synthesis of the acyl-ACP ligand required for DNA binding by FabT. In contrast to AcpA,  transcription is unaffected by growth with exogenous fatty acids and thus provides a stable supply of ACP for conversion to the acyl-ACP ligand required for repression by FabT. Indeed,  and  strains have essentially the same  fatty  synthesis phenotype in -grown cultures, which argues that neither strain can form the FabT-acyl-ACP repression complex. Finally, acylated derivatives of both AcpB and AcpA were substrates for the  enoyl-ACP reductases and for  PlsX (acyl-ACP; phosphate acyltransferase). AcpB homologs are encoded by many, but not all, lactic  bacteria (), including many members of the human microbiome. The mechanisms regulating fatty  synthesis by exogenous fatty acids play a key role in resistance of these bacteria to those antimicrobials targeted at fatty  synthesis enzymes. Defective regulation can increase resistance to such inhibitors and also reduce pathogenesis.Copyright © 2019 Zhu et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30527986>Energy and nitrogen partitioning in dairy cows at low or high metabolizable protein levels is affected differently by postrumen glucogenic and lipogenic substrates.</a></h1><p>This study tested the effects of energy from glucogenic (glucose; GG) or lipogenic (palm olein; LG) substrates at low (LMP) and high (HMP) metabolizable protein levels on whole-body energy and N partitioning of dairy cattle. Six rumen-fistulated, second-lactation Holstein-Friesian dairy cows (97 ± 13 d in milk) were randomly assigned to a 6 × 6 Latin square design in which each experimental period consisted of 5 d of continuous abomasal infusion followed by 2 d of rest. A total mixed ration consisting of 42% corn silage, 31% grass silage, and 27% concentrate (dry matter basis) was formulated to meet 100 and 83% of net energy and metabolizable protein requirements, respectively, and was fed at 90% of ad libitum intake by individual cow. Abomasal infusion treatments were saline (LMP-C), isoenergetic infusions (digestible energy basis) of 1,319 g/d of glucose (LMP-GG), 676 g/d of palm olein (LMP-LG; major fatty  constituents are palmitic, , and linoleic ), or 844 g/d of essential AA (HMP-C), or isoenergetic infusions of 1,319 g/d of glucose + 844 g/d of essential AA (HMP-GG) or 676 g/d of palm olein + 844 g/d of essential AA (HMP-LG). The experiment was conducted in climate respiration chambers to determine energy and N balance in conjunction with milk production and composition, nutrient digestibility, and plasma constituents. Infusion of GG and LG decreased dry matter intake, but total gross energy intake from the diet plus infusions was not affected by GG or LG. Furthermore, GG or LG did not affect total milk, protein, or lactose yields. Infusing GG or LG at the HMP level did not affect milk production differently than at the LMP level. Infusion of GG stimulated energy retention in body tissue, increased plasma glucose and insulin concentrations, decreased lipogenic metabolites in plasma, and decreased milk  yield and milk energy output. Nitrogen intake decreased and milk N efficiency increased in response to GG, and N retention was not affected. Infusion of LG tended to increase metabolizable energy intake, increased milk  yield and milk energy output, increased plasma triacylglycerides and long-chain fatty  concentrations, and had no effect on energy retention. Infusion of LG decreased N intake but did not affect milk N efficiency or N retention. Compared with the LMP level, the HMP level increased dry matter intake, gross and metabolizable energy intake, and total milk, , protein, and lactose yields. Milk energy output increased at the HMP level, and protein level did not affect total energy retention. Heat production increased at the HMP level, but only when GG and LG were infused. The HMP level increased N intake, milk N output, and plasma urea concentration, tended to increase N retention, and decreased milk N efficiency. Regardless of protein level, GG promoted energy retention and improved milk N efficiency, but not through increased milk protein yield. Infusion of LG partitioned extra energy intake into milk and had no effect on milk N efficiency.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Sixty male and female rats were randomly assigned to control, exhaustive exercise and one-week recovery groups, respectively. The metabolic profiles of plasma were investigated by gas chromatograph-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and data further underwent orthogonal partial least-squares (OPLS) analysis. The current study found that gender was a significant determinant of the effects of exhaustive exercise on the cortisol, blood urea nitrogen, creatine kinase, and the ratio of reduced glutathione to oxidized glutathione, whereas, no significant interaction effects between gender and exhaustive exercise were found on the levels of testosterone, malonaldehyde, reduced glutathione, oxidized glutathione and lactic dehydrogenase. In male rats, the altered metabolites within exhaustive exercise included increased tricarboxylic  cycle intermediates (citric , fumaric , butanedioic ), branch-chain amino acids (valine, leucine), fatty acids and metabolite (, linoleic , 3-hydroxybutyric ), phosphate and decreased glucose, lactic , serine, and glutamic . In female rats, the levels of fatty acids and metabolite (linoleic , , arachidonic , 3-hydroxybutyric ), amino acids (valine, leucine, glutamic , 5-oxo-proline, methionine, ornithine), other metabolites urea, myo-inositol and phosphate were increased. The results indicated that exhaustive exercise increased the rates of energy , glucose , amino  catabolism and fatty   in male rats, whereas, female rats showed an increased propensity to oxidize  and conserve carbohydrate and protein  against physical stress. Disordered urea cycle and inositol  also occurred in female rats with exhaustive exercise. Exhaustive exercise affected the balance of hormone adjustment and caused oxidative stress, subsequent cell membrane damage both in male and female rats.

However, it is essential to understand the consequences of reducing FAD2 activity on the , cell biology and physiology of oilseed crop plants. Here, we translate knowledge from studies of fad2 mutants in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) to investigate the limits of non-GMO approaches to maximize  in the seed oil of canola (Brassica napus), a species that expresses three active FAD2 isozymes. A series of hypomorphic and null mutations in the FAD2.A5 isoform were characterized in yeast (Saccharomyes cerevisiae). Then, four of these were combined with null mutations in the other two isozymes, FAD2.C5 and FAD2.C1. The resulting mutant lines contained 71-87%  in their seed oil, compared with 62% in wild-type controls. All the mutant lines grew well in a greenhouse, but in field experiments we observed a clear demarcation in plant performance. Mutant lines containing less than 80% oleate in the seed oil were indistinguishable from wild-type controls in growth parameters and seed oil content. By contrast, lines with more than 80% oleate in the seed oil had significantly lower seedling establishment and vigor, delayed flowering and reduced plant height at maturity. These lines also had 7-11% reductions in seed oil content. Our results extend understanding of the B. napusFAD2 isozymes and define the practical limit to increasing oil oleate content in this crop species.© 2018 The Authors The Plant Journal © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30562559>Hepatic mTOR-AKT2-Insig2 signaling pathway contributes to the improvement of hepatic steatosis after Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass in mice.</a></h1><p>Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass (RYGB) remains one of the most effective options in treatment of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). However, the underlying mechanisms are not clear yet. Here, we evaluated the relationship among hepatic mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR)-AKT2-insulin-induced gene 2 (Insig2) signaling, lipogenic transcription factors and  synthesis enzymes in obese mice with or without RYGB operation. Hepatic mTOR activity and Insig2a were stimulated, while AKT2, sterol response element-binding protein 1c (SREBP1c), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ), lipogenic genes such as acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) and fatty  synthase (FAS) were decreased by Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass in both DMSO and rapamycin treated diet-induced obese (DIO) mice. Increment of hepatic lipogenesis and decline of mTOR signaling induced by rapamycin were significantly reversed by RYGB in DIO mice. RYGB significantly improved high- diet- and rapamycin- induced hepatic steatosis by suppression of de novo lipogenesis. Administration of adenovirus-mediated p70 ribosomal protein subunit 6 kinase 1 (Ad-S6K1) from tail vein improved hepatic steatosis. Infusion of Ad-S6K1 suppressed AKT2, SREBP1c, PPARγ, and lipogenesis-related genes while stimulating Insig2a in DIO mice. Ad-S6K1 decreased -induced  deposition in primary mouse hepatocytes. Our results suggest that mTOR-AKT2-Insig2 signaling pathway contributes to the improvement effect of RYGB on hepatic steatosis induced by high- diet.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

In pancreatic β-cells, it helps counter the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress that impairs insulin secretory capacity during Type 2 diabetes. Chronic exposure of β-cells to saturated fatty acids (FAs) such as palmitate stimulates ER stress and modulates autophagy, but the effects of unsaturated FAs such as oleate, which are also elevated during obesity, are less well understood. We therefore treated MIN6 cells and mouse islets for 8-48 h with either palmitate or oleate, and then monitored autophagic flux, signaling pathways, lysosomal biology, and phospholipid profiles. Compared with palmitate, oleate more effectively stimulated both autophagic flux and clearance of autophagosomes. The flux stimulation occurred independently of ER stress, nutrient-sensing (mTOR) and signaling pathways (protein kinases A, C, and D). Instead the mechanism involved the exchange factor directly activated by cAMP 2 (EPAC2). Oleate reduced cellular cAMP, and its effects on autophagic flux were reproduced or inhibited, respectively, by  knockdown or activation. Oleate also increased lysosomal acidity and increased phospholipid saturation, consistent with improved autophagosomal fusion with lysosomes. We conclude that a potent stimulation of autophagy might help explain the known benefits of unsaturated FAs in countering the toxicity of saturated FAs in β-cells during obesity and  loading.© 2019 Chu et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30642786> production by Lipomyces starkeyi using sap squeezed from felled old oil palm trunks.</a></h1><p>The ability of oleaginous yeast Lipomyces starkeyi to efficiently produce lipids when cultivated on sap extracted from felled oil palm trunk (OPT) as a novel inexpensive renewable carbon source was evaluated. OPT sap was found to contain approximately 98 g/L glucose and 32 g/L fructose. Batch fermentations were performed using three different OPT sap medium conditions: regular sap, enriched sap, and enriched sap at pH 5.0.

Although several nanosystems have been lately investigated, nanostructured  carriers (NLCs) give promises of potential safety, biodegradability and controlled drug release. In the current study, NLCs comprising either precirol, stearic  or beeswax as solid  in presence of  as liquid  and PVA or poloxamer as emulsifier were prepared. Optimized NLCs (200-268 nm in size) were appraised versus SLNs both in vitro and in vivo. Precirol/PVA-based SLNs and NLCs ensued high entrapment efficiencies (EE > 95%) and controlled release behaviour over 6 h even though NLCs showed higher release profile. Stability studies at 4 °C indicated potential colloidal and entrapment stability over 3 months. Interestingly, NLCs demonstrated efficient nebulization, low interaction with mucin and higher viability of A549 cells (3-fold increase in IC relative to SLNs) providing good aptitudes for pulmonary application. In vivo administration of free SC in rats revealed localized intra-alveolar bleeding, presumably related to excessive vasodilatation. Meanwhile, the nanoencapsulated drug confirmed normal lung parenchyma with minimal incidence of bleeding.

This study determined the fatty  profile of Spanish lacto-ovo vegetarians (LO-vegetarians) and vegans. Participants were 104 healthy adults, LO-vegetarians ( = 49) and vegans ( = 55). Lifestyle habits and consumption of food and omega-3 supplements were estimated by questionnaires. BMI, blood pressure, and abdominal and body  were determined. Serum was collected to analyze fatty acids, glucose, lipids, homocysteine, insulin, and leptin. Volunteers were classified according to serum omega-6 to omega-3 (-6/-3) ratio into three groups: -6/-3 < 10, -6/-3 ≥ 10 to 20, and -6/-3 > 20. Results showed low cardiovascular risk and high insulin sensitivity with negligible differences between diet types.

Dietary  triggers the synthesis of oleoylethanolamide (OEA), a regulatory fatty  that signals satiety to reduce food intake mainly by enhancing neural PPARα activity, in enterocytes. We explored OEA's roles in the assembly of lipoproteins in WT and   mouse enterocytes and hepatocytes, Caco-2 cells, and human liver-derived cells. In differentiated Caco-2 cells, OEA increased synthesis and secretion of triacylglycerols, apoB secretion in chylomicrons, and MTP expression in a dose-dependent manner. OEA also increased MTP activity and triacylglycerol secretion in WT and knockout primary enterocytes. In contrast to its intestinal cell effects, OEA reduced synthesis and secretion of triacylglycerols, apoB secretion, and MTP expression and activity in human hepatoma Huh-7 and HepG2 cells. Also, OEA reduced MTP expression and triacylglycerol secretion in WT, but not knockout, primary hepatocytes. These studies indicate differential effects of OEA on  synthesis and lipoprotein assembly: in enterocytes, OEA augments glycerolipid synthesis and lipoprotein assembly independent of PPARα. Conversely, in hepatocytes, OEA reduces MTP expression, glycerolipid synthesis, and lipoprotein secretion through PPARα-dependent mechanisms.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30680004>Gemfibrozil reduces  accumulation in SMMC-7721 cells via the involvement of PPARα and SREBP1.</a></h1><p>Gemfibrozil (GEM) is a member of the fibrate class of -lowering pharmaceuticals and has been widely used in the therapy of different forms of hyperlipidemia and hypercholesterolemia. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common chronic liver disease and is becoming an important public health concern worldwide. However, there is little knowledge about the effects of GEM on NAFLD. In the present study, oleate-treated human hepatoma SMMC-7721 cells were utilized to investigate the role of GEM in regulating hepatic . The present results demonstrated that GEM attenuated excessive intracellular triglyceride content in the steatosis model. Upregulation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) protein and sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1) was detected following treatment with GEM. Additionally, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis demonstrated that GEM increased the downstream genes related to PPARα and SREBP1, including carnitine palmitoyltransferase 2, acyl-coA oxidase 1, hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase, LIPIN1 and diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase 1. These findings demonstrated that GEM alleviated hepatic steatosis via the involvement of the PPARα and SREBP1 signaling pathways, which enhances  oxidation and interferes with  synthesis and secretion.

The extraction yield of betacyanins was optimized by response surface methodology. The optimal PHWE conditions were attained and the actual yields of betacyanins under optimal conditions were well matched with the predicted yields. In addition, betacyanin pigment compositions as well as superoxide anion scavenging activity of individual betacyanins extract (BE) produced in optimal PHWE conditions were characterized by HPLC-ESI/MS and cyclic voltammetry.

Fatty  oxidation provides energy to renal tubular cells. Ca is required for mitochondrial ATP production and to decrease reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, how nifedipine (a calcium channel blocker) affects lipogenesis is unknown. We utilized rat NRK52E cells pre-treated with varying concentrations of nifedipine to examine the activity of lipogenesis enzymes and lipotoxicity. A positive control exposed to  was used for comparison. Nifedipine was found to activate acetyl Coenzyme A (CoA) synthetase, acetyl CoA carboxylase, long chain fatty acyl CoA elongase, ATP-citrate lyase, and 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase, suggesting elevated production of cholesterol and phospholipids. Nifedipine exposure induced a vast accumulation of cytosolic free fatty acids (FFA) and stimulated the production of reactive oxygen species, upregulated CD36 and KIM-1 (kidney injury molecule-1) expression, inhibited p-AMPK activity, and triggered the expression of SREBP-1/2 and lipin-1, underscoring the potential of nifedipine to induce lipotoxicity with renal damage.

Daphnetin (DAP) possesses notable antioxidative, anti‑inflammatory and anticoagulant activities; DAP is an active ingredient extracted from Daphne Koreana Nakai. To investigate the effects and the underlying mechanism of DAP on NAFLD, we treated HepG2 cells with  (OA) and DAP simultaneously and non‑simultaneously. In the simultaneous treatment condition, HepG2 cells were co‑treated with 0.5 mM OA and DAP (5, 20, and 50 µM) for 24 h. In the non‑simultaneous treatment conditions, HepG2 cells were pretreated with 0.5 mM OA for 24 h, and then treated with DAP (5, 20 and 50 µM) for 24 h. Following the aforementioned treatments, the biochemical indexes associated with NAFLD were measured as follows: i) The intracellular contents of triglyceride (TG), reactive oxygen species (ROS) and fluorescent glucose 2‑[N‑(7‑nitrobenz‑2‑oxa‑1,3‑diazol‑4‑yl) amino]‑2‑deoxyglucose were analyzed with corresponding detection kits; and ii) the cellular expression levels of glycolipid ‑ and oxidative stress‑related genes, including 5'AMP‑activated protein kinase (AMPK), sterol regulatory element‑binding protein‑1C (SREBP‑1C), patatin‑like phospholipase domain‑containing protein 3 (PNPLA3), peroxisome proliferator‑activated receptor α (PPARα), phosphoinositide 3‑kinase (PI3K), protein kinase B (AKT), nuclear factor‑like 2 (Nrf2), cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2E1 and CYP4A were determined by reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blotting.

Approach and Results: We assessed the effects of exposure to air pollution on  in mice through assessment of plasma lipids and lipoproteins, oxidized fatty acids 9-HODE (9-hydroxyoctadecadienoic) and 13-HODE (13-hydroxyoctadecadienoic), , and carbohydrate . Findings were corroborated, and mechanisms were further assessed in HepG2 hepatocytes in culture. ApoE knockout mice exposed to inhaled diesel exhaust (DE, 6 h/d, 5 days/wk for 16 weeks) exhibited elevated plasma cholesterol and triglyceride levels, increased hepatic triglyceride content, and higher hepatic levels of 9-HODE and 13-HODE, as compared to control mice exposed to filtered air. A direct effect of DE exposure on hepatocytes was demonstrated by treatment of HepG2 cells with a methanol extract of DE particles followed by loading with . As observed in vivo, this led to increased triglyceride content and significant downregulation of ACAD9 mRNA expression. Treatment of HepG2 cells with DE particles and  did not alter de novo lipogenesis but inhibited total, mitochondrial, and ATP-linked oxygen consumption rate, indicative of mitochondrial dysfunction. Treatment of isolated mitochondria, prepared from mouse liver, with DE particles and  also inhibited mitochondrial complex activity and β-oxidation.DE exposure leads to dyslipidemia and liver steatosis in ApoE knockout mice, likely due to mitochondrial dysfunction and decreased  catabolism.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30937936>Morin reduces inflammatory responses and alleviates  accumulation in hepatocytes.</a></h1><p>Morin (MO), a natural bioflavinoid, exists in many herbs. Previous studies have acclaimed MO's anti-inflammatory, antidiabetic, antioxidant, antifibrotic, anticancer, and antihyperglycemic biological effects. This study aimed to assess the molecular mechanism of MO involved in the  (OA)-induced inflammatory damage and  accumulation in HepG2 cell and tyloxapol (Ty)-induced hyperlipidemia in mice. We found that MO can efficaciously mitigate reactive tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) level and triglyceride (TG) accumulation in OA-induced HepG2 cell and in tyloxapol-induced mice. Next, the study testified that MO apparently suppressed OA-excited nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) signaling pathways in HepG2 cell. In addition, MO distinctly upregulated the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) and decreased the expression of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c (SREBP-1c) in OA-induced HepG2 cell and in tyloxapol-induced mice, both of which are dependent upon the phosphorylation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and protein kinase B (AKT). In conclusion, these results suggest that MO has protective potential against hyperlipidemia and steatosis, and the potential mechanism may have a close relation with activation of PPARα and inhibition of SREBP-1c.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30340175>The CCCH-type transcription factor BnZFP1 is a positive regulator to control  levels through the expression of diacylglycerol O-acyltransferase 1 gene in Brassica napus.</a></h1><p>In China, the high- rapeseed has an oil content of ∼42% and  (18:1) content of ∼80%. Compared to ordinary rapeseed, high- rapeseed has higher levels of monounsaturated fatty acids and lower levels of saturated fatty  and polyunsaturated fatty acids, and thus is of high nutritional and health value. In addition, high- rapeseed oil imparts cardiovascular protective effects. Based on these properties, high- oil crops have been extensively investigated and cultivated. We previously identified a CCCH-type transcription factor (BnZFP1, GenBank accession number XM_013796508) that is associated with high  traits from a Brassica napus subtractive hybridization library. In the present study, we overexpressed and silenced the BnZFP1 gene of B. napus. BnZFP1-overexpressing plants exhibited an 18.8% increase in  levels and a 3.8% increase in oil content. However, BNZFP1-silenced plants showed a 4.5% decrease in  levels, whereas no significant change in oil content was observed. Microarray and pull-down assays indicated that BnZFP1 has a total of thirty potential target genes. Further analysis and validation of one of the potential target genes, namely, diacylglycerol O-acyltransferases 1 (DGAT1) gene, indicated that it is positively regulated by BnZFP1. We also observed a correlation between elevated DGAT1 gene expression levels and higher oil content and  levels in rapeseed.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.

C57BL/6 mice were fed a high- diet (HFD; 60 kcal% ) for 14 weeks to induce obesity and were treated with or without LLE (100 or 200  mg/kg daily by oral gavage).HepG2 cells were exposed to 1 mM FFA, with or without LLE (250 - 1000  mg/ml). Intracellular  contents were measured by Oil Red O staining and a Nile Red assay. The body weight, relative liver weight, hepatic lipids, triglycerides (TGs), and total cholesterol (TC) were measured in the mice. Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), TG, TC, glucose, insulin, leptin, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) levels were determined by biochemical or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Histologic analysis was performed in the liver. Western blotting and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction were used to analyze the expression of key enzymes of hepatic .LLE significantly decreased the intracellular  accumulation in FFA-treated HepG2 cells. LLE not only remarkably decreased the expression of lipogenesis genes but also increased β-oxidation in FFA-induced HepG2 cells. In the in vivo study, LLE treatment significantly decreased the body weight, relative liver weight, serum ALT, TC, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, as well as the serum glucose, insulin, leptin, and TNF-α levels in HFD-fed mice. The hepatic TG and TC contents were significantly reduced in the LLE-treated groups. Western blot analysis showed that the expression of sterol-regulatory element-binding protein 1 decreased, while that of phosphorylated AMP-activated protein kinase and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α increased in the LLE-treated mice.These results suggest that LLE may exert protective effects against NAFLD-related obesity and metabolic disease.Copyright © 2018.

In this study, the interaction between  and -I, a marine algal strain, was assessed at metabolic level.In association with an endophytic fungus, the algal biomass enhanced from 471.6 to 704 mg/L, and the fatty  methyl ester (FAME) profile of -I increased substantially. In case of FAME profile of co-cultured -I, two essential components of biodiesel, i.e. elaidic  and , increased by 1.4- and 1.8-fold, respectively. To ascertain changes in the metabolic profile of -I by  co-culture, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS)-based untargeted metabolomics study was performed to identify the metabolites involved; and differential nature of the essential metabolites was also confirmed using HPLC and LC-MS. Significant modulation of the bioactive metabolites such as succinate, oxo-propanoate, l-alanine, glutamate, acetate and 1,2 propanediol, hydroxy butane was observed.The metabolites like glutamate and succinate that usually belong to the GABA shunt pathway were observed to be upregulated. The pathway links nitrogen  and carbon , thus influencing the growth and  profile of the algae. These differential metabolites thus indicated the important commensal association between the endophytic fungus and autotrophic marine alga, and established that endophytic fungus can be handy for the sustainability of algal biofuel industries.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30448348>Channeling of newly synthesized fatty acids to cholesterol esterification limits triglyceride synthesis in SND1-overexpressing hepatoma cells.</a></h1><p>SND1 is a putative oncoprotein whose molecular function remains unclear. Its overexpression in hepatocellular carcinoma impairs cholesterol homeostasis due to the altered activation of the sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) 2, which results in the accumulation of cellular cholesteryl esters (CE). In this work, we explored whether high cholesterol synthesis and esterification originates changes in glycerolipid  that might affect cell growth, given that acetyl-coenzyme A is required for cholesterogenesis and fatty acids (FA) are the substrates of acyl-coenzyme A:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT). SND1-overexpressing hepatoma cells show low triglyceride (TG) synthesis, but phospholipid biosynthesis or cell growth is not affected. Limited TG synthesis is not due to low acetyl-coenzyme A or NADPH availability. We demonstrate that the main factor limiting TG synthesis is the utilization of FAs for cholesterol esterification. These metabolic adaptations are linked to high Scd1 expression, needed for the de novo production of , the main FA used by ACAT. We conclude that high cholesterogenesis due to SND1 overexpression might determine the channeling of FAs to CEs.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

However, lipotoxicity is indicated in GLP-1 secreting cells following long-term exposure to elevated levels of saturated FAs (SFAs) in vivo and in vitro, where in vitro studies indicate that cosupplementation with MUFAs confers lipoprotection. SFAs and MUFAs differentially affect the fate of cells in ways that depend on the cell type, concentration and ratio of the FAs. The present study was designed to further elucidate the mechanisms underlying the effects of SFAs/MUFAs on GLP-1-producing cells in terms of lipotoxicity/lipoprotection and GLP-1 secretion.Cultured GLP-1 secreting cells were exposed to hyperlipidemia simulated by SFA-albumin complexes where the molar ratio was 2:1. The cellular response to simulated hyperlipidemia was assessed in the presence/absence of MUFA cosupplementation by determining intracellular ceramide, ROS, neutral  accumulation, and cellular respiration. The role for cellular respiration in GLP-1 secretion in response to SFAs/MUFAs was assessed.Generation of intracellular ceramide mediate a detrimental increased in ROS production following long term exposure to SFAs in GLP-1-secreting cells. Cosupplementation with MUFAs increases cellular respiration, triglyceride synthesis, and the expression of ceramide kinase, while reducing ceramide synthesis and attenuating ROS production, caspase-3 activity and DNA fragmentation. Further, acute secretory effects of unsaturated FAs are independent of FAO, but mediated by a FFAR1 induced increase in cellular respiration.This study demonstrates novel data supporting effects of MUFAs on the ceramide biosynthetic pathway, triglyceride storage respiration and secretion in GLP-1 secreting cells. These findings may be of value for nutritional interventions, as well as for identification of novel targets, to help preserve L-cell mass and potentiate GLP-1 secretion in diabesity.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V. and Société Française de Biochimie et Biologie Moléculaire (SFBBM).

The isoprenoid farnesol (FOH) modulates  and reduces hepatic TG content in rodents. This effect involves activation of at least two nuclear receptors, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) and farnesoid X receptor. We evaluated the effects of FOH (100 μM) in a cellular model of human hepatic steatosis by loading hepatocyte-like HepaRG cells with  (OA, 0.66 mM). FOH treatment decreased OA-induced TG accumulation by ~25%. Using PCR arrays, we found that FOH treatment modulated the mRNA levels of several -metabolizing enzymes, both alone and when cells were loaded with OA. While FOH activated PPARα and the constitutive androstane receptor (CAR), most of the FOH-mediated effects on -metabolizing genes could be attributed to activation of PPARα. In OA-loaded HepaRG cells, FOH increased fatty  oxidation, which was accompanied by up-regulation of PPARα target genes involved in mitochondrial fatty  oxidation, including hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase/3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase/enoyl-CoA hydratase and acetyl-coenzyme A acyltransferase 2. These effects on gene expression were lost when the cells were co-treated with the PPARα antagonist, GW6471. OA treatment alone decreased the mRNA levels of the drug-metabolizing enzymes, cytochrome P450 (CYP)1A2, 2B6, and 3A4, and increased CYP2E1 expression, all of which were attenuated by FOH co-treatment. These findings show that FOH treatment increases fatty  oxidation and decreases TG accumulation in steatotic HepaRG cells, which is likely attributable to PPARα-mediated induction of mitochondrial fatty  oxidation.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

One such factor is the potentially atherogenic effect of lead (Pb) on , and is significant in view of the still considerable Pb environmental pollution and the non-degradability of Pb compounds.Analysis of saturated fatty acids (SFA) (caprylic  (C8:0), decanoic  (C10:0), lauric  (C12:0), tridecanoic  (C13:0), myristic  (C14:0), pentadecanoic  (C15:0), palmitic  (C16:0), heptadecanoic  (C17:0), stearic  (C18:0), and behenic  (C22:0)), monounsaturated fatty  (MUFA) (palmitoleic  (C16:1),  (18:1w9), trans-vaccenic  (C18:1 trans11)), and polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA) (linoleic  (C18:2n6), gamma-linolenic  (C18:3n6), arachidonic  (C20:4n6)), was conducted by gas chromatography. Analysis of stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD), fatty  desaturase 1 (FADS1) and fatty  desaturase 2 (FADS2) expression was performed using qRT-PCR. Oxidative stress intensity (malondialdehyde - MDA concentration) was measured using spectrophotometric method. Intracellular generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in macrophages was visualized by fluorescence microscopy and quantitatively measured by plate reader.Pb caused quantitative alterations in FAs profile in macrophages; the effect was Pb-concentration dependent and selective (i.e. concerned only selected FAs). In general, the effect of Pb was biphasic, with Pb levels of 1.25 μg/dL and 2.5 μg/dL being stimulatory, and 10 μg/dL being inhibitory on concentrations of selected FAs. The most potent Pb concentration, resulting in increase in levels of 9 FAs, was 2.5 μg/dL, the Pb-level corresponding to the mean blood Pb concentrations of people living in urban areas not contaminated by Pb. Pb was found to exert similar, biphasic effect on the expression of FADS1. However, Pb decreased, in a concentration-dependent manner, the expression of SCD and FADS2. Pb significantly increased MDA and ROS concentration in macrophages.Environmental Pb exposure might be a risk factor resulting in alterations in FAs levels, oxidative stress and increased MDA concentration in macrophages, which might lead to the formation of foam cells and to inflammatory reactions.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier GmbH.

However, the role of LDs in fish immunity remains poorly understood. In this study, the function of LDs in the innate immune response of Ctenopharyngodon idella kidney (CIK) cells, which are the equivalent of myeloid cells in vertebrates, was investigated. LD number and TG content significantly increased in the CIK cells following exposure to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), peptidoglycan (PGN), and polyriboinosinic-polyribocytidylic  (Poly [I: C]) for 24 h, accompanied by increases in the relative expression of several innate immune genes. However, fatty  compositions of the triglycerides were not changed after treatment with these three pathogenic mimics. LPS, PGN, and Poly (I: C) did not alter the relative expressions of lipogenic (FAS, SCD, and DGAT) and  catabolic (PPARα, ATGL, and CPT-1) genes. However, these treatments did increase the mRNA levels of  transportation genes (FATP/CD36, ACSL1, and ACSL4), and also decreased the non-esterified fatty  level in the medium. To further explore the role of LDs in the immune response, CIK cells were incubated with different concentrations (0, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500 μM) of exogenous  mix (LM;  [OA]:linoleic  [LA]:linolenic  [LNA] = 2:1:1), and were then transferred to a -free medium and incubated for 24 h. LD size and number increased with the increase in  levels, and this was accompanied by increased expression of innate immune genes, including MyD88, IRF3, and IL-1β, which were expressed at their highest levels in 300 μM exogenous  mix. Interestingly, after incubating with different fatty acids (LM, OA, LA, LNA, arachidonic  [ARA], and docosahexaenoic  [DHA]; 300 μM), ARA and DHA were more potent in inducing LD formation and innate immune gene expression in the CIK cells. Finally, atglistatin, an ATGL inhibitor, effectively attenuated the expression of most genes upregulated by ARA or DHA, suggesting that lipolysis may be involved in the regulation of immune genes at the transcriptional level. Overall, the findings of this study demonstrate that LDs are functional organelles that could act as modulators in the innate immune response of CIK cells. Additionally, long-chain polyunsaturated fatty  enriched LDs play a unique role in regulating this process.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

In the present study, the parental and IDH1 (R132H/+) mutant HCT116 cells were treated with various concentrations of  (OA) or palmitic  (PA) in the presence or absence of glucose. The results demonstrated that mutation of IDH1 exacerbated the effects of OA and PA on cell viability and apoptosis, and consistently elevated the production of reactive oxygen species in HCT116 cells, particularly in the absence of glucose. Furthermore, mutation of IDH1 inhibited the rate of fatty  oxidation (FAO), but elevated the glucose consumption in HCT116 cells. The results of immunoblotting and reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT‑qPCR) indicated that the expression of glucose transporter 1 was upregulated, whereas that of carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1 was downregulated in IDH1 mutant HCT116 cells. Although mitochondrial DNA quantification demonstrated that mutation of IDH1 had no effect on the quantity of mitochondria, immunoblotting and RT‑qPCR revealed that mutation of IDH1 in HCT116 cells significantly downregulated the expression of cytochrome c (CYCS) and CYCS oxidase IV, two important components in mitochondrial respiratory chain. These results indicated that mutation of IDH1 aggravated the fatty ‑induced oxidative stress in HCT116 cells, by suppressing FAO and disrupting the mitochondrial respiratory chain. The results of the present study may provide novel insight into therapeutic strategies for the treatment of cancer types with IDH mutation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30692006>Short communication: Changes under low ambient temperatures in the milk lipodome and metabolome of mid-lactation cows after dehorning as a calf.</a></h1><p>Horns are living tissue and cows can use their horns for thermoregulatory purposes. We investigated the effect of the presence of horns on the metabolome of milk serum and lipidome of milk , to assess the physiological effect of dehorning. Milk sampling took place at low ambient temperatures of -6 to 2°C. Horned and dehorned cows were kept in a mixed herd of Holstein Friesian and Brown Swiss cows. The hypothesis was that horned cows needed to increase their  to compensate for additional heat loss through the presence of their horns. No differences were observed in milk yield, milk solids, and somatic cell counts between horned and dehorned cows. For the milk metabolome, horned cows showed an upregulation of several glucogenic AA that could be transformed into glucose for energy supply and a downregulation of sugar intermediates and γ-glutamylcysteine compared with dehorned cows. The fatty  (FA) composition in horned cows showed a shift toward decreased odd medium-chain FA (C7:0, C9:0, and C11:0) and increased cis-vaccenic  (C18:1n-7 cis-11) and stearidonic  (C18:4n-3).

However, the lack of effective research approaches impedes the understanding of the protein-metabolite interactions. In this study, a novel comprehensive strategy by combining metabolomics platform with native mass spectrometry was developed for investigating the protein-metabolite interactions. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors gamma (PPARγ) is a -binding nuclear receptors that plays a key role in regulating fatty- oxidation and , which was selected as the model protein. Seven metabolites including lyso-phosphatidylcholine (LPC) 16:0, LPC18:0, LPC18:1, arachidonic , , linoleic  and palmitoleic  (p < 0.05) were found to have the possible interactions with the PPARγ, these LPCs were discovered as candidate ligands for the first time by using untargeted metabolomics method. Native mass spectrometry based on 15 T Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometer was employed to directly detect the PPARγ-LPCs complexes to obtain their stoichiometry and kinetic constants. Isothermal titration calorimetry, circular dichroism spectrum and molecular modeling were further utilized to investigate the thermodynamics, conformation and binding mechanism of the interaction between PPARγ and LPCs. It was found that the PPARγ-LPC interaction was an endothermic process, and these LPCs have similar binding constants with stoichiometric number of 1:1. The novel strategy can provide a very useful approach for mapping and identifying unknown protein-metabolite interactions in biological systems.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.
