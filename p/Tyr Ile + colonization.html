<html><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2735766>Identification of a second active site in laminin for promotion of cell adhesion and migration and inhibition of in vivo melanoma lung .</a></h2><p>Previously we reported that a pentapeptide (--Gly-Ser-Arg or YIGSR) from domain III of the B1 chain of laminin is a cell attachment site with the ability to stimulate cell adhesion and migration and to block experimental metastases. Here we report studies on the activities of synthetic peptides that cover domain III and report a second biologically active peptide PDSGR from this domain with activities similar to YIGSR. We also show that cyclic YIGSR is more potent in these assays than the linear peptide as expected since this sequence on laminin is bracketed by cysteines. Due to their proximity and similar spectrum of activities, it is possible that these sequences act in concert in the native laminin molecule.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8979501>Synthetic peptides related to laminin pentapeptide (YIGSR) fragment.</a></h2><p>The synthetic laminin pentapeptide amide fragment (LF), --Gly-Ser-Arg-NH2 corresponding to a part of B1 chain of the glycoprotein, laminin, and six of its analogues having structural modifications at positions 1, 3 and 4 were synthesized by solid phase method employing mainly 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl-amino acid trichlorophenyl esters as coupling agents and Merrifield resin as the solid support. Their biological activities were studied in vivo by lung tumor  assay and in vitro by cell adhesion assay. The activity of synthetic LF was found to correlate with the earlier reported results in both in vivo and in vitro assays. Among the analogues made, [Tyr4] LF and [Thr4]LF were found to inhibit the lung tumor colonies more efficiently than LF itself in the in vivo assay whereas [D- Ser4]LF exhibited almost the same inhibition as LF.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22129598>Development of angiotensin IV analogs as hepatocyte growth factor/Met modifiers.</a></h2><p>The 6-AH family [D-Nle-X--NH-(CH(2))(5)-CONH(2); where X = various amino acids] of angiotensin IV (Ang IV) analogs binds directly to hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and inhibit HGF's ability to form functional dimers. The metabolically stabilized 6-AH family member, D-Nle---NH-(CH(2))(5)-CONH(2,) had a t(1/2) in blood of 80 min compared with the parent compound norleual [Nle--Leu-Î¨-(CH(2)-NH(2))(3-4)-His-Pro-Phe], which had a t(1/2) in blood of <5 min. 6-AH family members were found to act as mimics of the dimerization domain of HGF (hinge region) and inhibited the interaction of an HGF molecule with a (3)H-hinge region peptide resulting in an attenuated capacity of HGF to activate its receptor Met. This interference translated into inhibition of HGF-dependent signaling, proliferation, and scattering in multiple cell types at concentrations down into the low picomolar range. We also noted a significant correlation between the ability of the 6-AH family members to block HGF dimerization and inhibition of the cellular activity. Furthermore, a member of the 6-AH family with cysteine at position 2, was a particularly effective antagonist of HGF-dependent cellular activities. This compound suppressed pulmonary  by B16-F10 murine melanoma cells, which are characterized by an overactive HGF/Met system. Together, these data indicate that the 6-AH family of Ang IV analogs exerts its biological activity by modifying the activity of the HGF/Met system and offers the potential as therapeutic agents in disorders that are dependent on or possess an overactivation of the HGF/Met system.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10413621>Molecular phylogenetics, tRNA evolution, and historical biogeography in anguid lizards and related taxonomic families.</a></h2><p>Phylogenetic relationships among lizards of the families Anguidae, Anniellidae, Xenosauridae, and Shinisauridae are investigated using 2001 aligned bases of mitochondrial DNA sequence from the genes encoding ND1 (subunit one of NADH dehydrogenase), tRNA(), tRNA(Gln), tRNA(Met), ND2, tRNA(Trp), tRNA(Ala), tRNA(Asn), tRNA(Cys), tRNA(), and COI (subunit I of cytochrome c oxidase), plus the origin for light-strand replication (O(L)) between the tRNA(Asn) and the tRNA(Cys) genes. The aligned sequences contain 1013 phylogenetically informative characters. A well-resolved phylogenetic hypothesis is obtained. Because monophyly of the family Xenosauridae (Shinisaurus and Xenosaurus) is statistically rejected, we recommend placing Shinisaurus in a separate family, the Shinisauridae. The family Anniellidae and the anguid subfamilies Gerrhonotinae and Anguinae each form monophyletic groups receiving statistical support. The Diploglossinae*, which appears monophyletic, is retained as a metataxon (denoted with an asterisk) because its monophyly is statistically neither supported nor rejected. The family Anguidae appears monophyletic in analyses of the DNA sequence data, and statistical support for its monophyly is provided by reanalysis of previously published allozymic data. Anguid lizards appear to have had a northern origin in Laurasia. Taxa currently located on Gondwanan plates arrived there by dispersal from the north in two separate events, one from the West Indies to South America and another from a Laurasian plate to Morocco. Because basal anguine lineages are located in western Eurasia and Morocco, formation of the Atlantic Ocean (late Eocene) is implicated in the separation of the Anguinae from its North American sister taxon, the Gerrhonotinae. Subsequent dispersal of anguine lizards to East Asia and North America appears to have followed the Oligocene drying of the Turgai Sea. The alternative hypothesis, that anguine lizards originated in North America and dispersed to Asia via the Bering land bridge with subsequent  of Europe and Morocco, requires a phylogenetic tree seven steps longer than the most parsimonious hypothesis. North African, European, and West Asian anguines were isolated from others by the rapid uplift of Tibet in the late Oligocene to Miocene. Phylogenetic analysis of evolutionary changes in the gene encoding tRNA(Cys) suggests gradual reduction of dihydrouridine (D) stems by successive deletion of bases in some lineages. This evolutionary pattern contrasts with the one observed for parallel elimination of the D-stem in mitochondrial tRNAs of eight other reptile groups, in which replication slippage produces direct repeats. An unusual, enlarged TpsiC (T) stem is inferred for tRNA(Cys) in most species.Copyright 1999 Academic Press.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8506527>Inhibition of tumor cell adhesion to lymph nodes by laminin-related peptide and neuraminidase.</a></h2><p>Adhesion to lymph nodes, rather than growth stimulation, accounted for preferential  of lymph nodes by a metastatic B16 melanoma. We investigated these adhesive interactions.Four classes of molecules were tested for inhibition of melanoma adhesion to cryostat sections of lymph node.Calcium chelators ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid and ethyleneglycol-bis-(beta-aminoethylether)-N,N,N',N'-tetra ace tic acid completely inhibited adhesion (50% adhesion, half-maximal inhibition, at 1 to 3 mmol/L). Cytochalasin B, which impairs contractile microfilaments, inhibited adhesion (60% adhesion at .001 mmol/L, 28% at .01 mmol/L). Colchicine, which disaggregates microtubules, had a similar effect (20% at .01 mmol/L, lowest dose tested). Trypsin slightly increased adhesion (125% adhesion at 10 micrograms/ml). Neuraminidase, which removed sialic acid residues, inhibited it (50% adhesion at 5 micrograms/ml). Gly-arg-gly-asp-ser, a peptide with a cell binding sequence of fibronectin, did not consistently inhibit adhesion (69% adhesion at 0.1 mg/ml, 83% adhesion at 1 mg/ml) or substantially differ from gly-arg-gly-glu-ser-pro (59% adhesion at 0.1 mg/ml, 90% adhesion at 1 mg/ml). In contrast, a peptide with a cell binding region of laminin (--gly-ser-arg) inhibited adhesion (50% adhesion at .05 mg/ml).Tumor cell-lymph node adhesion is a calcium-dependent process, requiring a functional cytoskeleton, that is mediated by both sialic acid moieties and trypsin-resistant, laminin-related, adhesion molecules.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20086056>The angiotensin IV analog Nle--Leu-psi-(CH2-NH2)3-4-His-Pro-Phe (norleual) can act as a hepatocyte growth factor/c-Met inhibitor.</a></h2><p>The angiotensin (Ang) IV analog norleual [Nle--Leu-psi-(CH2-NH2)(3-4)-His-Pro-Phe] exhibits structural homology with the hinge (linker) region of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and is hypothesized to act as a hinge region mimic. Norleual competitively inhibited the binding of HGF to its receptor c-Met in mouse liver membranes, with an IC(50) value of 3 pM. Predictably, norleual was able to inhibit HGF-dependent signaling, proliferation, migration, and invasion in multiple cell types at concentrations in the picomolar range. Ex vivo studies demonstrated that norleual exhibited potent antiangiogenic activity, an attribute that would be predicted for a HGF/c-Met antagonist. Furthermore, norleual suppressed pulmonary  by B16-F10 murine melanoma cells, which are characterized by an overactive HGF/c-Met system. Together, these data suggest that AngIV analogs exert at least some of their biological activity through interference with the HGF/c-Met system and may have utility as therapeutic agents in disorders that are dependent on an intact HGF/c-Met system. Finally, the ability of norleual to induce marked biological responses in human embryonic kidney cells, which do not express insulin-responsive aminopeptidase (IRAP), coupled with the observed effects of norleual on the HGF/c-Met system, casts doubt on the physiological significance of AngIV-dependent inhibition of IRAP.

Since laminin is present in the perisinusoidal matrix of the liver, we studied its effects on liver  by human colon cancer cells (HM7, LiM6) previously shown to have liver-metastasizing ability in athymic mice. These malignant cells expressed high levels of a 32-kDa laminin-binding protein on Western blot analysis when compared to the low metastatic parental cell line. Coinjection of laminin alpha chain-derived peptides which contain the amino acid sequence -Lys-Val-Ala-Val (IKVAV) significantly stimulated liver  as determined by liver weight (P < 0.005) and number of tumor nodules (P < 0.02) 3 weeks after splenic-portal inoculation into nude mice. No stimulation was seen with a control peptide containing the same amino acids but in a scrambled sequence. In contrast, the --Gly-Ser-Arg peptide from the laminin beta 1 chain significantly inhibited HM7 liver . These differences were not due to alterations in the number of cells initially reaching the liver as determined by injection of [125I]iododeoxyuridine-labeled tumor cells, but retention in the liver was stimulated by the IKVAV-containing peptides. Flow analysis indicated that the IKVAV peptide may act, in part, by stimulating homotypic adhesion of tumor cells. These data suggest that interactions of colon cancer cells with the IKVAV site on laminin may play a role in the formation of metastatic foci in the liver through cell-cell or cell-substratum interactions which promote metastasis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9921265>[Identification of biologically active sites in laminin an extracellular matrix protein].</a></h2><p>Laminin-1, a major component of basement membranes, has multiple biological activities including promotion of cell adhesion, spreading, migration, growth, neurite outgrowth and tumor metastasis. Several active sites on laminin-1 have been identified previously. We modified these biologically active peptides to enhance their activities. The multimeric YIGSR (--Gly-Ser-Arg) peptides assembled on a branched lysine core were found to strongly enhance the activity of YIGSR in inhibiting tumor growth and metastasis. We also found the all-D-configuration peptide segment containing the IKVAV (-Lys-Val-Ala-Val) sequence had similar biological activities to the native all-L-peptide in vitro and in vivo. These results suggest that these modified compounds are potentially useful for clinical applications. We have identified new active sequences from the laminin alpha 1 chain carboxyl-terminal globular domain (G domain). Using a systematic screening for cell binding sites with 113 overlapping synthetic peptides, we found five peptides (AG-10, AG-22, AG-32, AG-56, and AG-73) showed cell attachment activities with cell-type specificities. AG-10 and AG-32 were found to interact with integrins. AG-73 caused metastases of B16-F10 mouse melanoma cells to the liver  in mice. Additionally AG-73 was found to promote neurite outgrowth. Moreover, this peptide inhibited laminin mediated acinar-like development of a human submandibular gland cell line. The AG-73 domain on laminin-1 could be one of the most important biologically active sites. These active peptides may useful for study of the molecular mechanism of laminin-receptor interactions and for development of therapeutic reagents for tumor metastasis and angiogenasis.</p></html>
