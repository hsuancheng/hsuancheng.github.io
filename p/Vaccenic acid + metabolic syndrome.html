<html><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25860656>Serum metabolomics study of polycystic ovary syndrome based on UPLC-QTOF-MS coupled with a pattern recognition approach.</a></h2><p>Metabolomics has become an important tool in distinguishing changes in metabolic pathways and the diagnosis of human disease. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a relatively complicated, heterogeneous endocrine disorder. The etiology and pathogenesis of PCOS remain uncertain. In this study, based on the platform of ultra performance liquid chromatography tandem quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-QTOF-MS) and the method of pattern recognition, a comprehensive metabolomics approach has been applied to explore the changes in metabolic profiling between PCOS patients (n = 20) and controls (n = 15) as well as insulin-resistance (IR) PCOS patients (n = 11) and non-IR PCOS subjects (n = 9) in serum. In total, 36 metabolites were found significantly different between PCOS and controls, and 9 metabolites were discovered significantly different between IR and non-IR PCOS patients. Significant increases in the levels of saturated and unsaturated  acids (myristic acid, linoleic acid, 9-/13-HODE, etc.),  amides (palmitic amide, oleamide), dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, L-glutamic acid, azelaic acid, L-glyceric acid, pyroglutamic acid, and decreases in the levels of lysophosphatidylethanolamine, lysophosphatidylcholine, uridine, and L-carnitine were found in PCOS patients compared with controls. In IR PCOS patients, linoleic acid, myristic acid, palmitoleic acid, and  also increased significantly compared with non-IR PCOS patients. All these changed metabolites showed abnormalities of steroid hormone biosynthesis, amino acids and nucleosides metabolism, glutathione metabolism, and lipids and carbohydrates metabolism in PCOS patients. The subgroup IR PCOS patients exhibited greater metabolic deviations than non-IR PCOS patients. These findings may help yield promising insights into the pathogenesis and advance the diagnosis and prevention of PCOS.

We investigated whether VA could influence tissue endocannabinoids (ECs) by altering the availability of their biosynthetic precursor, arachidonic acid (AA), in membrane phospholipids (PLs). JCR:LA-cprats were assigned to a control diet with or without VA (1% w/w),cis-9,trans-11 conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) (1% w/w) or VA+CLA (1% + 0.5% w/w) for 8 weeks. VA reduced the EC, 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), in the  and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) relative to control diet (P< 0.001), but did not change AA in tissue PLs. There was no additive effect of combining VA+CLA on 2-AG relative to VA alone (P> 0.05). Interestingly, VA increased jejunal concentrations of anandamide and those of the noncannabinoid signaling molecules, oleoylethanolamide and palmitoylethanolamide, relative to control diet (P< 0.05). This was consistent with a lower jejunal protein abundance (but not activity) of their degrading enzyme,  acid amide hydrolase, as well as the mRNA expression of TNFα and interleukin 1β (P< 0.05). The ability of VA to reduce 2-AG in the  and VAT provides a potential mechanistic explanation to alleviate ectopic lipid accumulation. The opposing regulation of ECs and other noncannabinoid lipid signaling molecules by VA suggests an activation of benefit via the EC system in the intestine.Copyright © 2016 by the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28298293>Discovery and fine-mapping of loci associated with MUFAs through trans-ethnic meta-analysis in Chinese and European populations.</a></h2><p>MUFAs are unsaturated FAs with one double bond and are derived from endogenous synthesis and dietary intake. Accumulating evidence has suggested that plasma and erythrocyte MUFA levels are associated with cardiometabolic disorders, including CVD, T2D, and  (MS). Previous genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified seven loci for plasma and erythrocyte palmitoleic and oleic acid levels in populations of European origin. To identify additional MUFA-associated loci and the potential functional variant at each locus, we performed ethnic-specific GWAS meta-analyses and trans-ethnic meta-analyses in more than 15,000 participants of Chinese and European ancestry. We identified novel genome-wide significant associations for  at  and  [log(Bayes factor) ≥ 8.07] and for gondoic acid at  and  [log(Bayes factor) ≥ 6.22], and also observed improved fine-mapping resolutions at  and  loci. The greatest improvement was observed at , where the number of variants in the 99% credible set was reduced from 16 (covering 94.8 kb) to 5 (covering 19.6 kb, including a missense variant rs1260326) after trans-ethnic meta-analysis. We also confirmed the previously reported associations of , , , and  with palmitoleic acid and of  and  with oleic acid in the Chinese-specific GWAS and the trans-ethnic meta-analyses. Pathway-based analyses suggested that the identified loci were in unsaturated FA metabolism and signaling pathways. Our findings provide novel insight into the genetic basis relevant to MUFA metabolism and biology.Copyright © 2017 by the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25702712>Structure and reaction mechanism of a novel enone reductase.</a></h2><p>Recently, a novel gut-bacterial  acid metabolism, saturation of polyunsaturated  acid, that modifies  acid composition of the host and is expected to improve our health by altering lipid metabolism related to the onset of metabolic syndrome, was discovered in Lactobacillus plantarum AKU 1009a. Enzymes constituting the pathway catalyze sequential reactions of free  acids without CoA or acyl carrier protein. Among these enzymes, CLA-ER was identified as an enone reductase that can saturate the C=C bond in the 10-oxo-trans- (KetoB) to produce 10-oxo-octadecanoic acid (KetoC). This enzyme is the sole member of the NADH oxidase/flavin reductase family that has been identified to exert an enone reduction activity. Here, we report both the structure of holo CLA-ER with cofactor FMN and the KetoC-bound structure, which elucidate the structural basis of enone group recognition of free  acids and provide the unique catalytic mechanism as an enone reductase in the NADH oxidase/flavin reductase family. A 'cap' structure of CLA-ER underwent a large conformational change upon KetoC binding. The resulting binding site adopts a sandglass shape and is positively charged at one side, which is suitable to recognize a  acid molecule with enone group. Based on the crystal structures and enzymatic activities of several mutants, we identified C51, F126 and Y101 as the critical residues for the reaction and proposed an alternative electron transfer pathway of CLA-ER. These findings expand our understanding of the complexity of  acid metabolism.The atomic coordinates have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB), www.pdb.org (PDB ID 4QLX, 4QLY).© 2015 FEBS.</p></html>
