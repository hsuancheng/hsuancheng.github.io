This study was designed to cause follicle depletion in mice using the industrial chemical,  diepoxide (VCD), and characterize the steroidogenic capacity of cells in the residual ovarian tissue. From a dose-finding study, the optimal daily concentration of VCD was determined to be 160 mg/kg. Female B6C3F(1) immature mice were treated daily with vehicle control or VCD (160 mg kg(-1) day(-1), 15 days, i.p.). Ovaries were removed and processed for histological evaluation. On Day 15 following onset of treatment, primordial follicles were depleted and primary follicles were reduced to about 10% of controls. On Day 46, primary follicles were depleted and secondary and antral follicles were reduced to 0.7% and 2.6% of control, respectively. Seventy-five percent of treated mice displayed disruptions in estrous cyclicity. All treated mice were in persistent diestrus (acyclic) by Day 58. Plasma FSH levels were increased (P < 0.05) relative to controls on Day 37 and had plateaued by Day 100. Relative to age-matched cyclic controls, by Day 127, the significant differences in VCD-treated mice included reduced ovarian and uterine weights, elevated plasma LH and FSH, and reduced plasma progesterone and androstenedione. Furthermore, plasma 17beta-estradiol levels were nondetectable. Unlike controls, immunostaining for LH receptor, and the high density lipoprotein receptor (SR-BI), was diffuse in ovarian sections from VCD-treated animals. Ovaries from Day 120 control and VCD-treated animals were dissociated and dispersed cells were placed in culture. Cultured cells from ovaries of VCD-treated animals produced less LH-stimulated progesterone than control cells. Androstenedione production was nondetectable in cells from cyclic control animals. Conversely, cells from VCD-treated animals produced androstenedione that was doubled in the presence of insulin and LH (1 and 3 ng/ml). Collectively, these data demonstrate that VCD-mediated follicle depletion results in residual ovarian tissue that may be analogous to the follicle-deplete postmenopausal ovary. This may serve as a useful animal model to examine the dynamics of follicle loss in women as ovarian senescence ensues.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11488405>Evaluation of hepatic cytochrome P4502E1 in the species-dependent bioactivation of .</a></h2><p>4-Vinyl-1-cyclohexene (VCH), is converted by multiple forms of cytochrome P450 (CYP) to two monoepoxides (4-vinyl-1-cyclohexene 1,2-epoxide [VCH-1,2-epoxide], 4-vinyl-1-cyclohexene 7,8-epoxide [VCH-7,8-epoxide]), and 4-vinyl-1-cyclohexene diepoxide (VCD). A greater degree of formation of these epoxides by female B6C3F1 mice as compared to Fischer 344 rats correlates with the ovarian toxicity observed only in the mice. Understanding which isoforms of CYP are involved in VCH bioactivation will better explain the species-dependent ovotoxicity of VCH. Present studies focus on the role of CYP2E1, as this isoform is responsible for the bioactivation of several structurally related small molecular weight compounds, including 1,3-butadiene. Hepatic microsomes prepared from either mice or rats pretreated with the CYP inducer acetone demonstrated 2-fold increases in the formation of VCH-1,2-epoxide. However, incubations with microsomes from cyp2e1-deficient mice compared to those from wild type mice revealed no differences in the rates of bioactivation of VCH to the monoepoxides. Since repeated exposure to VCH is required for VCH-induced ovotoxicity, rodents were dosed with VCH for 5 or 10 d to observe effects on the hepatic concentration of CYP2E1 and/or associated activities. VCH pretreatment failed to increase the concentration of CYP2E1 or CYP2E1 activity in either species, as measured by immunoblotting analysis and p-nitrophenol hydroxylation. Based on these data, it is concluded that CYP2E1 does not play a role in the species differences between mice and rats in the bioactivation of VCH following repeated exposure to VCH. Other isoforms, such as those in CYP2A and CYP2B subfamilies, are likely involved in VCH bioactivation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18706995>Correlation of serum anti-Müllerian hormone with accelerated follicle loss following  diepoxide-induced follicle loss in mice.</a></h2><p>A chemically induced model of ovarian failure has been developed in rodents, and was used to test whether or not anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) can be used as a non-invasive measure of primordial follicle numbers. Repeated exposures of mice to  diepoxide (VCD) induce loss of primordial and earliest growing ovarian follicles. An accelerated exposure regimen was used to eliminate small ovarian follicles in C57BL6/J mice (240mg VCD/kg/day, 5 days, i.p.). Follicle populations were determined and correlated with circulating AMH levels. Exposures decreased only primordial and small primary follicles by 96% on day 16 after initiating exposures, followed by almost complete follicle elimination on days 37-100. AMH levels in VCD-exposed mice were similar to vehicle-treated mice on day 16, but became significantly lower or undetectable at later time points. Thus, AMH correlated well with growing follicle numbers. AMH only correlated with primordial follicles at time points after ovarian insult at which their loss led to decreased growing follicle numbers.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16735946>Effect of duration of dosing on onset of ovarian failure in a chemical-induced mouse model of perimenopause.</a></h2><p>Repeated daily dosing with  diepoxide (VCD) causes gradual ovarian failure in mice. As a result, the animal undergoes ovarian failure, but retains residual ovarian tissue. The purpose of this study was to use a mouse model to regulate the induction of a period analogous to perimenopause in women.Female B6C3F1 mice (28 days old; n = 8) were dosed daily for 10 or 20 days with VCD (160 mg/kg/d) or sesame oil. The animals were evaluated for reproductive function on days 10, 20, 35 after the onset of dosing, and on the day of follicle depletion. Each animal was killed at the specified time points, and ovaries, uteri, and plasma were collected.VCD reduced (P < 0.05) the number of primordial (by 93.2%) and primary (by 85.1%) follicles after 10 days of dosing, whereas essentially all primordial and primary follicles were lost (P < 0.05) after 20 days of dosing. The average time to ovarian failure was on day 135 for 10-day-dosed mice and on day 52 for 20-day-dosed mice. Follicle-depleted mice in both groups had decreased (P < 0.05) ovarian and uterine weights. Circulating follicle-stimulating hormone levels were increased (P < 0.05) on day 44 after the onset of dosing in 10-day-dosed mice and on day 35 in 20-day-dosed mice.These results demonstrate that ovarian failure can be caused by VCD more rapidly if repeated daily dosing occurs for a longer period. Thus, the length of time leading up to ovarian failure (model for perimenopause) can be adjusted by varying the length of exposure.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18448842>Involvement of the KIT/KITL signaling pathway in  diepoxide-induced ovarian follicle loss in rats.</a></h2><p>Repeated daily dosing of rats with the occupational chemical  diepoxide (VCD) depletes the ovary of primordial and primary follicles through an increase in the natural process of atresia. Additionally, in vitro exposure of Postnatal Day 4 (PND 4) rat ovaries to VCD causes similar follicular depletion. This study was designed to investigate survival signaling  that may be associated with VCD-induced ovotoxicity in small preantral follicles. Female Fischer 344 rats (PND 28) were dosed daily (80 mg/kg/day VCD i.p.; 12 days in vivo), and PND 4 ovaries were cultured (VCD 20 or 30 microM; 8 days in vitro). Microarray analysis identified a subset of 14 genes whose expression was increased or decreased by VCD in both experiments (i.e., via both exposure routes). Particularly, the analysis showed that relative to controls, VCD did not affect mRNA expression of growth and differentiation factor 9 (Gdf9), whereas there were decreases in mRNA encoding bone morphogenic protein receptor 1a (Bmpr1a) and Kit. To confirm findings from microarray, the genes Gdf9, Bmpr1a, and Kit were further examined. When growth factors associated with these  were added to ovarian cultures during VCD exposure, GDF9 and BMP4 had no effect on VCD-induced ovotoxicity; however, KITL attenuated this follicle loss. Additionally, there was a decrease in Kit and an increase in Kitl expression (mRNA and protein) following VCD exposure, relative to control. These results support that VCD compromises KIT/KITL signaling, which is critical for follicular survival in primordial and primary follicles.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17342769>Development of an animal model for ovotoxicity using : a case study.</a></h2><p>The occupational chemical  (VCH) has been shown to cause destruction of small pre-antral follicles in ovaries of mice. Further, its monoepoxide metabolites, 1,2-VCH epoxide, 7,8-VCH epoxide, and the diepoxide, VCD, have been shown to cause pre-antral follicle loss in rats as well as mice. Chemicals that destroy small pre-antral follicles are of concern to women because exposure can result in premature ovarian failure (early menopause).Studies working with these chemicals over the past decade have determined a number of aspects of the mechanism(s) of small pre-antral destruction, and a variety of questions have been answered.Specifically, it has been determined that the diepoxide (VCD) is the bioactive form and it directly targets the ovary in mice and rats. Mice are more susceptible to VCH than rats because they are capable of its  bioactivation. Follicle destruction by VCD is selective for primordial and primary follicles. Mechanistic studies in rats have determined that VCD causes ovotoxicity by accelerating the natural process of atresia (apoptosis) and this requires repeated exposures. Pro-apoptotic signaling events in the Bcl-2 and mitogen activated protein kinase families have been shown to be selectively activated in fractions of small pre-antral follicles (targets for VCD). Finally, a whole ovarian culture system using neonatal mouse and rat ovaries has been developed to expand the potential for more in depth investigations into ovotoxicity caused by VCD.This article provides an overview of the questions asked and the approaches taken in studying VCH and VCD to support these conclusions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21211517>Accelerated ovarian failure: a novel, chemically induced animal model of menopause.</a></h2><p>Current rodent models of menopause fail to adequately recapitulate the menopause transition. The intact aging model fails to achieve very low estrogen levels, and the ovariectomy model lacks a perimenopause phase. A new rodent model of accelerated ovarian failure (AOF) successfully replicates human perimenopause and postmenopause, including estrous acyclicity and fluctuating, followed by undetectable, estrogen levels, and allows for the dissociation of the effects of hormone levels from the effects of aging. In this model, an ovotoxic chemical,  diepoxide (VCD), selective for primary and primordial follicles, is injected intraperitonelly in animals for 15 days. As the mature follicle population is depleted through natural cycling, ovarian failure follows increasing periods of acyclity. Administered at low doses, VCD specifically causes apoptotic cell death of primordial follicles but does not affect other peripheral tissues, including the liver and spleen, nor does it affect brain  markers. In addition to reducing confounds associated with genetic and surgical manipulations, the AOF model maintains the presence of ovarian tissue which importantly parallels to the menopause transition in humans. The VCD injection procedure can be applied to studies using transgenic or knockout mice strains, or in other disease-state models (e.g., ischemia, atherosclerosis, or diabetes). This AOF model of menopause will generate new insights into women's health particularly in determining the critical periods (i.e., a window of opportunity) during perimenopause for restoring ovarian hormones for the most efficacious effect on memory and mood disorders as well as other menopausal symptoms.Copyright © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

In women, studies suggest that ovarian hormone loss associated with menopause has deleterious cognitive effects. Results from clinical studies evaluating whether estrogen-containing HT mitigates these effects, and benefits cognition, are discrepant. Type of menopause, surgical vs. transitional, impacts cognitive outcome in women. However, whether type of menopause impacts cognitive effects of HT has not been methodically tested in women or an animal model. We used the  diepoxide rodent model of ovarian follicle depletion, which mimics transitional menopause, and the traditional rat model of menopause, ovariectomy, to cognitively test the most commonly prescribed estrogen therapy in the United States, conjugated equine estrogens (Premarin). Here we show conjugated equine estrogens benefited cognition in surgically menopausal rats, but, in contrast, impaired cognition in transitionally menopausal rats. Androstenedione, released from the residual transitional menopausal ovary, was positively associated with impaired performance, replicating our previous findings in  diepoxide animals. The current findings are especially salient given that no clinical study testing cognition has methodically separated these two populations of menopausal women for analysis. That we now show surgical vs. transitional modes of menopause result in disparate cognitive effects of HT has implications for future research and treatments optimizing HT for menopausal women.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21677306>Inhibition of ovarian KIT phosphorylation by the ovotoxicant  diepoxide in rats.</a></h2><p>In vitro exposure of Postnatal Day 4 (PND4) rat ovaries to the occupational chemical  diepoxide (VCD) destroys specifically primordial and primary follicles via acceleration of atresia. Because oocyte-expressed c-kit (KIT) plays a critical role in follicle survival and activation, a direct interaction of VCD with KIT as its mechanism of ovotoxicity was investigated. PND4 rat ovaries were cultured with and without VCD (30 μM) for 2 days. When assessed by Western analysis or mobility shift detection, phosphorylated KIT (pKIT) was decreased (P < 0.05) by VCD exposure, while total KIT protein was unaffected. Anti-mouse KIT2 (ACK2) antibody binds KIT and blocks its signaling , whereas anti-mouse KIT 4 (ACK4) antibody binds KIT but does not block its activity. PND4 rat ovaries were incubated for 2 days with and without VCD with and without ACK2 (80 μg/ml) or ACK4 (80 μg/ml). ACK2 decreased pKIT; however, ACK4 had no effect. Conversely, ACK2 did not affect a VCD-induced decrease in pKIT, whereas ACK4 further reduced it. Because ACK2 and ACK4 (known to directly bind KIT) affect VCD responses, these results support the fact that VCD interacts directly with KIT. The effect of these antibodies on VCD-induced follicle loss was measured after 8 days of incubation. ACK2 further reduced (P < 0.05) VCD-induced follicle loss, whereas ACK4 did not affect it. These findings demonstrate that VCD induces ovotoxicity by direct inhibition of KIT autophosphorylation of the oocyte. The data also further support the vital function of KIT and its signaling pathway in primordial follicle survival and activation, as well as its role in VCD-induced ovotoxicity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22932883>An update on primary ovarian insufficiency.</a></h2><p>Primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) occurs in about 1% of female population under the age of 40, leading to reproductive problems, an earlier encounter with menopausal symptoms, and complicated diseases. There are three presumable mechanisms involved in the development of POI, namely apoptosis acceleration, follicular maturation blocking and premature follicle activation, through the following studied causes: (i) chromosomal abnormalities or gene mutations: mostly involve X chromosome, such as FMR1 premutation; more and more potentially causal genes have been screened recently; (ii)  disorders such as classic galactosaemia and 17-OH deficiency; (iii) autoimmune mediated ovarian damage: observed alone or with some certain autoimmune disorders and syndromes; but the specificity and sensitivity of antibodies towards ovary are still questionable; (iv) iatrogenic: radiotherapy or chemotherapy used in cancer treatment, as well as pelvic surgery with potential threat to ovaries' blood supply can directly damage ovarian function; (v) virus infection such as HIV and mumps; (vi) toxins and other environmental/lifestyle factors: cigarette smoking, toxins (e.g.,  diepoxide), and other environmental factors are associated with the development of POI. The etiology of a majority of POI cases is not identified, and is believed to be multifactorial. Strategies to POI include hormone replacement and infertility treatment. Assisted conception with donated oocytes has been proven to achieve pregnancy in POI women. Embryo cryopreservation, ovarian tissue cryopreservation and oocyte cryopreservation have been used to preserve ovarian reserve in women undergoing cancer treatments.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26491098>ANG II-induced hypertension in the VCD mouse model of menopause is prevented by estrogen replacement during perimenopause.</a></h2><p>Premenopausal females are resistant to the development of hypertension, and this protection is lost after the onset of menopause, resulting in a sharp increase in disease onset and severity. However, it is unknown how a fluctuating ovarian hormone environment during the transition from perimenopause to menopause impacts the onset of hypertension, and whether interventions during perimenopause prevent disease onset after menopause. A gradual transition to menopause was induced by repeated daily injections of  diepoxide (VCD). ANG II (800 ng·kg(-1)·min(-1)) was infused into perimenopausal and menopausal female mice for 14 days. A separate cohort of mice received 17β-estradiol replacement during perimenopause. ANG II infusion produced significantly higher mean arterial pressure (MAP) in menopausal vs. cycling females, and 17β-estradiol replacement prevented this increase. In contrast, MAP was not significantly different when ANG II was infused into perimenopausal and cycling females, suggesting that female resistance to ANG II-induced hypertension is intact during perimenopause. ANG II infusion caused a significant glomerular hypertrophy, and hypertrophy was not impacted by hormonal status. Expression levels of aquaporin-2 (AQP2), a collecting duct protein, have been suggested to reflect blood pressure. AQP2 protein expression was significantly downregulated in the renal cortex of the ANG II-infused menopause group, where blood pressure was increased. AQP2 expression levels were restored to control levels with 17β-estradiol replacement. This study indicates that the changing hormonal environment in the VCD model of menopause impacts the severity of ANG II-induced hypertension. These data highlight the utility of the ovary-intact VCD model of menopause as a clinically relevant model to investigate the physiological mechanisms of hypertension that occur in women during the transition into menopause.Copyright © 2015 the American Physiological Society.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11368546>Stereochemical aspects in the  biotransformation with rat liver microsomes and purified p450s. monoepoxides and diols.</a></h2><p>The stereochemical course of the biotransformation of  (VCH, 1) by liver microsomes from male and female control and induced rats and purified rat P450 2B1 and 2E1 has been determined. The epoxidation of 1, catalyzed by male microsomes, occurs on both the endo- and exocyclic double bond to give four isomeric epoxides, cis- 1,2-epoxide (2), trans- 1,2-epoxide (3), (4R*,7S*)- 7,8-epoxide (4), and (4R*,7R*)- 7,8-epoxide (5). On the other hand, microsomes from female rats catalyzed primarily the endocyclic epoxidation. The stereoselectivity of this process was strongly dependent on gender and P450 induction. Only the phenobarbital and pyrazole, at lower levels, were able to enhance the epoxidation of 1 and mostly on the endocyclic double bond. Also, P450 2E1 and 2B1 in a reconstituted system were able to perform the epoxidation of 1 primarily on its endocyclic double bond. The metabolites, cis- and trans- 1,2-epoxide (2 and 3, respectively) and the isomeric  7,8-epoxides (4 and 5), were rapidly biotransformed into the corresponding vicinal diols by mEH-catalyzed hydrolysis. The reaction of the endocyclic epoxides occurred with good substrate diastereo- and enantioselectivity favoring the hydrolysis of epoxides (1S,2R,4S)-3 and (1R,2S,4S)-2 to give, before 50% conversion, selectively (1R,2R,4S)-diol (6). At variance, the hydrolysis of the exocyclic epoxides was characterized by a high level of substrate enantioselection associated with a very low, if any, level of substrate diastereoselection, the two epoxides, (4R,7S)-4 and (4R,7R)-5, being hydrolyzed practically with the same rate. On the basis of the major resistance to mEH hydrolysis, the endocyclic epoxides, (1R,2S,4R)-3 and (1S,2R,4R)-2, are expected to be further oxidized, in a stereochemical manner, to the specific mutagenic diepoxides which are thought to play a crucial role in VCH ovotoxicity. Thus, VCH ovotoxicity may be markedly affected by the reactivity of the diepoxidic stereoisomers formed and detoxicated.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22239082> diepoxide: a model chemical for ovotoxicity.</a></h2><p>The occupational chemical  diepoxide (VCD) has been shown to cause selective destruction of ovarian small pre-antral (primordial and primary) follicles in rats and mice by accelerating the natural, apoptotic process of atresia. Chemicals that destroy primordial follicles are of concern to women because exposure can result in premature ovarian failure (early menopause). Initial studies using in vivo exposure of rats determined that VCD specifically targets primordial and primary (small pre-antral) follicles and that repeated dosing is required. Through a method of isolation of ovarian small follicles, biochemical and molecular studies determined that intracellular pro-apoptotic  are activated following VCD dosing in rats. Subsequently an in vitro system using cultured whole neonatal rat ovaries was developed to provide more mechanistic information. That approach was used to demonstrate that the cell survival c-kit/kit ligand signaling pathway is the direct target for VCD-induced ovotoxicity. Specifically, VCD directly interacts with the oocyte-associated c-kit receptor to inhibit its autophosphorylation, and thereby impair oocyte viability. The cellular and molecular approach developed to determine these findings is described in this article.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21076081>Inhibition of PIK3 signaling pathway members by the ovotoxicant  diepoxide in rats.</a></h2><p> diepoxide (VCD), an occupational chemical that specifically destroys primordial and small primary follicles in the ovaries of rats and mice, is thought to target an oocyte-expressed tyrosine kinase receptor, Kit. This study compared the temporal effect of VCD on protein distribution of KIT and its downstream PIK3-activated proteins, AKT and FOXO3. Postnatal Day 4 Fischer 344 rat ovaries were cultured in control media ± VCD (30 μM) for 2-8 days (d2-d8). KIT, AKT, phosphorylated AKT, FOXO3, and pFOXO3 protein levels were assessed by Western blotting and/or immunofluorescence staining with confocal microscopy. Phosphorylated AKT was decreased (P < 0.05) in oocyte nuclei in primordial (39% decrease) and small primary (37% decrease) follicles within 2 days of VCD exposure. After d4, VCD reduced (P < 0.05) oocyte staining for KIT (primordial, 44% decrease; small primary, 39% decrease) and FOXO3 (primordial, 40% decrease; small primary, 36% decrease) protein. Total AKT and pFOXO3 were not affected by VCD at any time. Akt1 mRNA, as measured by quantitative RT-PCR, was reduced (P < 0.05) by 23% on d4 of VCD exposure, but returned to control levels on d6 and d8. VCD exposure reduced Foxo3a mRNA by 26% on d6 (P < 0.05) and by 23% on d8 (P < 0.1). These results demonstrate that the earliest observed effect of VCD is an inhibition of phosphorylation and nuclear localization of AKT in the oocyte of primordial and small primary follicles. This event is followed by reductions in KIT and FOXO3 protein subcellular distribution prior to changes in mRNA. Thus, these findings further support that VCD induces ovotoxicity by directly targeting the oocyte through posttranslational inhibition of KIT-mediated signaling components.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24926825>Characterization of neural estrogen signaling and neurotrophic changes in the accelerated ovarian failure mouse model of menopause.</a></h2><p>Accelerated ovarian failure (AOF) can be induced in young mice with low doses of  diepoxide (VCD), modeling the hormone changes observed across menopause. We assessed markers of synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus, anxiety-like behavior, and spatial learning longitudinally at 4 time points across the AOF model: premenopause, early perimenopause, late perimenopause, and postmenopause (POST). As others have shown, VCD administration decreased ovarian follicle counts and increased acyclicity as the model progressed to POST but with no impact on organ or body weights. The morphology of Iba1 immunoreactive microglia did not differ between vehicle- and VCD-administered mice. Hippocampal postsynaptic density 95 levels were minimally altered across the AOF model but decreased at POST in CA3b 24 hours after exogenous estradiol benzoate (EB). In contrast, hippocampal phosphorylated AKT levels transiently decreased in premenopause but increased at POST after 24 hours of EB in select subregions. Electron microscopy revealed fewer estrogen receptor α containing dendritic spines and terminals in CA1 stratum radiatum at POST. mRNA levels of most brain-derived neurotrophic factor exons (except V and VI) were lower in POST compared with ovariectomized mice. Exon V was sensitive to 24 hours of EB administration in POST-VCD. Anxiety-like behavior was unaffected at any menopause phase. Spatial learning was unaffected in all groups, but POST-VCD mice performed below chance. Our results suggest that the AOF model is suitable for longitudinal studies of neurobiological changes across the menopause transition in mice. Our findings also point to complex interactions between estrogen receptors and  involved in synaptic plasticity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8209381>Reduced ability of rat preantral ovarian follicles to metabolize 4-vinyl-1-cyclohexene diepoxide in vitro.</a></h2><p> diepoxide (1-epoxyethyl-3,4-epoxycyclohexane, VCD), an industrial chemical, is a potential health hazard because it destroys oocytes in small preantral follicles in rats. We proposed that VCD destroys oocytes in these follicles because of their reduced capacity to detoxify VCD (convert VCD to tetrol, 4-(1,2-dihydroxy)ethyl-1,2-dihydroxycyclohexane). Ovaries, livers, and adrenal glands were collected from immature and mature Fischer 344 rats. Tissues were dissociated and ovarian tissue was separated into distinct follicular fractions. Tissues were incubated with [14C]VCD and media were assayed for [14C]tetrol by HPLC. In immature rats, conversion of VCD to tetrol in large preantral follicles and hepatocytes was 1.5-fold greater than in small preantral follicles and 4-fold greater than in ovarian interstitial cells (p < 0.05). In adults, conversion of VCD to tetrol in large preantral follicles and hepatocytes was, respectively, 3- and 10-fold greater than in small preantral follicles and interstitial cells (p < 0.05). Compared with immature rats, all tissues from adult rats converted more VCD to tetrol (p < 0.05). These data demonstrate that interstitial cells and small preantral follicles from adult and immature rats have a reduced capacity to convert VCD to tetrol compared to large preantral follicles and liver cells. This may explain their increased susceptibility to VCD-induced ovotoxicity. Furthermore, adult rats may be less susceptible to VCD-induced ovotoxicity than immature rats.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2933247>The Reproductive Effects Assessment Group's report on the mutagenicity of 1,3-butadiene and its reactive metabolites.</a></h2><p>A major data gap for assessing heritable risk from exposure to 1,3-butadiene is the lack of mammalian mutagenicity data. The data base on the mutagenic potential of 1,3-butadiene is limited to three bacterial studies from the same laboratory. Two of these studies were positive only in the presence of liver S9 mix from chemically pretreated animals. In vitro data suggest that 1,3-butadiene is metabolized to two epoxide intermediates. 3,4-Epoxybutene, one potential reactive metabolite of 1,3-butadiene, is a monofunctional alkylating agent and is a direct-acting mutagen in bacteria. In addition, unpublished data suggest that 3,4-epoxy-butene induces DNA damage and chromosomal aberrations in mice. Another potential reactive metabolite, 1,2:3,4-diepoxybutane, is a bifunctional alkylating agent and is mutagenic in a wide variety of organisms (bacteria, fungi, and the germ cells of Drosophila). This metabolite also induces DNA damage in mice and in cultured hamster cells, is clastogenic in fungi and cultured rat cells, and produces chromosome damage/breakage in Drosophila germ cells. These data, when combined with evidence that 1,3-butadiene is carcinogenic in rodent gonadal tissues and is associated with gonadal atrophy in mice, constitute suggestive evidence that 1,3-butadiene may be a human germ cell mutagen. However, because the mutagenicity of 1,3-butadiene has been studied only in bacteria, studies in mammalian test systems are needed to further characterize the mutagenic potential of 1,3-butadiene.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18829706>Steroidogenic capacity of residual ovarian tissue in  diepoxide-treated mice.</a></h2><p>Menopause is an important public health issue because of its association with a number of disorders. Androgens produced by residual ovarian tissue after menopause could impact the development of these disorders. It has been unclear, however, whether the postmenopausal ovary retains steroidogenic capacity. Thus, an ovary-intact mouse model for menopause that uses the occupational chemical  diepoxide (VCD) was used to characterize the expression of steroidogenic genes in residual ovarian tissue of follicle-depleted mice. Female B6C3F1 mice (age, 28 days) were dosed daily for 20 days with either vehicle or VCD (160 mg kg(-1) day(-1)) to induce ovarian failure. Ovaries were collected on Day 181 and analyzed for mRNA and protein. Acyclic aged mice were used as controls for natural ovarian senescence. Relative to cycling controls, expression of mRNA encoding steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (Star); cholesterol side-chain cleavage (Cyp11a1); 3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (Hsd3b); 17alpha-hydroxylase (Cyp17a1); scavenger receptor class B, type 1 (Scarb1); low-density lipoprotein receptor (Ldlr); and luteinizing hormone receptor (Lhcgr) was enriched in VCD-treated ovaries. In acyclic aged ovaries, mRNA expression for only Cyp17a1 and Lhcgr was greater than that in controls. Compared to cycling controls, ovaries from VCD-treated and aged mice had similar levels of HSD3B, CYP17A1, and LHCGR protein. The pattern of protein immunofluorescence staining for HSD3B in follicle-depleted (VCD-treated) ovaries was homogeneous, whereas that for CYP17A1 was only seen in residual interstitial cells. Circulating levels of FSH and LH were increased, and androstenedione levels were detectable following follicle depletion in VCD-treated mice.

Therefore, this study was designed to investigate a potential role of the AhR in VCD-induced ovotoxicity. Female F344 rats, C57BL/6 mice, or AhR-deficient (-/-, AhRKO) mice were dosed daily (15 days) with vehicle, VCD (80 mg/kg, i.p.) and/or the AhR antagonist, alpha-naphthoflavone (ANF; 80 mg/kg, i.p.). Compared with controls, VCD caused a 60% reduction (P < 0.05) in primordial and primary follicles in mice and rats. Concurrent dosing with ANF protected against the VCD-induced follicle loss in rats, but not in mice. As with AhR-intact mice and rats, VCD induced a 70% loss (P < 0.05) of small pre-antral follicles in AhRKO mice. AhR mRNA expression was increased (P < 0.05) by VCD dosing in small pre-antral follicles isolated from ovaries of rats but not mice. AhR protein in rats was increased by VCD dosing in oocyte nuclei in primordial and primary follicles when measured by immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy. In rat small pre-antral follicles, apoptosis-associated caspase-3-like activity was increased (P < 0.05) by VCD treatment, decreased (P < 0.05) by ANF treatment, and unaffected by VCD plus ANF treatment. VCD had no effect on expression of GST Ya1 or GST Ya2 mRNA or CYP 1A1 protein in rats. Taken together, these findings demonstrate a difference between rats and mice in the potential involvement of AhR as related to VCD-induced ovotoxicity. Whereas, AhR appears to be involved in rats, no evidence for a similar role in mice was obtained. Overall, these findings point out that there can be mechanistic species differences in ovarian responses to xenobiotic chemicals.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2225327>The biochemical basis for the species difference in hepatic microsomal  epoxidation between female mice and rats.</a></h2><p>Mice but not rats are susceptible to  (VCH)-induced ovarian toxicity and carcinogenicity. This is due in part to a 4- to 6-fold greater rate of hepatic microsomal bioactivation of VCH to the ovotoxicant VCH-1,2-epoxide. The biochemical basis for this difference was investigated in microsomes using enzyme induction, enzyme inhibition with chloramphenicol or specific inhibitory antibodies, and correlation with marker steroid hydroxylase activities to associate VCH epoxidation with particular cytochrome P450 forms. Testosterone 6 beta- and 15 alpha-hydroxylase activities and VCH epoxidation were decreased in microsomes from chloramphenicol-treated mice, initially suggesting the possible involvement of P450IIIA and P450IIA forms in VCH . Although both testosterone 6 beta-hydroxylase and VCH epoxidase activities were increased by dexamethasone treatment (P450IIIA inducer), anti-rat P450IIIA IgG inhibited testosterone 6 beta-hydroxylase (68%) but not VCH epoxidase activity. These latter results do not support the involvement of mouse P450IIIA forms in VCH epoxidation. However, results were obtained which indicated that mouse P450IIA forms are involved in VCH epoxidation. In microsomes from untreated female mice VCH epoxidase activity was inhibited 48% by antibodies to mouse P45015 alpha (P450IIA3) at a concentration that inhibited testosterone 15 alpha-hydroxylase activity by 86%. No protein immunochemically related to mouse P45015 alpha was detected in female rat hepatic microsomes. VCH epoxidation by hepatic microsomes was increased in female mice and rats by phenobarbital treatment and was inhibited by approximately one-third by anti-rat-P450IIB1 IgG in microsomes from untreated animals of both species. Furthermore, microsomal VCH epoxidase and testosterone 16 alpha-hydroxylase activities were lower (34%) in female 129/J mice (deficient in constitutive expression of P450IIB forms) than in B6C3F1 mice. These results suggested partial involvement of P450IIB forms in the microsomal epoxidation of VCH. Therefore, P450 forms IIA and IIB account for the majority of VCH bioactivation in female mouse liver, which explains in part the susceptibility of mice to VCH-induced ovarian toxicity and carcinogenicity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22531813>Impact of environmental exposures on ovarian function and role of xenobiotic  during ovotoxicity.</a></h2><p>The mammalian ovary is a heterogeneous organ and contains oocyte-containing follicles at varying stages of development. The most immature follicular stage, the primordial follicle, comprises the ovarian reserve and is a finite number, defined at the time of birth. Depletion of all follicles within the ovary leads to reproductive senescence, known as menopause. A number of chemical classes can destroy follicles, thus hastening entry into the menopausal state. The ovarian response to chemical exposure can determine the extent of ovotoxicity that occurs. Enzymes capable of bioactivating as well as detoxifying xenobiotics are expressed in the ovary and their impact on ovotoxicity has been partially characterized for trichloroethylene, 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene, and . This review will discuss those studies, as well as illustrate where knowledge gaps remain for chemicals that have also been established as ovotoxicants.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Female 28-day Fisher 344 (F344) rats were dosed (30 days) with VCD (80 mg/kg per day, i.p.) or vehicle, and animals were evaluated for reproductive function at subsequent time points for up to 360 days. At each time point animals were killed, and ovaries and plasma collected. VCD reduced (P<0.05) the number of preantral follicles by day 30 relative to control. There were no ultrastructural differences in morphology between VCD-treated and control ovaries. Circulating FSH levels in VCD-treated animals were greater (days 120, 240, and 360, P<0.05) than in controls. Cyclicity was disrupted in the VCD-treated group by day 360. These results show that VCD-induced follicular destruction in rats is associated with a sequence of events (loss of preantral follicles, increased plasma FSH, and cyclic disruption) preceding premature ovarian senescence that is similar to events that occur during the onset of menopause in women.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15994440>Atherosclerotic lesion development in a novel ovary-intact mouse model of perimenopause.</a></h2><p>Since the unexpected results from the Women's Health Initiative, the possible protective role of estrogen in preventing heart disease in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women is uncertain.

At 120 days after start of cholesterol feeding, the extent of lesion in aorta and innominate artery was determined. Lesion area in both locations was similar in vehicle control, VCD-treated, and ovariectomized mice. Replacement with 17beta-estradiol caused lesion reduction (P<0.05) in both arterial locations, but it was most efficacious in suppressing innominate lesion area in VCD-treated mice (12.9+/-5.2%) compared with ovariectomized mice (40.0+/-6.04%).Endocrine status associated with the follicle-depleted ovary influences exogenous estradiol effects during the development of atherosclerotic lesions and, in particular, inhibits lesion progression in the innominate artery.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2237911>Comparison of the disposition and in vitro  of  in the female mouse and rat.</a></h2><p> (VCH) is a chemical to which humans are exposed in the rubber industry. A chronic carcinogenicity bioassay conducted by the National Toxicology Program showed that oral administration of VCH induced tumors in the ovaries of mice but not in those of rats. The hypothesis tested was that the species and organ specificity of VCH toxicity was due to differences in the disposition of VCH between the female rat and mouse. Therefore, the disposition of a single oral dose of 400 mg/kg [14C]VCH was studied in female B6C3F1 mice and Fischer 344 rats. Mice eliminated greater than 95% of the dose in 24 hr, whereas rats required 48 hr to eliminate greater than 95% of the dose. The major routes of excretion of [14C]VCH-derived radioactivity were in the urine (50-60%) and expired air (30-40%). No evidence was obtained to indicate that the ovaries of either species retained VCH as a parent compound or as radioactive equivalents. A dramatic difference was observed between the rat and mouse in the appearance of a monoepoxide of VCH in blood from 0.5 to 6 hr after VCH administration (800 mg/kg, ip). VCH-1,2-epoxide was present in the blood of mice with the highest concentration at 2 hr (41 nmol/ml). The blood concentration of VCH-1,2-epoxide in rats was less than 2.5 nmol/ml at all times examined. VCH-7,8-epoxide was not present in the blood of either species at the level of detection. These findings were supported by in vitro studies of VCH epoxidation by liver microsomes. The rate of epoxidation of VCH (1 mM) to VCH-1,2-epoxide was 6.5-fold greater in mouse liver microsomes than that in rat liver microsomes. The species difference in the rate of epoxide formation by the liver may be an important factor in the species difference in susceptibility to VCH-induced ovarian tumors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26659944>Alterations in the subcellular distribution of NADPH oxidase p47(phox) in hypothalamic paraventricular neurons following slow-pressor angiotensin II hypertension in female mice with accelerated ovarian failure.</a></h2><p>At younger ages, women have a lower risk for hypertension than men, but this sexual dimorphism declines with the onset of menopause. These differences are paralleled in rodents following "slow-pressor" angiotensin II (AngII) administration: young male and aged female mice, but not young females, develop hypertension. There is also an established sexual dimorphism both in the cardiovascular response to the neurohypophyseal hormone arginine vasopressin (AVP) and in the expression of oxidative stress. We examined the relationship between AngII-mediated hypertension and the cellular distribution of the superoxide generating NADPH oxidase (NOX) in AVP-expressing hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) neurons in "menopausal" female mice. Dual-labeling immunoelectron microscopy was used to determine whether the subcellular distribution of the organizer/adapter NOX p47(phox) subunit is altered in PVN dendrites following AngII administered (14 days) during the "postmenopausal" stage of accelerated ovarian failure (AOF) in young female mice treated with  diepoxide. Slow-pressor AngII elevated blood pressure in AOF females and induced a significant increase in near plasmalemmal p47(phox) and a decrease in cytoplasmic p47(phox) in PVN AVP dendrites. These changes are the opposite of those observed in AngII-induced hypertensive male mice (Coleman et al. [2013] J. Neurosci. 33:4308-4316) and may be ascribed in part to baseline differences between young females and males in the near plasmalemmal p47(phox) on AVP dendrites seen in the present study. These findings highlight fundamental differences in the neural substrates of oxidative stress in the PVN associated with AngII hypertension in postmenopausal females compared with males. J. Comp.

Here we show that Nrf2 protects against the ovarian toxicity of  diepoxide (VCD) in mice. Nrf2-/- female mice exposed to VCD exhibit an age-dependent decline in reproduction leading to secondary infertility accompanied by hypergonadotropic hypogonadism after 30 weeks of age. VCD is shown to selectively destroy small ovarian follicles, resulting in early depletion of functional follicles. Treatment with VCD induces apoptotic death in cultured cells and in ovarian follicles, suggesting apoptosis as a mechanism of follicle loss. Loss of Nrf2 function blocks the basal and inducible expression of microsomal epoxide hydrolase, a key enzyme in the detoxification of VCD, and increases the oxidative stress in cells that is further exacerbated by VCD. Foxo3a, a repressor in the early stages of follicle activation, displays reduced expression in Nrf2-/- ovaries, causing accelerated growth of follicles in the absence of exposure to exogenous chemicals. Furthermore, Foxo3a is degraded through the 26S proteasome pathway in untreated cells and is induced by VCD via both Nrf2-dependent transcription and protein stabilization. This study demonstrates that Nrf2 serves as an essential sensor and regulator of chemical homeostasis in ovarian cells, protecting the cells from toxic chemicals by controlling  detoxification, reactive oxygen species defense, and Foxo3a expression. In addition, these findings raise the possibility that exposure to environmental or occupational ovotoxicants plays a role in the premature ovarian failure commonly associated with infertility and premature aging in women.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7949757>Long-term ovarian and gonadotropin changes in mice exposed to .</a></h2><p>This study investigated the relationships between -induced follicular destruction, plasma FSH levels, and the development of ovarian preneoplastic changes. Female, 28-day-old, B6C3F1 mice were administered VCH (800 mg/kg/day, ip) or sesame seed oil, ip daily for 30 days. At 30, 60, 120, 240, and 360 days following the beginning of treatment, groups were killed, their ovaries were harvested, and plasma was collected for measurement of FSH. Ovarian weight was less and oocytes contained in preantral follicles were significantly fewer than controls at all time points. Plasma FSH concentrations in VCH-treated animals were increased significantly above controls at 240 d and 360 d. Histologically, there was oocyte loss at all times, whereas at 240 and 360 days, small to medium, irregularly shaped foci of hypertrophic cells were present. In addition, at 360 days 80% of the VCH-treated mice had a 1- to 2-mm, blood-filled cystic structure present in one or both ovaries. These studies indicate that VCH-induced oocyte destruction and follicle loss are associated with increases in plasma FSH, are associated with ovarian failure at 360 days, and are temporally related to ovarian cellular hypertrophy and the formation of blood-filled cystic ovarian structures. These events are possibly related to ovarian neoplasms produced by long-term exposure to VCH.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29778464>Peroxiredoxin 2 deficiency accelerates age-related ovarian failure through the reactive oxygen species-mediated JNK pathway in mice.</a></h2><p>Reactive oxygen species (ROS) produced in biological reactions have been shown to contribute to ovarian aging. Peroxiredoxin 2 (Prx2) is an antioxidant enzyme that protects cells by scavenging ROS; however, its effect on age-related, oxidative stress-associated ovarian failure has not been reported. Here, we investigated its role in age-related ovarian dysfunction and  diepoxide (VCD)-induced premature ovarian failure using Prx2-deficient mice. Compared to those in wildtype (WT) mice, serum levels of anti-Müllerian hormone, 17β-estradiol, and progesterone and numbers of follicles and corpora lutea were significantly lower in 18-month-old Prx2 mice. Moreover, levels of Bax, cytochrome c, cleaved caspase-3, and phosphorylated JNK proteins were higher and numbers of apoptotic (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling-positive) cells were considerably greater in 18-month-old Prx2 ovaries than WT ovaries. Furthermore, the effects of the ovarian toxicant VCD in significantly enhancing ROS levels and apoptosis through activation of JNK-mediated apoptotic signaling were more pronounced in Prx2 than WT mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Expression of the steroidogenic proteins StAR, CYP11A1, and 3β-HSD and serum levels of 17β-estradiol and progesterone were also reduced to a greater extent in Prx2 mice than WT mice after VCD injection. This reduced steroidogenesis was rescued by addition of the Prx mimic ebselen or JNK inhibitor SP600125. This constitutes the first report that Prx2 deficiency leads to acceleration of age-related or VCD-induced ovarian failure by activation of the ROS-induced JNK pathway. These findings suggest that Prx2 plays an important role in preventing accelerated ovarian failure by inhibiting ROS-induced JNK activation.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

This industrial chemical is bioactivated by hepatic CYP450 to the diepoxide metabolite, VCD, which destroys mouse small preantral follicles (F1). Since ovarian mEH may play a role in VCD detoxification, these studies investigated the expression and activity of mEH in isolated ovarian fractions. Mice were given 1 or 15 daily doses (ip) of VCH (7.4 mmol/kg/day) or VCD (0.57 mmol/kg/day); 4 h following the final dose, ovaries were removed, distinct populations of intact follicles (F1, 25-100 microm; F2, 100-250 microm; F3, > 250 microm) and interstitial cells (Int) were isolated, and total RNA and protein were extracted. Real-time polymerase chain reaction and the substrate cis-stilbene oxide (CSO; 12.5 microM) were used to evaluate expression and specific activity of mEH, respectively. Confocal microscopy evaluated ovarian distribution of mEH protein. Expression of mRNA encoding mEH was increased in F1 (410 +/- 5% VCH; 292 +/- 5% VCD) and F2 (1379 +/- 4% VCH; 381 +/- 11% VCD) follicles following repeated dosing with VCH or VCD. Catalytic activity of mEH increased in F1 follicles following repeated dosing with VCH/VCD (381 +/- 11% VCH; 384 +/- 27% VCD). Visualized by confocal microscopy, mEH protein was distributed throughout the ovary with the greatest staining intensity in the interstitial cells and staining in the theca cells that was increased by dosing (56 +/- 0.8% VCH; 29 +/- 0.9% VCD). We conclude that mEH is expressed and is functional in mouse ovarian follicles. Additionally,in vivo dosing with VCH and VCD affects these parameters.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27769945>Akt activation by Evodiae Fructus extract protects ovary against  diepoxide-induced ovotoxicity.</a></h2><p>Evodiae Fructus (EF) is the dried, unripe fruit of Evodia rutaecarpa Benth., and one of the main components of traditional herbal prescriptions issued for the treatment of sterility caused by irregular menstruation in Korea. However, scientific evidence regarding the efficacy and action mechanism of EF is lacking.In this study, the authors established an in vitro screening tool to identify promising new drug candidates in herbal medicines for the prevention and treatment of premature ovarian failure. The protective effects of EF extracts against  diepoxide (VCD)-induced ovotoxicity were investigated and the molecular mechanism responsible was sought.EF extract was prepared by boiling EF in water and its quality was confirmed by high performance liquid chromatography. CHO-K1 (Chinese hamster ovary cells) and COV434 (human ovarian granulosa cells) cells were plated, pretreated with EF extract for 2h and then treated with 1.5mM or 0.5mM VCD for 24h, respectively. Cell viabilities were measured using an MTT assay, and protein levels were determined by western blotting.VCD significantly suppressed the viability of both CHO-K1 and COV434 cells in a dose-dependent manner and induced the apoptosis of CHO-K1 cells at 1.5mM. EF extract dose-dependently blocked the ovotoxicity induced by treatment with VCD. Furthermore, EF extract significantly activated Akt and downstream effectors such as mTOR and GSK-3β in CHO-K1 cells. The ability of EF extract to prevent cytotoxicity by VCD was antagonized by pretreatment of LY294002, a PI3K/Akt inhibitor.EF has the ability to protect ovary cells against VCD-induced ovotoxicity, probably via Akt activation. These results suggest that the beneficial effects of EF might be useful for preventing premature ovarian failure or unexplained infertility caused by environmental factors.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Chronic treatment of B6C3F1 mice and F-344 rats with VCH by gavage has been shown to induce ovarian tumors in mice but not in rats. Our objective was to understand the mechanism of the species difference in VCH-induced ovarian tumors. Since a critical step in the induction of ovarian tumors is destruction of the small oocyte, small oocyte counts obtained from serially sectioned ovaries were used as an index of toxicity. VCH or its epoxide metabolites [VCH-diepoxide, VCH-1,2-epoxide, and VCH-7,8-epoxide (in mice only)] were given to 28-day-old female mice and rats in corn oil, ip, at doses ranging from 0.07 to 7.4 mmol/kg body wt/day for 30 days. The dose which reduced the small oocyte count to 50% that of control was defined as the ED50. In mice, the ED50 for the reduction in small oocytes by VCH was 2.7 mmol/kg, whereas, no detectable oocyte loss occurred in rats at the highest dose of VCH (7.4 mmol/kg). The potency of the epoxides of VCH was greater than that of VCH in both species. The ED50 for oocyte loss by VCH-1,2-epoxide in mice and rats was 0.5 and 1.4 mmol/kg, respectively. In mice, VCH-7,8-epoxide had comparable potency to VCH-1,2-epoxide (ED50 = 0.7). VCH diepoxide was even more potent with ED50 values of 0.2 and 0.4 mmol/kg, in mice and rats, respectively. The dose response of the blood concentration of VCH-1,2-epoxide in mice after VCH showed that doses of VCH which caused minimal toxicity had the lowest blood level of this ovotoxic epoxide. Pretreatment of mice with the cytochrome P450 inhibitor chloramphenicol (200 mg/kg, ip) inhibited VCH epoxidation in vivo and in vitro and partially protected mice from VCH toxicity. Thus it appears that  of VCH to epoxides and their subsequent destruction of oocytes are critical steps in VCH-induced ovarian tumors. Rats may be resistant to ovarian tumor induction by VCH because the amount of VCH converted to epoxides is insufficient to produce oocyte destruction.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8794232>Ovarian toxicity and  of  and analogues in B6C3F1 mice: structure-activity study of  and analogues.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27264932>Glucose homeostasis in rats treated with  diepoxide is not worsened by dexamethasone treatment.</a></h2><p>4-vinilcyclohexene diepoxide (4-VCD) causes premature ovarian failure and may result in estrogen deficiency, characterizing the transition to estropause in rodents (equivalent to menopause in women). Estropause/menopause is associated with metabolic derangements such as glucose intolerance and insulin resistance. Glucocorticoids (GCs) are known to exert diabetogenic effects. Thus, we aimed to investigate whether rats with premature ovarian failure are more prone to the diabetogenic effects of GC. For this, immature female rats received daily injections of 4-VCD [160mg/kg body weight (b.w.), intraperitoneally (i.p.)] for 15 consecutive days, whereas control rats received vehicle. After 168days of the completion of 4-VCD administration, rats were divided into 4 groups: CTL-received daily injections of saline (1mL/kg, b.w., i.p.) for 5days; DEX-received daily injections of dexamethasone (1mg/kg, b.w., i.p.) for 5days; VCD-treated as CTL group; VCD+DEX-treated as DEX group. Experiments and euthanasia occurred one day after the last dexamethasone injection. 4-VCD-treated rats exhibited ovary hypotrophy and reduced number of preantral follicles (p<0.05). Premature ovarian failure had no impact on the body weight gain or food intake, but both were reduced by the effects of dexamethasone. The increase in blood glucose, plasma insulin and triacylglycerol levels as well as the reduction in insulin sensitivity caused by dexamethasone treatment was not exacerbated in the VCD+DEX group of rats. Premature ovarian failure did change neither the hepatic content of glycogen and triacylglycerol nor the glycerol release from perigonadal adipose tissue. Glucose intolerance was observed in the VCD group after an ipGTT (p<0.05), but not after an oral glucose challenge. Glucose intolerance and compensatory pancreatic β-cell mass caused by GC were not modified by ovarian failure in the VCD+DEX group. We conclude that reduced ovarian function has no major implications on the diabetogenic effects promoted by GC treatment, indicating that other factors related to aging may make rats more vulnerable to GC side effects on glucose metabolism.Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Relevant animal models can be useful for evaluating the impact of ovarian failure on bone loss. A chemically induced model of menopause in which mice gradually undergo ovarian failure yet retain residual ovarian tissue has been developed using the chemical  diepoxide (VCD). This study was designed to compare skeletal effects of VCD-induced ovarian failure to those associated with ovariectomy (OVX). Young (28 day) C57Bl/6Hsd female mice were dosed daily with vehicle or VCD (160 mg/kg/d, IP) for 15 days (n = 6-7/group) and monitored by vaginal cytology for ovarian failure. At the mean age of VCD-induced ovarian failure (approximately 6 wk after onset of dosing), a different group of mice was ovariectomized (OVX, n = 8). Spine BMD (SpBMD) was measured by DXA for 3 mo after ovarian failure and OVX. Mice were killed approximately 5 mo after ovarian failure or OVX, and bone architecture was evaluated by microCT ex vivo. In OVX mice, SpBMD was lower than controls 1 mo after OVX, whereas in VCD-treated mice, SpBMD was not lower than controls until 2.9 mo after ovarian failure (p < 0.05). Both VCD-induced ovarian failure and OVX led to pronounced deterioration of trabecular bone architecture, with slightly greater effects in OVX mice. At the femoral diaphysis, cortical bone area and thickness did not differ between VCD mice and controls but were decreased in OVX compared with both groups (p < 0.05). Circulating androstenedione levels were preserved in VCD-treated mice but reduced in OVX mice relative to controls (p < 0.001). These findings support that (1) VCD-induced ovarian failure leads to trabecular bone deterioration, (2) bone loss is attenuated by residual ovarian tissue, particularly in diaphyseal cortical bone, and (3) the VCD mouse model can be a relevant model for natural menopause in the study of associated bone disorders.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29797918>[Effects of electroacupuncture at "Zhongliao" (BL 33) and "Tianshu" (ST 25) on ovarian function in rats with premature ovarian insufficiency].</a></h2><p>To explore the effects of electroacupuncture (EA) at "Zhongliao" (BL 33) and "Tianshu" (ST 25) on ovarian function in rats with premature ovarian insufficiency (POI).A total of 48 SD female rats with regular estrus were divided into a blank group (=8), a model group (=10), an EA group (=10), a binding group (=10) and a tamoxifen (TAM) group (=10).

In previous studies, xenoestrogenic actions of parabens were reported in an immature rat model and a rat pituitary cell line (GH3 cells). The relationship between parabens and ovarian failure has not been described. In the present study, the influence of parabens on ovarian folliculogenesis and steroidogenesis was investigated. A disruptor of ovarian small pre-antral follicles,  diepoxide (VCD, 40 mg/kg), was used to induce premature ovarian failure (POF). Methylparaben (MP, 100 mg/kg), propylparaben (PP, 100 mg/kg), and butylparaben (BP, 100 mg/kg) dissolved in corn oil were treated in female 8-week-old Sprague-Dawley rat for 5 weeks. Estrus cycle status was checked daily by vaginal smear test. Ovarian follicle development and steroid synthesis were investigated through real-time PCR and histological analyses. Diestrus phases in the VCD, PP, and BP groups were longer than that in the vehicle group. VCD significantly decreased mRNA level of folliculogenesis-related genes (,  and ). All parabens significantly increased the  mRNA level but unchanged  and  acting in primordial follicles. VCD and MP slightly increased  and  levels, which are related to an initial step in steroidogenesis. VCD and parabens induced an increase in FSH levels in serum and significantly decreased the total number of follicles. Increased FSH implies impairment in ovarian function due to VCD or parabens. These results suggest that VCD may suppress both formation and development of follicles. In particular, combined administration of VCD and parabens accelerated inhibition of the follicle-developmental process through elevated AMH level in small antral follicles.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21570459>Estradiol treatment, physical activity, and muscle function in ovarian-senescent mice.</a></h2><p>Estradiol (E(2)) treatment in young adult, ovariectomized mice increases physical activity and reverses deleterious effects on skeletal muscle. Here we test the hypothesis that E(2) treatment improves muscle function and physical activity in aged, ovarian-senescent mice. Plasma E(2) levels and vaginal cytology confirmed ovarian senescence in 20-month-old C57BL/6 mice. Mice were then randomly divided into activity groups, having access to a running wheel or not, and further into those receiving E(2) or placebo. Placebo-treated mice wheel ran more than E(2)-treated mice (P=0.03), with no difference between treatment groups in cage activities such as time spent being active and ambulation distance (P≥0.55). Soleus muscles from aged mice that wheel ran adapted by getting larger and stronger, irrespective of E(2) status (P≤0.02). Soleus muscle fatigue resistance was greater in mice treated with E(2) (P=0.02), but maximal isometric tetanic force was not affected (P≥0.79). Because E(2) treatment did not improve physical activity or overall muscle function in the aged, ovarian-senescent mice as predicted, a second study was initiated to examine E(2) treatment of young adult mice prematurely ovarian senescent from exposure to the chemical,  diepoxide (VCD). Four-month-old C57BL/6 female mice were dosed with oil (control) or VCD. Vaginal cytology confirmed ovarian senescence in all mice treated with VCD 63 days after the onset of dosing, and then a subset of the VCD mice received E(2) (VCD+E(2)). Wheel running distance did not differ among control, VCD, and VCD+E(2) mice (P≥0.34). Soleus muscle concentric, isometric, and eccentric in vitro forces were greater in VCD+E(2) than in VCD mice (P<0.04), indicating beneficial estrogenic effects on muscle function. In general, aged and young mice with senescent ovaries were less responsive to E(2) treatment, in terms of physical activities and muscle function, than what has previously been shown for young, ovariectomized mice. These results bring forth the possibility that some component of the residual, follicle-depleted ovarian tissue influences physical activity in mice or that aging diminishes the responsiveness of skeletal muscle and related tissues to E(2) treatment.Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Studies suggest that the ovary can directly bioactivate VCH via CYP 2E1. The current study was designed to evaluate the role of ovarian CYP 2E1 in VCM-induced ovotoxicity. Postnatal day 4 B6C3F(1) and CYP 2E1 wild-type (+/+) and null (-/-) mouse ovaries were cultured (15 days) with VCD (30 microM), 1,2-VCM (125-1000 microM), or vehicle. Twenty-eight days female CYP 2E1 +/+ and -/- mice were dosed daily (15 days; ip) with VCH, 1,2-VCM, VCD or vehicle. Following culture or in vivo dosing, ovaries were histologically evaluated. In culture, VCD decreased (p<0.05) primordial and primary follicles in ovaries from all three groups of mice. 1,2-VCM decreased (p<0.05) primordial follicles in B6C3F(1) and CYP 2E1 +/+ ovaries, but not in CYP 2E1 -/- ovaries in culture. 1,2-VCM did not affect primary follicles in any group of mouse ovaries. Conversely, following in vivo dosing, primordial and primary follicles were reduced (p<0.05) by VCD and VCM in CYP2E1 +/+ and -/-, and by VCH in +/+ mice. The data demonstrate that, whereas in vitro ovarian bioactivation of VCM requires CYP 2E1 enzyme, in vivo CYP 2E1 plays a minimal role. Thus, the findings support that hepatic  dominates the contribution made by the ovary in bioactivation of VCM to its ovotoxic metabolite, VCD. This study also demonstrates the use of a novel ovarian culture system to evaluate ovary-specific  of xenobiotics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11215690>Ovarian toxicity of  diepoxide: a mechanistic model.</a></h2><p>Female mammals are born with a finite number of ovarian primordial follicles that cannot be regenerated; thus, chemicals that destroy oocytes contained in these follicles can produce premature ovarian failure (early menopuase in women). Exposure of women to known ovotoxicants, such as contaminants in cigarette smoke, is associated with early menopause. Thus, the potential risks posed by ovotoxic chemicals is of concern. Our studies have focused on the environmental chemical  (VCH), which is produced during the manufacture of rubber tires, flame retardants, insecticides, plasticizers, and antioxidants. Dosing of female rats and mice with the ovotoxic diepoxide metabolite of VCH,  diepoxide (VCD), for 30 days destroyed the majority of ovarian primordial follicles. Using VCD in rats as a generalized model for ovotoxicity, we determined that 1) repeated daily dosing is required, 2) cell death is via apoptosis, and 3) altered expression of specific genes is involved. An integrated approach at the morphologic, biochemical, and molecular level was used to support these conclusions. Studies in isolated rat small preantral follicles (targeted for VCD-induced ovotoxicity) focused on the role of cell death genes, mitochondrion-associated events, and VCD . We also evaluated how this information relates to human risk for early menopause. These animal research results provide a better understanding of the potential risk of human exposure to environmental ovarian toxicants and greater insight as to the impact of these toxicants on reproductive health in women.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12488331>Bax, caspase-2, and caspase-3 are required for ovarian follicle loss caused by  diepoxide exposure of female mice in vivo.</a></h2><p>The industrial chemical,  diepoxide (VCD), kills oocytes within immature follicles in the ovaries of mice and rats and is considered a potential occupational health hazard. It has been reported that VCD-induced follicle loss occurs via a cell death process involving elevated expression of Bax, a proapoptotic Bcl-2 family member, and increased caspase-3-like activity. We have previously shown that oocytes lacking acid sphingomyelinase (ASMase; an enzyme that generates the proapoptotic stress sensor ceramide), the aromatic hydrocarbon receptor (Ahr), Bax, or caspase-2 are resistant to apoptosis induced by other chemical toxicants. Therefore, this study was designed to investigate the functional importance of ASMase, Ahr, Bax, and caspase-2 as well as the related executioner enzyme caspase-3 to VCD-induced ovotoxicity in mice using gene knockout technology. For each gene mutant mouse line, wild-type and homozygous-null female siblings derived from heterozygous matings were given once-daily ip injections of either vehicle (sesame oil) or VCD (80 mg/kg body weight) for 15 d (three or four mice per treatment group per genotype). Ovaries were collected 24 h after the final injection and analyzed for the total number of nonatretic primordial and primary follicles remaining per ovary. No differences in the extent of primordial or primary follicle destruction resulting from VCD exposure were observed in wild-type vs. ASMase- or Ahr-deficient mice. By contrast, the extent of VCD-induced primordial follicle depletion in Bax-deficient mice (45 +/- 11%) was significantly (P < 0.05) lower than that in wild-type females (85 +/- 2%). The extent of primary follicle loss in bax-null mice exposed to VCD (3 +/- 22%) was also significantly (P < 0.05) lower than that in their wild-type sisters (86 +/- 4%). In caspase-2-deficient mice, significantly (P < 0.05) fewer oocyte-containing primary follicles were destroyed by VCD (17 +/- 19%) vs. wild-type controls (71 +/- 6%); however, no significant difference in the extent of VCD-induced primordial follicle destruction was observed in caspase-2-null vs. wild-type females. Finally, in caspase-3-deficient mice, significantly (P < 0.05) fewer oocyte-containing primary follicles were destroyed by VCD (33 +/- 3%) vs. wild-type controls (71 +/- 2%); however, no significant difference in the extent of VCD-induced primordial follicle destruction was observed in caspase-3-null vs. wild-type females. We conclude that Bax, caspase-2, and caspase-3, but not ASMase or Ahr, are functionally important in VCD-induced follicle loss. However, as a loss of Bax, caspase-2, or caspase-3 function conveyed only partial protection from the ovotoxic effects of VCD, other cell death  that either function independently of Bax, caspase-2, and caspase-3 or are not apoptotic in nature are also involved.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8555412>Ovarian toxicity of  and related olefins in B6C3F1 mice: role of diepoxides.</a></h2><p> (VCH) is an ovarian toxicant in mice. Studies have established that bioactivation of VCH to epoxides is required for its ovotoxicity, with vinylcyclohexene diepoxide being the most potent epoxide of VCH in terms of follicular depletion. To determine the role of the diepoxide in the ovarian toxicity of VCH and related compounds, a structure-activity study was conducted. Following administration (ip) of VCH for 30 days, a significant depletion of ovarian follicles was observed. No alteration of small ovarian follicle counts occurred following treatment with structural analogues of VCH (vinylcyclohexane, ethylcyclohexene, and cyclohexene) that contain only a single unsaturated site. These VCH analogues were converted to monoepoxides both in vitro and in vivo. In addition, when the monoepoxide forms of the VCH analogues were administered to mice, they were not ovotoxic. These results indicate that vinylcyclohexene diepoxide may be the ultimate ovotoxic metabolite of VCH. A diepoxide was also shown to be critical for butadiene- and isoprene-induced follicular loss. Butadiene monoepoxide, butadiene diepoxide, and isoprene were ovotoxic. In contrast, the monoepoxide, epoxybutane, was not ovotoxic. The ovotoxicity of these compounds correlated with their chemical reactivity as assessed by alkylation of nicotinamide. Vinylcyclohexene diepoxide and butadiene diepoxide had a 3.5- to 10-fold higher chemical reactivity as compared to their monoepoxide precursors and structurally related monoepoxides. Thus, a relationship exists between chemical reactivity and ovotoxicity. Only those compounds which are metabolized to a diepoxide or are a diepoxide were ovotoxic. The formation of these diepoxide metabolites may in turn be linked to the ovarian toxicity and carcinogenicity of these olefins.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16422148>Characterization of cyclicity and hormonal profile with impending ovarian failure in a novel chemical-induced mouse model of perimenopause.</a></h2><p> diepoxide (VCD) causes early, gradual ovarian failure in mice because it specifically targets small pre-antral ovarian follicles. The period between loss of these follicles and ovarian failure is analogous to perimenopause in women. We sought to characterize the period of onset of ovarian failure in VCD-treated mice in regard to estrous cycle length and hormonal changes. Female C57Bl/6 mice (age, 28 days) were dosed daily for 15 days with VCD (160 mg/kg intraperitoneally) to cause early ovarian failure or with vehicle only (control animals). Cycle length was monitored by vaginal cytology. Plasma levels of 17beta-estradiol (E2), progesterone (P4), and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) in control and VCD-treated animals were measured during proestrus of cycles 1 through 12. Cycle length (mean, 5.8 days) did not differ between groups for cycles 1 through 4. In contrast, cycle length during cycles 5 through 12 was increased (mean length, 10.9 days; P < 0.05 versus control) in VCD-treated animals, which also showed an apparent increase in plasma FSH levels. Plasma E2 and P4 at proestrus did not differ between groups during any cycle. Ovarian failure in VCD-treated mice was confirmed by histological evaluation on day 156 after onset of dosing, whereas control animals were still cycling. Therefore, despite compromised cycle length in VCD-treated mice, peak ovarian steroid production in preovulatory follicles at proestrus is adequate. These results demonstrate that the VCD-treated mouse can serve as an appropriate model to mimic hormonal changes during the perimenopausal transition in women.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12693031>Stereochemical aspects in the  biotransformation with rat liver microsomes and purified cytochrome P450s: diepoxide formation and hydrolysis.</a></h2><p>The stereochemical course of the biotransformation of 1,2-monoepoxides of  (2 and 3) by liver microsomes from control and induced rats and by purified P4502B1 and P4502E1 has been determined. The epoxidation of monoexpodies cis- 1,2-epoxide (2) and trans- 1,2-epoxide (3) gives the corresponding eight isomeric diepoxides cis- diepoxide (9) and trans- diepoxide (10). The stereoselectivity of this process is affected by P450 induction. Phenobarbital is able to enhance the yield of epoxidation to give preferentially diepoxide (1R, 2S, 4R, 7R)-trans-10b. This enantiomer is also formed as nearly the sole product by P450-catalyzed epoxidation of (1R,2S,4R)-trans-3b, the monoepoxide that, as a consequence of the selective formation from  and/or reduced elimination by epoxide hydrolase, tends to accumulate in rat. Also, the P4502B1 but not 2E1, in a reconstituted system, is able to perform the epoxidation of (1R,2S,4R)-trans-3b to produce selectively the same diepoxide. Diepoxides cis-9 and trans-10 are biotransformed by mEH catalyzed hydrolysis. Although the hydrolysis of diepoxides 9 is characterized by a lower substrate enantioselection, the reaction of diepoxides 10 occurs with a good substrate enantioselectivity favoring the hydrolysis of the epoxides (1R,2S,4R,7S)-trans-10b and (1S,2R,4S,7S)-trans-10a. Diepoxide (1R,2S,4R,7R)-trans-10b is therefore the isomer primarily formed by P450-catalyzed oxidation of monoepoxide trans-3, and it is also the compound showing the lower propensity to undergo mEH-catalyzed hydrolysis. On the basis of this result, the ovotoxicity of  is expected to be due to the stereoisomer diepoxide (1R,2S,4R,7R)-trans-10b, whose biological reactivity, via cross-linking, may be strongly different to the other isomer diepoxides, being dependent by its specific conformation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7245235>Effects of  and its main oxirane metabolite on mouse hepatic microsomal enzymes and glutathione levels.</a></h2><p>When  (VCHE) and  monoxide (VCM) were administered to mice at 500 mg/kg, cytochrome P-450, cytochrome b5, NADPH-cytochrome c reductase and aminopyrine-N-demethylase and epoxide hydrolase were induced.

Furthermore, recent studies suggest that changes in hormone levels during perimenopause may influence disease development. Injection of  diepoxide (VCD) in B(6)C(3)F(1) mice induces gradual ovarian failure, preserving both the perimenopausal (peri-ovarian failure) and menopausal (post-ovarian failure) periods. To address the impact of the transition into menopause on the development of diabetes and diabetic kidney damage, we used streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes in the VCD model of menopause. After 6 wk of STZ-induced diabetes, blood glucose was significantly increased in post-ovarian failure (post-OF) diabetic mice compared with cycling diabetic mice. In peri-ovarian failure (peri-OF) diabetic mice, blood glucose levels trended higher but were not significantly different from cycling diabetic mice, suggesting a continuum of worsening blood glucose across the menopausal transition. Cell proliferation, an early marker of damage in the kidney, was increased in post-OF diabetic mice compared with cycling diabetic mice, as measured by PCNA immunohistochemistry. In post-OF diabetic mice, mRNA abundance of early growth response-1 (Egr-1), collagen-4alpha1, and matrix metalloproteinase-9 were increased and 3beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 4 (3beta-HSD4) and transforming growth factor-beta(2) (TGF-beta(2)) were decreased compared with cycling diabetic mice. In peri-OF diabetic mice, mRNA abundance of Egr-1 and 3beta-HSD4 were increased, and TGF-beta(2) was decreased compared with cycling diabetic mice. This study highlights the importance and utility of the VCD model of menopause, as it provides a physiologically relevant system for determining the impact of the menopausal transition on diabetes and diabetic kidney damage.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11452144>Effect of  diepoxide dosing in rats on GSH levels in liver and ovaries.</a></h2><p>Repeated daily dosing of rats with the occupational chemical 4- vinylcyclohexene or its diepoxide metabolite (VCD) for 15 days destroys the smallest ovarian follicles. VCD acutely reduced hepatic levels of the antioxidant, glutathione (GSH); therefore, these studies were designed to evaluate whether GSH concentrations mediate VCD-induced ovotoxicity. Immature female Fischer 344 rats were dosed once or daily for 15 days with VCD (0.57 mmol/kg, ip) or the GSH synthesis inhibitor buthionine sulfoximine (BSO, 2 mmol/kg, ip). Animals were euthanized 2, 6, or 26 h following a single dose, and 2 or 26 h following 15 days of daily dosing. Reduced (p < 0.05) hepatic GSH was seen within 2 h of a single dose of either VCD (51 +/- 5% of control) or BSO (42 +/- 9%), but only BSO reduced ovarian GSH (71 +/- 5% at 6 h, p = 0.05) as measured by HPLC. Within 26 h, GSH levels had returned to control levels with either treatment. Hepatic GSH levels were reduced (< 0.05) 2 h after 15 daily doses with BSO (42 +/- 5%) or VCD (70 +/- 4%), but only BSO decreased ovarian GSH (64 +/- 3%). GSH levels in 15-day tissues were similar to controls 26 h after the final dose. Neither BSO nor VCD increased hepatic or ovarian concentrations of the oxidized dimer of GSH (GSSG) or thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS), indicators of oxidative stress. These results suggest these treatments did not cause an oxidative stress. Histological counts of ovarian small follicle numbers were reduced (p < 0.05) in 15-day VCD-treated rats, whereas BSO did not affect follicle numbers, even though BSO reduced ovarian GSH content. These results support the conclusion that alterations in ovarian GSH levels are not involved in VCD-induced ovotoxicity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23362124>Two-photon excited fluorescence imaging of endogenous contrast in a mouse model of ovarian cancer.</a></h2><p>Ovarian cancer has an extremely high mortality rate resulting from poor understanding of the disease. In order to aid understanding of disease etiology and progression, we identify the endogenous fluorophores present in a mouse model of ovarian cancer and describe changes in fluorophore abundance and distribution with age and disease.A mouse model of ovarian cancer was created by dosing with  diepoxide, which induces follicular apoptosis (simulating menopause), and 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene, a known carcinogen. Imaging of ovarian tissue was completed ex vivo with a multiphoton microscope using excitation wavelength of 780 nm and emission collection from 405 to 505 nm. Two-photon excited fluorescence images and corresponding histologic sections with selective stains were used to identify endogenous fluorophores.The majority of collected fluorescence emission was attributed to NADH and lipofuscin, with additional contributions from collagen and elastin. Dim cellular fluorescence from NADH did not show observable changes with age. Changes in ovarian morphology with disease development frequently caused increased fluorescence contributions from collagen and adipose tissue-associated NADH. Lipofuscin fluorescence was much brighter than NADH fluorescence and increased as a function of both age and disease.Our finding of NADH fluorescence patterns similar to that seen previously in human ovary, combined with the observation of lipofuscin accumulation with age and disease also seen in human organs, suggests that the findings from this model may be relevant to human ovarian disease. Increased lipofuscin fluorescence might be used as an indicator of disease in the ovary and this finding warrants further study.Copyright © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29738870>Comparison of transitional vs surgical menopause on monoamine and amino acid levels in the rat brain.</a></h2><p>Loss of ovarian function has important effects on neurotransmitter production and release with corresponding effects on cognitive performance. To date, there has been little direct comparison of the effects of surgical and transitional menopause on neurotransmitter  in the brain. In this study, effects on monoamines, monoamine metabolites, and the amino acids tryptophan (TRP) and tyrosine (TYR) were evaluated in adult ovariectomized (OVX) rats and in rats that underwent selective and gradual ovarian follicle depletion by daily injection of -diepoxide (VCD). Tissues from the hippocampus (HPC), frontal cortex (FCX), and striatum (STR) were dissected and analyzed at 1- and 6-weeks following OVX or VCD treatments. Tissues from gonadally intact rats were collected at proestrus and diestrus to represent neurochemical levels during natural states of high and low estrogens. In gonadally intact rats, higher levels of serotonin (5-HT) were detected at proestrus than at diestrus in the FCX. In addition, the ratio of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA)/5HT in the FCX and HPC was lower at proestrus than at diestrus, suggesting an effect on 5-HT turnover in these regions. No other significant differences between proestrus and diestrus were observed. In OVX- and VCD-treated rats, changes were observed which were both brain region- and time point-dependent. In the HPC levels of norepinephrine, 5-HIAA, TRP and TYR were significantly reduced at 1 week, but not 6 weeks, in both OVX and VCD-treated rats relative to proestrus and diestrus. In the FCX, dopamine levels were elevated at 6 weeks after OVX relative to diestrus. A similar trend was observed at 1 week (but not 6 weeks) following VCD treatment. In the STR, norepinephrine levels were elevated at 1 week following OVX, and HVA levels were elevated at 1 week, but not 6 weeks, following VCD treatment, relative to proestrus and diestrus. Collectively, these data provide the first comprehensive analysis comparing the effects of two models of menopause on multiple neuroendocrine endpoints in the brain. These effects likely contribute to effects of surgical and transitional menopause on brain function and cognitive performance that have been reported.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

We investigated the hypothesis if raloxifene, a selective oestrogen receptor modulator, could be employed to prevent behavioural seizures and morphological alterations in a mouse model mimicking epilepsy in postmenopausal women. Female mice were made ovotoxic by treatment with  diepoxide (VCD) to mimic a postmenopausal state. They were then subjected to kainic acid (KA)-induced seizures and neurotoxicity, as assessed by microscopic examination of hippocampus, relevant to human temporal lobe epilepsy. VCD administration (for 15days followed by a drug-free period of 30days) induced ovotoxicity in mice as evidenced by reduced number of primary ovarian follicles. This was accompanied by a 62.4% reduction in serum oestradiol levels. The bone mineral density of ovotoxic mice, however, remained unaffected. Raloxifene (8mg/kg) reduced the seizure severity score in both normal and ovotoxic mice and protected against degeneration induced by KA in the CA3, CA1 sub-fields and hilus of the DG. Hippocampal TGF-β3 levels were not affected by any of the treatments. We show the potential protective role of raloxifene in preventing seizures and neuronal damage in a mouse model mimicking epilepsy in postmenopausal women which was found unrelated to hippocampal TGF-β3. Raloxifene might represent a novel therapeutic option for postmenopausal temporal lobe epileptic woman.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Xenobiotic exposures can destroy primordial follicles resulting in premature ovarian failure and, consequently, early entry into menopause. A number of chemical classes can induce premature ovarian failure, including environmental, chemotherapeutic and industrial exposures. While our knowledge on the mechanistic events that occur in the ovary with chemical exposures is increasing, our understanding of the ovary's capacity to metabolize such compounds is less established.

The mechanisms that control atresia and VCD-induced toxicity are unknown; however, they could involve 17beta-E2. Atresia slows as animals enter puberty, whereas circulating E2 levels increase with the the onset of cyclicity. This inverse relationship suggests that E2 may be involved in the control of atresia. Therefore, this study was designed to determine whether treatment of immature rats with E2 could protect follicles normally destroyed by VCD-induced apoptosis. Female F344 rats were treated daily with E2, ER analogs, and/or VCD for 15 d. VCD alone caused a 50% reduction in primordial and primary follicles. Coinjection of E2 (0.1 mg/kg) and VCD (80 mg/kg) selectively protected primary follicles from VCD-induced follicle loss. This protection was mimicked by an ER agonist, genistein (0.1 mg/kg), and prevented by an ER antagonist, 4-hydroxytamoxifen (2 mg/kg). VCD treatment increased caspase-3-like activity, whereas concurrent treatment with genistein and VCD restored caspase-3-like activity to control levels. VCD treatment had no effect on circulating E2 levels, uterine weight, or E2 binding to the ER, nor could it directly displace E2 from ERbeta. These observations support the idea that ER-mediated protection against VCD-induced follicle toxicity is obtained by reducing apoptosis in small preantral follicles, although VCD does not appear to directly interact with ER.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17661298>Gold(I)-catalyzed asymmetric cycloisomerization of eneallenes into vinylcyclohexenes.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20816688>Distribution and responsiveness of rat anti-Müllerian hormone during ovarian development and VCD-induced ovotoxicity.</a></h2><p>Anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) is produced by granulosa cells in primary to small antral follicles of the adult ovary and helps maintain primordial follicles in a dormant state. The industrial chemical,  diepoxide (VCD) causes specific ovotoxicity in primordial and small primary follicles of mice and rats. Previous studies suggest that this ovotoxicity involves acceleration of primordial to primary follicle recruitment via interactions with the Kit/Kit ligand signaling pathway. Because of its accepted role in inhibiting primordial follicle recruitment, the present study was designed to investigate a possible interaction between AMH and VCD-induced ovotoxicity. Protein distribution of AMH was compared in neonatal and adult F344 rat ovaries. AMH protein was visualized by immunofluorescence microscopy in large primary and secondary follicles of the adult ovary, but in small primary follicles in neonatal rat ovaries. In cultured postnatal day (PND) 4 F344 rat ovaries, VCD exposure (30 μM, 2-8 days) decreased (P<0.05) AMH mRNA (d4-8) and protein (d6-8). Recombinant AMH (100-400 mg/ml) in PND4 ovaries cultured 8 days±VCD (30 μM) caused an increase (P<0.05) in primordial, and a decrease (P<0.05) in small primary follicles, supporting that AMH retarded primordial follicle recruitment. However, no concentration of AMH had an effect on VCD-induced ovotoxicity. Whereas, VCD caused a reduction in expression of AMH (d4-d8), it followed previously reported initial disruptions in Kit signaling induced by VCD (d2). Thus, collectively, these results do not support a mechanism whereby VCD causes ovotoxicity via generalized activation of primordial follicle recruitment, but instead provide further support for the specificity of other intracellular mechanisms involved in VCD-induced ovotoxicity.Copyright © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Its analog, 4-phenylcyclohexene (4PC), is a volatile product from latex-backed carpeting. These studies were undertaken to assess the structure-activity relationships of these compounds and the potential for 4PC to cause ovotoxicity. Female B6C3F1 mice were dosed with VCH (6 mmol/kg/day, ip) or 4PC (3 or 6 mmol/kg/day, ip) daily for 30 days. Treatment with VCH caused dramatic reductions in small and growing follicles as compared to those of vehicle controls. No treatment-related ovarian lesions were associated with 4PC administration. Plasma FSH concentrations were unaltered by treatment with either compound. These results indicate that in mice, the substitution of the phenyl for the vinyl group in the 4 position eliminates the ovotoxicity caused by this class of compounds. Presumably, the ability of the vinyl group to form an epoxide (or dihydrodiol) and/or its smaller size accounts for this difference in ovarian toxicity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10438657>A single dose of the ovotoxicant  diepoxide is protective in rat primary ovarian follicles.</a></h2><p>Repeated dosing of rats with the ovotoxic chemical,  diepoxide (VCD), destroys primordial and primary ovarian follicles via apoptosis (physiological cell death) by accelerating the normal rate of atresia. The present study investigated the effect of a single dose (1x) of VCD. Immature (d28) female Fischer 344 rats were dosed 1x or 15x with VCD (80 mg/kg ip). Ovaries were collected 24 h or 15 days following 1x VCD or after 15x for classification and evaluation. Following 1x VCD the number of healthy primary follicles was greater (p < 0.05) than control 24 h and 15 days later. This effect reflected a slowing of the normal rate of atresia seen in control ovaries. There was no effect of a single dose on primordial or growing follicles at any time. Expression of mRNA encoding the cell death gene bax was reduced (p < 0.05) on d1 after 1x VCD in isolated primordial and primary follicles. These observations were in contrast to a decreased (p < 0. 05) number of healthy primary and primordial follicles in ovaries and increased (p < 0.05) bax mRNA in isolated follicles from rats dosed 15x for 15 days. Immunofluorescence staining revealed that, the distribution of Bax protein was similar between ovaries from controls and 1x or 15x VCD-treated rats. These data provide evidence for a "protective" response against the normal rate of atresia in primary ovarian follicles following exposure to 1x VCD. Additionally, changes in expression of bax mRNA paralleled alterations in the rate of atresia.Copyright 1999 Academic Press.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2068732>Epoxidation of  by human hepatic microsomes.</a></h2><p>Carcinogenicity studies have shown that chronic administration of  (VCH) will induce ovarian tumors in B6C3F1 mice but not F-344 rats. This occurs because the blood level of the ovotoxic VCH metabolite, VCH-1,2-epoxide, is dramatically higher in VCH-treated female mice compared with rats. This species difference in VCH epoxidation is also reflected in the rate of VCH  by hepatic microsomes (female mouse greater than female rat). The present study assessed the ability of microsomes obtained from human liver to metabolize VCH to epoxides since humans are exposed to VCH in certain occupational settings. The production of VCH-1,2-epoxide and VCH-7,8-epoxide from VCH (1 mM) by human hepatic microsomes was linear with respect to microsomal protein concentration (0.25-1.0 mg/ml) and incubation time (5-20 min). VCH-1,2-epoxide was the major metabolite, while the rate VCH-7,8-epoxide formation was about 6-fold lower and in some cases was below the limit of detection. There was no dramatic difference in the rate of VCH epoxidation by hepatic microsomes obtained from male and female humans. The rate of VCH-1,2-epoxide formation by female human hepatic microsomes was 0.71 +/- 0.35 nmol/mg microsomal protein/min (n = 4). This is 13- and 2-fold lower than the rate of VCH-1,2-epoxide formation by female mouse and rat hepatic microsomes, respectively. Therefore, if the rate of hepatic VCH epoxidation is the main factor which determines the ovotoxicity of VCH, then the results of these studies suggest that rats are the more appropriate animal model for extrapolation of animal data to humans.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3465684>.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12161346>In vitro ovarian tissue and organ culture: a review.</a></h2><p>Many investigations have utilized techniques for culturing ovarian tissue or isolated follicles in vitro.

Adaptations of this technique include incubation of ovaries in a chamber continuously perfused with medium or perfusion of medium through the intact vasculature. Late follicular development, ovulation, and steroidogenesis can also be examined in these systems. Another approach has been to culture individual follicles isolated by enzymatic or mechanical dissociation. The majority of this research has focused on improving follicular development in vitro. This review will discuss these various culture techniques and some of the results that have been acquired. Recent results from toxicological studies utilizing whole ovarian cultures performed will also be described.

These epoxides deplete primordial and primary follicles. The current studies compared in vitro epoxidation of (R)-VCH with that of (S)-VCH in hepatic microsomes prepared from adult female B6C3F(1) mice and Fischer 344 rats. Bioactivation of VCH in the rat was significantly less compared with that in the mouse. (R)-VCH formed significantly more VCH-1,2-epoxide as compared with (S)-VCH in both species, and less VCH-7,8-epoxide in the mouse. Neither of the enantiomers formed detectable amounts of VCD in the mouse or rat. Hepatic microsomes prepared from mice and rats pretreated with CYP-inducing agents (phenobarbital and acetone) were also incubated with (R)-VCH or (S)-VCH. Although monoepoxide formation was not increased enantioselectively in the mouse, VCD was formed preferentially from (R)-VCH as compared with (S)-VCH. Pretreatment with VCH resulted in nonstereoselective increases in both monoepoxide and diepoxide formation. In the rat, these pretreatments resulted in nonstereoselective increases in monoepoxide formation, but VCD formation was not detectable. Incubations with human CYP2E1 enzyme revealed that (R)-VCH formed significantly more VCH-1,2-epoxide and less VCH-7,8-epoxide than (S)-VCH. Human CYP2A6 was limited in its ability to form epoxides from either enantiomer of VCH. Human CYP2B6 preferentially formed VCH-7,8-epoxide compared with VCH-1,2-epoxide, and to a greater extent from (R)-VCH than from (S)-VCH.

The effect of American ginseng and its underlying mechanisms in preventing and treating premature ovarian failure (POF) was studied in female Sprague-Dawley rats where POF was induced by ip administration of  diepoxide (VCD). Rat behavior, serum hormone levels, ovarian and uterine size, pathological features, and ovarian tissue expression of genes associated with POF were assessed in controls, untreated POF model rats, and POF model rats treated with low- (1.125 g/kg), medium- (2.25 g/kg), and high-dose (4.5 g/kg) American ginseng. Compared with untreated POF model rats, those treated with medium- and high-dose American ginseng had more stable behavior and better coat appearance as well as serum hormone levels closer to those in control rats. Moreover, treatment with medium- or high-dose American ginseng increased ovarian and uterine size. Hematoxylin and eosin-staining revealed mature follicles and endometrium with an alternating concave/convex surface structure with visible capillaries and glands in ginseng- treated POF rats. PLA2G4A expression was positively correlated with POF, while the expression levels of PAPPA, STC2, CCL2, and NELL1 were negatively correlated with POF. Our study showed that American ginseng may effectively prevent POF and alleviate POF symptoms by regulating serum hormone levels and altering the expression levels of genes related to POF in ovarian tissue.© 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22061827>Ovarian expressed microsomal epoxide hydrolase: role in detoxification of  diepoxide and regulation by phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase signaling.</a></h2><p> diepoxide (VCD) is a metabolite of  (VCH) which has the potential to be formed in the ovary through CYP2E1 activity. VCD specifically destroys primordial and small primary follicles in the rodent ovary. Mouse ovaries exposed to VCD demonstrate increased mRNA and protein expression of microsomal epoxide hydrolase (mEH), and an inactive tetrol metabolite (4-(1,2-dihydroxy)ethyl-1,2-dihydroxycyclohexane) can be formed in mouse ovarian follicles, potentially through detoxification action of mEH. In contrast, mEH can bioactivate another ovotoxic chemical, 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA) to a more toxic compound, DMBA-3,4-diol-1,2-epoxide. Thus, the present study evaluated a functional role for mEH during detoxification of VCD. Additionally, because inhibition of the phosphatidyinositol-3 kinase (PI3K) signaling pathway in a previous study protected primordial follicles from VCD-induced destruction, but accelerated DMBA-induced ovotoxicity, a role for PI3K in ovarian mEH regulation was evaluated. Using a post-natal day (PND) 4 Fischer 344 rat whole ovary culture system inhibition of mEH using cyclohexene oxide during VCD exposure resulted in a greater (P<0.05) loss of primordial and small primary follicles relative to VCD-treated ovaries. Also, relative to controls, meh mRNA was increased (P<0.05) on day 4 of VCD (30 μM) exposure, followed by increased (P<0.05) mEH protein after 6 days. Furthermore, inhibition of PI3K signaling increased mEH mRNA and protein expression. Thus, these results support a functional role for mEH in the rat ovary, and demonstrate the involvement of PI3K signaling in regulation of ovarian xenobiotic  by mEH.Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Development, maturation, and ovulation of oocytes occur within ovarian follicles. Females are born with a finite number of undeveloped, primordial follicles. Chemicals that destroy oocytes contained in these follicles can produce premature ovarian failure (menopause) because once a primordial follicle is destroyed, it cannot be replaced. This article focuses on chemicals that have been shown to destroy these small follicles in laboratory animals. An ovotoxic compound of particular interest is  (VCH) and its epoxide metabolites. The specific information discussed here relates to various aspects of VCH-inuced ovarian toxicity. This includes species specificity, disposition and , direct follicular effects, bioactivity of metabolites, and long-term responses to exposure.

Utilizing a recently described ovotoxin-induced animal model of perimenopause characterized by a prolonged estrogen-replete period of elevated FSH, we examined longitudinal changes in bone mineral density (BMD) and their association with FSH. Additionally, serum inhibin levels were assessed to determine whether elevated FSH occurred secondary to decreased ovarian inhibin production and, if so, whether inhibins also correlated with BMD. BMD of the distal femur was assessed using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) over 19 months in Sprague-Dawley rats treated at 1 month with vehicle or  diepoxide (VCD, 80 or 160 mg/kg daily). Serum FSH, inhibins A and B, and 17-ß estradiol (E(2)) were assayed and estrus cyclicity was assessed. VCD caused dose-dependent increases in FSH that exceeded values occurring with natural senescence, hastening the onset and prolonging the duration of persistent estrus, an acyclic but E(2)-replete period. VCD decreased serum inhibins A and B, which were inversely correlated with FSH (r(2) = 0.30 and 0.12, respectively). In VCD rats, significant decreases in BMD (5-13%) occurred during periods of increased FSH and decreased inhibins, while BMD was unchanged in controls. In skeletally mature rats, FSH (r(2) = 0.13) and inhibin A (r(2) = 0.15) correlated with BMD, while inhibin B and E(2) did not. Thus, for the first time, both the hormonal milieu of perimenopause and the association of dynamic perimenopausal changes in FSH and inhibin A with decreased BMD have been reproduced in an animal model.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27456335>Danzhi Qing'e (DZQE) activates AMPK pathway and regulates lipid metabolism in a rat model of perimenopausal hyperlipidaemia.</a></h2><p>What is the central question of this study? Does Danzhi Qing'e (DZQE) regulate lipid metabolism and improve ovarian function in a rat model of perimenopausal hyperlipidaemia, and could this effect be mediated through the AMPK pathway? What is the main finding and its importance? We revealed that DZQE is a pharmacotherapy that could activate the AMPK pathway to improve ovarian function and lipid metabolism during perimenopause complicated with hyperlipidaemia syndrome in an animal model. Thus, this study provides a novel therapeutic option for treating perimenopausal syndrome and highlights the therapeutic potential of DZQE in perimenopausal rats. Menopause is an important event in a woman's life. During perimenopause, accompanied by development of osteoporosis and dyslipidaemia, ovarian function gradually declines. Dyslipidaemia is a risk factor for cardiovascular disorders, cerebrovascular disease and breast cancer in postmenopausal women. All of these contribute to impairment of liver function, particularly fatty liver disease, because liver dysfunction is associated with ovarian dysfunction and hyperlipidaemia. The aim of this study was to define a therapeutic approach to improve ovarian function and attenuate lipid accumulation in order to prevent perimenopause-induced ovarian dysfunction and hyperlipidaemia. Four-week-old female Wistar rats were injected i.p. with  diepoxide (4-VCD) and fed with a high-fat diet (HFD) to serve as a model of perimenopause complicated with hyperlipidaemia. The 4-VCD induces perimenopause, while the HFD causes hyperlipidaemia. Five days after administration of 4-VCD, the 4-VCD + HFD-treated rats were assessed daily for oestrous cycle stage by vaginal cytology. Rats were then assigned into groups, in which 2.5, 5.0 or 10.0 g kg Danzhi Qing'e (DZQE) or estradiol valerate was administered intragastrically for 8 weeks. Expression levels of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), oestrogen and testosterone measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay served as biomarkers for perimenopause and ovarian dysfunction. The expression levels of AMPK and acetyl-CoA carboxylase in the liver were determined with Western blotting, and aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase were analysed using an automated biochemical analyser to examine liver function. The DZQE improved ovarian function by upregulating oestrogen and testosterone concentrations in serum and downregulating FSH and LH serum concentrations. Moreover, DZQE reduced serum concentrations of triglyceride, total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein in a dose-dependent manner to regulate lipid levels during perimenopause. Furthermore, DZQE increased AMPK at both the transcriptional and translational levels and decreased the expression of SREBP-1c gene as well as its downstream target gene, fatty acid synthase. Danzhi Qing'e improved dyslipidaemia during menopause and also had an effect on liver function. Danzhi Qing'e is an effective Chinese herbal compound, which improves ovarian function and lipid metabolism in perimenopause complicated with hyperlipidaemia at least in part through the AMPK pathway.© 2016 The Authors.

VCD-induced ovotoxicity is specific for small preantral follicles and is associated with increased activity of caspase cascades. The present study was designed to investigate the alteration of expression and distribution of several Bcl-2 family member proteins induced by dosing of VCD in rat small ovarian follicles. Female F344 rats were given a single dose of VCD (80 mg/kg, i.p., 1 day; a time when ovotoxicity is not initiated), or dosed daily for 15 days (80 mg/kg, i.p., 15 days; a time when significant ovotoxicity is underway). Four hours following the final dose, livers and ovaries were collected. Ovarian small (25-100 microm) and large (100-250 microm) preantral follicles were isolated, and subcellular fractions (cytosolic and mitochondrial) were prepared. Compared with controls, levels of the proapoptotic protein, Bad, were greater in both cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions of small preantral follicles collected from 15-day VCD-treated rats (cytosol, 1.97 +/- 0.16; mitochondria, 2.20 +/- 0.24, VCD/control, P < 0.05). After 15 days of daily VCD dosing, total cellular antiapoptotic Bcl-x(L) protein levels were unaffected in small preantral follicles, but its distribution in mitochondrial and cytosolic components was altered (mitochondria, 0.635 +/- 0.08; cytosol, 1.39 +/- 0.14, VCD/control, P < 0.05). Likewise, VCD did not affect protein levels of proapoptotic Bax in small follicles on Day 15. However, consistent with a Bax-mediated mechanism of apoptosis, the relative ratio of Bax/Bcl-x(L) in the mitochondrial fraction of small preantral follicles was significantly increased by VCD dosing (1.62 +/- 0.21, VCD/control, P < 0.05). Immunofluorescence staining intensity evaluated by confocal microscopy visualized cytochrome c protein in the cytosolic compartment in granulosa cells of preantral follicles in various stages of development. Relative to controls, within the population of small preantral follicles, staining intensity was less (P < 0.05) and presumably more diffuse, specifically in stage 1 primary follicles from VCD-treated animals (15 days). VCD caused none of these effects in large preantral follicles or liver (not targeted by VCD). These data provide evidence that the apoptosis induced by VCD in ovarian small preantral follicles of rats is associated with increased expression of Bad protein, redistribution of Bcl-x(L) protein and cytochrome c from the mitochondria to the cytosolic compartment, and an increase in the Bax/Bcl-x(L) ratio in the mitochondria. These observations are consistent with the involvement of Bcl-2 gene family members in VCD-induced acceleration of atresia.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20158943>7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene induces sertoli-leydig-cell tumors in the follicle-depleted ovaries of mice treated with  diepoxide.</a></h2><p>Ovarian cancer is associated with high mortality due to its late onset of symptoms and lack of reliable screening methods for early detection.

The present study was designed to induce ovarian neoplasia in this model by treating mice with 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA). Female B6C3F1 mice (age, 28 d) received intraperitoneal sesame oil (vehicle; VCD- groups) as a control or VCD (160 mg/kg; VCD+ groups) daily for 20 d to cause ovarian failure. Four months after the onset of dosing, mice from each group received a single injection of DMBA (VCD-DMBA+ and VCD+DMBA+ groups, n = 15 per group) or vehicle control (VCD-DMBA-, n = 15; VCD+ DMBA-, n = 14) under the bursa of the right ovary. Ovaries were collected 3 or 5 mo after injection and processed for histologic evaluation. Immunohistochemistry was used to confirm classification of neoplasms. None of the animals in the VCD-DMBA- and VCD-DMBA+ groups (that is, mice still undergoing estrus) had tumors at either time point. At the 3-mo time point, 12.5% of the VCD+DMBA+ mice had ovarian tumors; at 5 mo, 57.1% of the VCD+DMBA+ and 14.3% of VCD+DMBA- ovaries had neoplasms. Neoplasms stained positively for inhibin alpha (granulosa cells) and negatively for keratin 7 (surface epithelium), thus confirming classification of the lesions as Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors.

Extra-ovarian GSTM negatively regulates pro-apoptotic apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) through protein complex formation, which dissociates during stress, thereby initiating ASK1-induced apoptosis. The present study investigated the ovarian response of Gstm mRNA and protein to VCD. Induction of Ask1 mRNA at VCD-induced follicle loss onset was determined. Ovarian GSTM:ASK1 protein complex formation was investigated and VCD exposure effects thereon evaluated. Phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K) regulation of GSTM protein was also studied. Postnatal day (PND) 4 rat ovaries were cultured in control media ± 1) VCD (30 μM) for 2-8 days; 2) VCD (30 μM) for 2 days, followed by incubation in control media for 4 days (acute VCD exposure); or 3) LY294002 (20 μM) for 6 days. VCD exposure did not alter Gstm mRNA expression, however, GSTM protein increased (P<0.05) after 6 days of both the acute and chronic treatments. Ask1 mRNA increased (0.33-fold; P<0.05) relative to control after 6 days of VCD exposure. Ovarian GSTM:ASK1 protein complex formation was confirmed and, relative to control, the amount of GSTM bound to ASK1 increased 33% (P<0.05) by chronic but with no effect of acute VCD exposure. PI3K inhibition increased (P<0.05) GSTM protein by 40% and 71% on d4 and d6, respectively.

Detoxification of VCD can occur through glutathione conjugation, catalyzed by glutathione S-transferase (GST) enzymes. Further, GST class pi (GSTp) can negatively regulate JNK activity through protein:protein interactions in extra-ovarian tissues. Dissociation of this protein complex in the face of chemical exposure releases the inhibition of pro-apoptotic JNK. Increased JNK activity during VCD-induced ovotoxicity has been shown in isolated ovarian small pre-antral follicles following in vivo dosing of rats (80mg/kg/day; 15days, i.p.). The present study investigated the pattern of ovarian GSTp expression during VCD exposure. Additionally, the effect of VCD on an ovarian GSTp:JNK protein complex was investigated. PND4 F344 rat ovaries were incubated in control medium+/-VCD (30muM) for 2-8days. VCD increased ovarian GSTp mRNA (P <0.05) relative to control on d4-d8; whereas GSTp protein was increased (P<0.05) on d6-d8. A GSTp:JNK protein complex was detected by immunoprecipitation and Western blotting in ovarian tissues. Relative to control, the amount of GSTp-bound JNK was increased (P=0.09), while unbound JNK was decreased (P<0.05) on d6 of VCD exposure. The VCD-induced decrease in unbound JNK was preceded by a decrease in phosphorylated c-Jun which occurred on d4. These findings are in support of a possible dual protective role for GSTp in the rat ovary, consisting of  of VCD and inhibition of JNK-initiated apoptosis.2010 Elsevier Inc.

VCD can be detoxified to an inactive tetrol by microsomal epoxide hydrolase (mEH), or by conjugation to glutathione (GSH) by glutathione S-transferase (GST). Formation of VCD-GSH adducts in the mouse ovary 4 h after VCD exposure (0.57 mmol/kg/day) has been demonstrated. Because the mouse ovary expresses both mEH and GST, expression of mEH and GST pi and mu during a time-course of VCD-induced ovotoxicity was evaluated in a neonatal mouse ovarian culture system. Ovaries from postnatal day 4 (PND4) B6C3F(1) mice were incubated with VCD (15 microM) for 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, or 15 days. Following incubation, ovaries were histologically evaluated, or assessed for mRNA or protein expression. VCD did not cause follicle loss (p>0.05) on days 2, 4, or 6 of culture. At days 8, 10, 12, and 15, VCD reduced (p<0.05) both primordial and primary follicle numbers. Increased (p<0.05) expression of mEH, GST pi and GST mu mRNA was detected after 4 days of VCD exposure. This expression was reduced on days 6 and 8, when follicle loss was underway, but increased (p<0.05) after 10 days of exposure. mEH and GST pi proteins were elevated (p<0.05) following 8 days of VCD-exposure however there was no increase in GST mu protein.

Because ovotoxicity requires repeated dosing of VCH, the effect of consecutive daily doses of VCH (7.5 mmol/kg/day) on mouse liver microsomal activities and VCH epoxidation was determined. Cytochromes P-450 2B and 2A (CYP2B and CYP2A), principle isoforms involved in the bioactivation of VCH, as well as CYP2E1 and CYP3A were evaluated. VCH exposure increased total cytochrome P-450 content (35-83% above control levels) after either 5, 10, or 15 days of treatment. Western blot analysis revealed an induction of CYP2A, CYP2B, and CYP2E1 at day 10. Elevated levels of CYP2A and CYP2B correlated with marker androstenedione and testosterone 16alpha- and 16beta-hydroxylase activities. Microsomes prepared from mice pretreated with VCH for 10 days demonstrated an increase (>/=2-fold) in the rate of VCH monoepoxide and diepoxide formation. Microsomal VCH epoxidation was increased to a similar extent by phenobarbital, acetone, and dexamethasone treatment. An increase in cytosolic glutathione S-transferase activity was observed after repeated VCH treatment, an enzyme potentially involved in detoxification of the VCH epoxides. Interestingly, preliminary studies indicated that circulating levels of the monoepoxide (vinylcyclohexene 1, 2-monoepoxide) and diepoxide of VCH were elevated after repeated dosing of VCH. Overall, the results indicate that repeated exposure of VCH in mice induces cytochrome P-450-dependent activities, and in turn induction of its . Additional studies examining the toxicokinetics of VCH after repeated exposure are required to further delineate the relevance of induction in VCH-induced ovotoxicity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19236850>Neuroprotection against excitotoxic brain injury in mice after ovarian steroid depletion.</a></h2><p>Ovarian steroid hormones influence not only seizure phenomena, but also the neuronal cell death that follows. In the present study, we applied two models of ovarian steroid loss, ovariectomy and chemically-induced ovarian failure, to evaluate kainate-induced seizure activity and the susceptibility of hippocampal neurons to seizure-induced neurodegeneration. Young adult female FVB/NJ mice were ovariectomized with (OVX+E, n=6) or without (OVX, n=8) estrogen replacement. A separate group of females received the ovotoxin,  diepoxide (VCD, n=8) to deplete ovarian follicles. Mice underwent kainate-induced status epilepticus and were evaluated for seizure activity (3 h) and delayed hippocampal neuronal injury (7 days). While there were no differences in latency or duration of severe seizures among control, OVX and VCD-treated mice, OVX+E mice exhibited seizures of a significantly longer duration. However, both VCD-induced ovarian failure and OVX led to a dramatic reduction in the extent of excitotoxic cell death, with slightly greater effects observed in VCD-treated mice. Estradiol administration to OVX mice also exerted a significant neuroprotective effect against kainate-induced cell death. These results support and extend earlier findings suggesting that the hormonal milieu may have differential effects on seizure susceptibility that are separate and distinct from those influencing hippocampal neuronal vulnerability. Collectively, these findings highlight the complex interactions among the loss of ovarian steroid hormones, estrogen replacement, seizures, and seizure-induced cell death.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8919611>Follicular mechanisms associated with  diepoxide-induced ovotoxicity in rats.</a></h2><p>The mechanism of  diepoxide (VCD)-induced oocyte destruction in small preantral follicles of rats and mice has not been elucidated. This study examined the effects of daily dosing of female rats with VCD on protein synthesis and follicle viability. An investigation of granulosa cells as a target for VCD was also made. Small preantral follicles (25 to 100 microns) isolated from untreated immature rats (day 28) as well as from rats injected daily for 10 d with VCD (0.57 mmol/kg, IP) or vehicle control (sesame oil) were incubated for 3, 6, or 10 h in vitro with or without VCD. Viability (trypan blue dye exclusion) or protein synthesis (3H-leucine incorporation) in follicles was measured. Large preantral follicles (100 to 250 microns), isolated oocytes or granulosa cells from small preantral follicles, hepatocytes, and adrenal cells served as controls. Viability was not compromised in small follicles isolated from untreated or VCD-injected rats. However, following in vitro incubation of small preantral follicles with VCD, there was a significant decrease in viability by 6 h. This loss in viability was observed in granulosa cells and was even greater in follicles from dosed as compared with undosed animals. The various cell types were incubated in vitro with or without VCD for 3 h and the rate of protein synthesis was measured by 3H-leucine incorporation during the last hour of incubation. Incubation of small preantral follicles from untreated animals with VCD for 3 h produced significant inhibition in the rate of protein synthesis. This effect was reversed and significantly stimulated after 6 and 10 h of incubation with VCD. Follicles from animals that had been dosed daily with VCD for 10 d demonstrated similar inhibition of protein synthesis following 3 h in vitro incubation with VCD; however, unlike those from undosed rats, follicles from dosed rats did not recover from this inhibition after 6 or 10 h of in vitro incubation with VCD. In vitro incubation with VCD stimulated the rate of protein synthesis in large preantral follicles; however, no effect on the rate of protein synthesis was observed in isolated oocytes and granulosa cells, hepatocytes, or adrenal cells. These observations suggest that VCD affects follicular viability via an effect on granulosa cells and that daily dosing of rats with VCD makes small preantral follicles more susceptible to ovotoxicity by VCD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19439618>Loss of ovarian function in the VCD mouse-model of menopause leads to insulin resistance and a rapid progression into the  syndrome.</a></h2><p>Factors comprising the  syndrome occur with increased incidence in postmenopausal women. To investigate the effects of ovarian failure on the progression of the  syndrome, female B(6)C(3)F(1) mice were treated with  diepoxide (VCD) and fed a high-fat (HF) diet for 16 wk. VCD destroys preantral follicles, causing early ovarian failure and is a well-characterized model for the gradual onset of menopause. After 12 wk on a HF diet, VCD-treated mice had developed an impaired glucose tolerance, whereas cycling controls were unaffected [12 wk AUC HF mice 13,455 +/- 643 vs. HF/VCD 17,378 +/- 1140 mg/dl/min, P < 0.05]. After 16 wk on a HF diet, VCD-treated mice had significantly higher fasting insulin levels (HF 5.4 +/- 1.3 vs. HF/VCD 10.1 +/- 1.4 ng/ml, P < 0.05) and were significantly more insulin resistant (HOMA-IR) than cycling controls on a HF diet (HF 56.2 +/- 16.7 vs. HF/VCD 113.1 +/- 19.6 mg/dl x microU/ml, P < 0.05). All mice on a HF diet gained more weight than mice on a standard diet, and weight gain in HF/VCD mice was significantly increased compared with HF cycling controls. Interestingly, even without a HF diet, progression into VCD-induced menopause caused a significant increase in cholesterol and free fatty acids. Furthermore, in mice fed a standard diet (6% fat), insulin resistance developed 4 mo after VCD-induced ovarian failure. Insulin resistance following ovarian failure (menopause) was prevented by estrogen replacement. Studies here demonstrate that ovarian failure (menopause) accelerates progression into the  syndrome and that estrogen replacement prevents the onset of insulin resistance in VCD-treated mice. Thus, the VCD model of menopause provides a physiologically relevant means of studying how sex hormones influence the progression of the  syndrome.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24681254>Involvement of oxidative stress in -induced toxicity in Drosophila melanogaster.</a></h2><p> (VCH) is a dimer of 1,3-butadiene produced as a by-product of pesticides, plastic, rubber, flame retardants, and tire production. Although, several studies have reported the ovotoxicity of VCH, information on a possible involvement of oxidative stress in the toxicity of this occupational chemical is scarce. Hence, this study was carried out to investigate further possible mechanisms of toxicity of VCH with a specific emphasis on oxidative stress using a Drosophila melanogaster model. D. melanogaster (both genders) of 1 to 3 days old were exposed to different concentrations of VCH (10 µM-1 mM) in the diet for 5 days. Subsequently, the survival and negative geotaxis assays and the quantification of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation were determined. In addition, we evaluated RT-PCR expressions of selected oxidative stress and antioxidant mRNA genes (HSP27, 70, and 83, SOD, Nrf-2, MAPK2, and catalase). Furthermore, catalase, glutathione-S-transferase (GST), delta aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (δ-ALA-D), and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activities were determined. VCH exposure impaired negative geotaxic behavior and induced the mRNA of SOD, Nrf-2, and MAPK2 genes expressions. There were increases in catalase and ROS production, as well as inhibitions of GST, δ-ALA-D, and AChE activities (P<0.05). Our results suggest that the VCH mechanism of toxicity is associated with oxidative damage, as evidenced by the alteration in the oxidative stress-antioxidant balance, and possible neurotoxic consequences due to decreased AChE activity, and impairments in negative geotaxic behavior. Thus, we conclude that D. melanogaster is a useful model for investigating the toxicity of VCH exposure, and here, we have provided further insights on the mechanism of VCH-induced toxicity.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

In addition, VCM and VCD may be found as by-products of VCH oxidation in the environment. Recently, we reported the involvement of oxidative stress in the toxicity of VCH in Drosophila melanogaster. However, it was not possible to determine the individual contributions of VCM and VCD in VCH toxicity. Hence, we investigated the toxicity of VCM and VCD (10-1000 µM) in flies after 5 days of exposure via the diet. Our results indicated impairments in climbing behaviour and disruptions in antioxidant balance and redox status evidenced by an increase in DCFH oxidation, decreases in total thiol content and glutathione-S-transferase (GST) activity in the flies exposed to VCM and VCD (p<0.05). These effects were accompanied by disruptions in the transcription of the genes encoding the proteins superoxide dismutase (SOD1), kelch-like erythroid-derived cap-n-collar (CNC) homology (ECH)-associated protein 1 (Keap-1), mitogen activated protein kinase 2 (MAPK-2), catalase, Cyp18a1, JAFRAC 1 (thioredoxin peroxidase 1) and thioredoxin reductase 1 (TrxR-1) (p<0.05). VCM and VCD inhibited acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and delta aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (δ-ALA D) activities in the flies (p<0.05). Indeed, here, we demonstrated that different target enzymes and genes were modified by the electrophiles VCM and VCD in the flies. Thus, D. melanogaster has provided further lessons on the toxicity of VCM and VCD which suggest that the reported toxicity of VCH may be mediated by its transformation to VCM and VCD.Copyright © 2015 The Authors.

Since repeated exposure to VCH is necessary to cause ovotoxicity in mice, it is important to determine whether repeated exposure results in induction of cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes involved in its bioactivation. Hepatic microsomes prepared from mice or rats treated repeatedly with VCH demonstrated significantly increased VCH bioactivation in vitro, as assessed by VCH-1,2-epoxide, VCH-7,8-epoxide, or vinylcyclohexene diepoxide (VCD) formation. Mice and rats were then dosed with VCH, VCH-1,2-epoxide, or VCD for 10 days and measured for increases in hepatic microsomal CYP levels or activities. Total hepatic CYP levels were elevated only in microsomes from mice pretreated with VCH or VCH-1,2-epoxide. Immunoblotting analysis of microsomes from VCH-treated rodents revealed elevated levels of CYP2A and CYP2B in mice but not rats. VCH-1,2-epoxide pretreatment also increased CYP2B levels in the mouse. Activities toward specific substrates for CYP2A and CYP2B (coumarin and pentoxyresorufin, respectively) confirmed that VCH and VCH-1,2-epoxide pretreatments resulted in increased catalytic activities of CYP2A and CYP2B in the mouse but not the rat. Pretreatment with phenobarbital, a known inducer of CYP2A and CYP2B, increased VCH bioactivation in both species. Interestingly,  studies with human CYP "Supersomes" reveal that, of eight isoforms tested, only human CYP2E1 and CYP2B6 were capable of significantly catalyzing VCH epoxidation, whereas CYP2B6, CYP2A6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A4 were capable of catalyzing the epoxidation of the monoepoxides.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25705687>American ginseng regulates gene expression to protect against premature ovarian failure in rats.</a></h2><p>Premature ovarian failure (POF) is defined as lost ovarian functions before the age of 40. Three possible molecular markers (PLA2G4A, miR-29a, and miR-144) have been identified in our previous study by integrated analysis of mRNA and miRNA expression profiles. The present study aimed to evaluate American ginseng root's protective potential against POF by studying transcriptional and protein variations between American ginseng treatments and controls in rats.  diepoxide (VCD) was administered to rats for 14 days to induce POF. Additionally, American ginseng was administered to POF rats for one month, and PLA2G4A, miR-29a, and miR-144 expressions were measured in rat ovaries by qRT-PCR. PLA2G4A protein expression was examined by Western Blot, and PGE2, LH, FSH, and E2 serum levels were detected by ELISA. PLA2G4A mRNA and protein were downregulated in American ginseng-treated rats, miR-29a and miR-144 levels increased, and PGE2 serum levels decreased, while LH, FSH, and E2 increased compared to POF induction alone. Analysis of transcriptional and protein variations suggested that American ginseng protects the ovary against POF by regulating prostaglandin biosynthesis, ovulation, and preventing ovarian aging. High hormone levels (PGE2, FSH, and LH) were reduced, and E2 secretion approached normal levels, leading to improved POF symptoms and abnormal ovulation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7293224>A comparative study on the  of d-limonene and 4-vinylcyclohex-1-ene by hepatic microsomes.</a></h2><p></p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29396126>Use of the REVERT total protein stain as a loading control demonstrates significant benefits over the use of housekeeping proteins when analyzing brain homogenates by Western blot: An analysis of samples representing different gonadal hormone states.</a></h2><p>Western blot is routinely used to quantify differences in the levels of target proteins in tissues. Standard methods typically use measurements of housekeeping proteins to control for variations in loading and protein transfer. This is problematic, however, when housekeeping proteins also are affected by experimental conditions such as injury, disease, and/or gonadal hormone manipulations. Our goal was to evaluate an alternative and perhaps superior method for conducting Western blot analysis of brain tissue homogenates from rats with distinct physiologically relevant gonadal hormone states. Tissues were collected from the hippocampus, frontal cortex, and striatum of young adult female rats that either were ovariectomized to model surgical menopause, or were treated with the ovatotoxin  diepoxide (VCD) to model transitional menopause. Tissues also were collected from rats with a normal estrous cycle killed at proestrus when estradiol levels are high, and at diestrus when estradiol levels are low. Western blot detection of α-tubulin, β-actin, and GAPDH was performed and were compared for sensitivity and reliability with a fluorescent total protein stain (REVERT). Results show that the total protein stain was much less variable across samples and had a greater linear range than α-tubulin, β-actin, or GAPDH. The stain was stable and easy to use, and did not interfere with the immunodetection or multiplexed detection of the housekeeping proteins. In addition, we show that normalization of our data to total protein, but not to GAPDH, revealed significant differences in α-tubulin expression in the hippocampus as a function of treatment, and that gel-to-gel consistency in measuring differences between paired samples run on multiple gels was significantly better when data were normalized to total protein than when normalized to GAPDH. These results demonstrate that the REVERT total protein stain can be used in Western blot analysis of brain tissue homogenates to control for variations in loading and protein transfer, and provides significant advantages over the use of housekeeping proteins for quantifying changes in the levels of multiple target proteins.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, we used streptozotocin (STZ) to induce diabetes in the  diepoxide (VCD)-treated mouse model of menopause. DNA microarrays were used to identify gene expression changes in the diabetic kidney postmenopause. An ANOVA model, CARMA, was used to isolate the menopause effect between two groups of diabetic mice, diabetic menopausal (STZ/VCD) and diabetic cycling (STZ). In this diabetic study, 8,864 genes of the possible 15,600 genes on the array were included in the ANOVA; 99 genes were identified as demonstrating a >1.5-fold up- or downregulation between the STZ/VCD and STZ groups. We randomly selected genes for confirmation by real-time PCR; midkine (Mdk), immediate early response gene 3 (IEX-1), mitogen-inducible gene 6 (Mig6), and ubiquitin-specific protease 2 (USP2) were significantly increased in the kidneys of STZ/VCD compared with STZ mice. Western blot analysis confirmed that Mdk and IEX-1 protein abundance was significantly increased in the kidney cortex of STZ/VCD compared with STZ mice. In a separate study, DNA microarrays and CARMA analysis were used to identify the effect of menopause on the nondiabetic kidney; VCD-treated mice were compared with cycling mice. Of the possible 15,600 genes on the array, 9,142 genes were included in the ANOVA; 20 genes were identified as demonstrating a >1.5-fold up- or downregulation; histidine decarboxylase and vanin 1 were among the genes identified as differentially expressed in the postmenopausal nondiabetic kidney.

Microsomal preparations from liver, lung, and ovaries obtained from female Crl:CD BR rats and female B6C3F1 mice were tested for their ability to metabolize the following reactions: 4-VCH to 4-VCH-1,2-epoxide and 4-VCH-7,8-epoxide; 4-VCH-1,2-epoxide to 4-VCH diepoxide and 4-VCH-1,2-diol; 4-VCH-7,8-epoxide to 4-VCH diepoxide and 4-VCH-7,8-diol; and hydrolysis of 4-VCH diepoxide. Microsomes were incubated with the test chemical and the reaction products were analyzed by gas chromatography. Rat liver and lung microsomes and mouse liver and lung microsomes metabolized 4-VCH to 4-VCH-1,2-epoxide at detectable rates. Mouse liver had a Vmax for the reaction that was 56-fold higher than that for rat liver (11.1 and 0.20 nmol/min/mg protein, respectively). The Vmax for mouse lung was 2-fold higher than that for rat lung. 4-VCH-1,2-epoxide formation was not detected in ovarian microsomes from rats or mice.  of 4-VCH to 4-VCH-7,8-epoxide was detected in microsomes from rat liver and mouse liver and lung, at rates very low compared to those for  to the 1,2-epoxide. Rat and mouse liver had very similar K(m) and Vmax values for  of 4-VCH-1,2-epoxide to 4-VCH diepoxide. The Vmax for rat liver was 3.69 and for mouse liver was 5.35 nmol/min/mg protein. Rat and mouse ovaries did not have detectable capacity to metabolize 4-VCH-1,2-epoxide to the diepoxide. Rat and mouse liver and lung have very similar K(m) and Vmax values for  of 4-VCH-7,8-epoxide to the diepoxide, while ovaries did not have detectable rates for this reaction. Hydrolysis of 4-VCH-1,2-epoxide to 4-VCH-1,2-diol was at similar rates in rat and mouse liver microsomes. Hydrolysis of 4-VCH-7,8-epoxide to 4-VCH-7,8-diol was detected only in rat liver microsomes. Hydrolysis of 4-VCH diepoxide was detected in rat and mouse liver and lung, and in rat ovary microsomes. The Vmax for rat liver was 9-fold greater than that for mouse liver (5.51 and 0.63 nmol/min/mg protein, respectively), and lung and ovary tissues were not as active as rat liver. The balance of activation versus detoxication reactions in rats and mice suggests that the mouse may be more susceptible to 4-VCH toxicity because of generation of high levels of epoxide metabolites. In general, the mouse is more efficient at  of 4-VCH to epoxides than is the rat. In contrast, the rat may be more efficient at hydrolysis of epoxides. Thus, the rat would tend to produce a lower concentration of epoxide metabolites than the mouse, at equal doses of 4-VCH.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11420227>Apoptosis induced in rats by  diepoxide is associated with activation of the caspase cascades.</a></h2><p>Previous studies have shown that ovotoxicity induced in rats by dosing with  diepoxide (VCD) is likely via acceleration of the normal rate of atresia (apoptosis). The present study was designed to investigate the apoptosis-related caspase cascades as a component of this phenomenon in isolated ovarian small follicles. Female F344 rats were given a single dose of VCD (80 mg/kg, i.p., on Day 1; a time when ovotoxicity has not been initiated), or dosed daily for 15 days (80 mg/kg, i.p., on Day 15; a time when significant ovotoxicity is underway). Ovaries were collected after the final dose. Small preantral follicles (25-100 microm in diameter) were isolated, cellular fractions were prepared, and cleavage activity or protein expression levels of caspases-3, -8, and -9 were measured. Cytosolic caspase-3 activity was increased in small follicles (P < 0.01) by VCD treatment (Day 1, 2.86 +/- 0.23; Day 15, 3.25 +/- 0.64, VCD/control, n = 3). This activation was not seen in large or antral follicles (not targeted by VCD). Procaspase-3 protein was increased(P < 0.05) by VCD treatment 212% over controls in small ovarian follicles in Day 15, but not Day 1-dosed rats. Immunofluorescence staining intensity was evaluated by confocal microscopy. Caspase-3 protein, located in the cytosolic compartment of oocytes and granulosa cells of preantral follicles in various stages of development, was selectively increased (P < 0.05) in primordial and small primary follicles from Day 15 VCD-dosed rats. Caspase-8 activity was increased in small follicles in Day 15, but not in Day 1-treated rats; whereas caspase-9 activity was increased by VCD on Day 1 in the mitochondrial fraction. Thus, these data provide evidence that accelerated atresia induced in small ovarian follicles in rats by VCD is associated with activation of a caspase-mediated cascade.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19265289>Collaborative work on evaluation of ovarian toxicity. 4) Two- or four-week repeated dose study of  diepoxide in female rats.</a></h2><p>To determine the optimal administration period for evaluation of ovarian toxicity of  diepoxide (VCD), VCD was intraperitoneally administered to female Sprague-Dawley rats at 0 (Control), 5, 20 and 80 mg/kg once a day for 2 or 4 weeks (2- or 4-week study). To identify small follicles, serial sections of the ovaries were stained with routine hematoxylin and eosin (HE) and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) immunohistochemistry. In the 4-week study, decrease in small follicles was observed in the ovaries at 20 and 80 mg/kg. In the 2-week study, the same change was also observed at 80 mg/kg. Identification of small follicles using PCNA-stained slides was easier than that using HE-stained slides. In conclusion, histopathological findings in the ovaries are important for evaluation of female reproductive toxicity of VCD, and ovarian toxicity of VCD can be detected by administration for 2 weeks at an appropriate dose level. Furthermore, PCNA immunohistochemistry is effective for evaluation of small follicle destruction in chemical-induced ovarian toxicity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27647594>Evidence of oxidative damage and reproductive dysfunction accompanying  diepoxide exposure in female Wistar rats.</a></h2><p> diepoxide (VCD) is an occupational chemical widely reported to deplete ovarian follicles in rodents. Here, we investigated VCD-induced reproductive dysfunction in female Wistar rats. The rats were orally administered with VCD (100, 250 and 500mg/kg) for twenty-eight days. Thereafter, we evaluated selected biomarkers of oxidative damage, , endocrine disruption, and apoptosis. We observed that VCD increased ovarian and uterine malondialdehyde (MDA) level, and catalase, glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and glutathione S-transferase (GST) activities in rats (p<0.05). Also, VCD induced hormonal imbalance, increased ovarian superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, and depleted uterine SOD activity and ovarian glutathione (GSH) level in rats (p<0.05). Lastly, VCD markedly increase immunohistochemical expressions of ovarian cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), Caspase-9 and Caspase-3. Overall, VCD induced reproductive dysfunctions in rats via ovarian and uterine oxidative damage, hormonal imbalance, as well as  and apoptosis in the ovary of rats.Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Because of their nonrenewing nature, these "resting" oocytes are particularly vulnerable to xenobiotic insult, resulting in premature ovarian senescence and the formation of dysfunctional oocytes. In this study, we characterized the mechanisms of ovotoxicity for three ovotoxic agents,  diepoxide (VCD), methoxychlor (MXC), and menadione (MEN), all of which target immature follicles. Microarray analysis of neonatal mouse ovaries exposed to these xenobiotics in vitro revealed a more than twofold significant difference in transcript expression (p < 0.05) for a number of genes associated with apoptotic cell death and primordial follicle activation. Histomorphological and immunohistological analysis supported the microarray data, showing signs of primordial follicle activation and preantral follicle atresia both in vitro and in vivo. Sperm-oocyte fusion assays on oocytes obtained from adult Swiss mice treated neonatally revealed severely reduced sperm-egg binding and fusion in a dose-dependent manner for all the xenobiotic treatments. Additionally, lipid peroxidation analysis on xenobiotic-cultured oocytes indicated a dose-dependent increase in oocyte lipid peroxidation for all three xenobiotics in vitro. Our results reveal a novel mechanism of preantral ovotoxicity involving the homeostatic recruitment of primordial follicles to maintain the pool of developing follicles destroyed by xenobiotic exposure and to our knowledge provide the first documented evidence of short-term, low- and high-dose (VCD 40-80 mg/kg/day, MXC 50-100 mg/kg/day, MEN 7.5-15 mg/kg/day) neonatal exposure to xenobiotics causing long-term reactive oxygen species-induced oocyte dysfunction.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25801548>An assessment of anti-Müllerian hormone in predicting mating outcomes in female hamsters that have undergone natural and chemically-accelerated reproductive aging.</a></h2><p>In mammals, female fertility declines with age due in part to a progressive loss of ovarian follicles. The rate of follicle decline varies among individuals making it difficult to predict the age of onset of reproductive senescence. Serum anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) concentrations correlate with the numbers of ovarian follicles, and therefore, AMH could be a useful predictor of female fertility. In women and some production animals, AMH is used to identify which individuals will respond best to ovarian stimulation for assisted reproductive technologies. However, few studies have evaluated AMH's predictive value in unassisted reproduction, and they have yielded conflicting results. To assess the predictive value of AMH in the context of reproductive aging, we prospectively measured serum AMH in 9-month-old Siberian hamsters shortly before breeding them. Female Siberian hamsters experience substantial declines in fertility and fecundity by 9months of age. We also measured serum AMH in 5-month-old females treated with  diepoxide (VCD), which selectively destroys ovarian follicles and functionally accelerates ovarian aging. Vehicle-treated 5-month-old females served as controls. AMH concentrations were significantly reduced in VCD-treated females yet many females with low AMH reproduced successfully. On average, both young and old hamsters that littered had higher AMH concentrations than females that did not. However, some females with relatively high AMH concentrations failed to litter, whereas several with low AMH succeeded. Our results suggest that mean AMH concentration can predict mating outcomes on a population or group level, but on an individual basis, a single AMH determination is less informative.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

The ability of FSH and LH to modulate the disease has not been well studied owing to a lack of physiologically relevant models of ovarian cancer. In this study,  diepoxide (VCD) was used to deplete ovarian follicles and increase the levels of circulating FSH and LH in the tgCAG-LS-TAg mouse model of ovarian cancer.VCD-induced follicle depletion was performed either before or after induction of the oncogene SV40 large and small T-antigens in the ovarian surface epithelial cells of tgCAG-LS-TAg mice, which was mediated by the intrabursal delivery of an adenovirus expressing Cre recombinase (AdCre).tgCAG-LS-TAg mice injected with AdCre developed undifferentiated ovarian tumors with mixed epithelial and stromal components and some features of sex cord stromal tumors. Treatment with VCD before or after AdCre injection yielded tumors of similar histology, but with the unique appearance of Sertoli cell nests. In mice treated with VCD before the induction of tumorigenesis, the ovarian tumors tended to grow more slowly. The human ovarian cancer cell lines SKOV3 and OVCAR3 responded similarly to increased levels of gonadotropins in a second model of menopause, growing more slowly in ovariectomized mice compared with cycling controls.These results suggest that follicle depletion and increased gonadotropin levels can alter the histology and the rate of growth of ovarian tumors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27392628>Treatment of an industrial stream containing vinylcyclohexene by the H2O2/UV process.</a></h2><p>Petrochemical industries generate wastewaters containing pollutants that can severely impact the biological treatment systems. Some streams from specific production units may contain nonbiodegradable or toxic compounds that impair the performance of the wastewater treatment plant and should be segregated and treated by specific techniques. In this work, the utilization of chemical oxidation (H2O2/UV) was investigated for removing  (VCH) from a liquid stream coming from the production of hydroxylated liquid polybutadiene (HLPB). Besides VCH, this stream also contains ethanol, hydrogen peroxide, and many other organic compounds. Experiments were carried out in a small-scale photochemical reactor (0.7 L) using a 25-W low-pressure mercury vapor lamp. The photochemical reactor was operated in batch, and the reaction times were comprised between 10 and 60 min. Assays were also performed with a synthetic medium containing VCH, H2O2, and ethanol to investigate the removal of these substances in a less complex aqueous matrix. By-products formed in the reaction were identified by gas chromatography and mass spectroscopy (GC-MS). VCH was significantly removed by the oxidation process, in most assays to undetectable levels. Ethanol removal varied from 16 to 23 % depending on the reaction conditions. Acetic acid, acetaldehyde, and diols were detected as by-products of the industrial wastewater stream oxidation. A drop on the toxicity of the industrial stream was also observed in assays using the organism Artemia salina.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12408955>Characterization of a rat in vitro ovarian culture system to study the ovarian toxicant  diepoxide.</a></h2><p>Repeated daily dosing of rats with the occupational chemical  diepoxide (VCD) causes selective depletion of the smallest preantral ovarian follicles (primordial and primary). These targeted populations are difficult to study because they comprise very little of the overall mass of ovarian tissue. Additionally, they are randomly distributed throughout the ovary. Therefore, a neonatal rat ovarian culture system containing predominantly primordial and primary follicles was developed and its susceptibility to VCD was assessed. The in vivo sensitivity of neonatal rats to VCD dosing was first confirmed by daily injection of VCD (80 mg/kg/day ip) on postnatal days (PND) 4-19. On PND 19, depletion of primordial and small primary follicles was evident. Ovarian cultures were then established utilizing a floating organ culture system to treat ovaries from PND 4 Fischer 344 rats in vitro. Initial follicle populations in cultured ovaries consisted of primordial (81%) and small primary (19%) follicles, whereas larger-sized preantral follicles had developed after 15 days in culture (67% primordial, 31% small primary, and 2% large primary). Cultured rat ovaries were sensitive to follicle depletion by incubation with VCD (> or =30 microM), and follicle loss occurred in a time-dependent manner (8-15 days). Evidence for apoptosis in VCD-exposed ovaries, as demonstrated in vivo, was obtained using immunohistochemistry. There was significantly more staining for apoptosis-associated active caspase-3 and TUNEL in ovaries incubated with VCD (30 microM, 15 days) compared with matched controls. These results demonstrate that small preantral follicles of cultured neonatal rat ovaries are sensitive to VCD exposure. The similarities between VCD's effects in vitro and in vivo demonstrate the usefulness of this system for future mechanistic studies related to ovarian follicle loss induced by VCD or other ovotoxic chemicals.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8806858>Enhanced expression of bax in small preantral follicles during  diepoxide-induced ovotoxicity in the rat.</a></h2><p> diepoxide (VCD) destroys small preantral (25-100 microns) ovarian follicles after repeated dosing in mice and rats. A previous study determined this follicular destruction is via apoptosis (physiological cell death). The purposes of this study were to examine the effects of VCD on amounts of mRNA for several genes that might be involved in this ovotoxic response and to determine the specificity of this response for small preantral follicles. The genes of interest were bax, a cell death gene; three forms of the antioxidant enzyme, superoxide dismutase (mitochondrial manganese-containing or MnSOD, cytosolic copper/zinc-containing or Cu/ZnSOD, and secreted or secSOD); and microsomal epoxide hydrolase (mEH), involved in detoxification of VCD. Female Fischer 344 rats were administered daily doses (10 days) of vehicle control (sesame oil) or VCD (80 mg/kg, ip). Four hours after the last injection, livers and ovaries were removed. Small (25-100 microns) and large (100-250 microns) preantral follicles were separated from the ovaries by gentle dissociation and collected by mouth pipeting. Total RNA was extracted from all tissues, reverse transcribed into first-strand cDNA, and amplified by polymerase chain reaction using oligonucleotide primers specific for each gene. Relative levels of mRNA were visualized by agarose gel electrophoresis and autoradiography and quantified by densitometric analysis. Coamplification of ribosomal protein L19 (constitutively expressed in ovarian tissue) was used for normalization in each sample. Increased levels of mRNA for bax (172 +/- 20% of control, p < 0.05), MnSOD (248 +/- 70% of control, p < 0.05), and mEH (352 +/- 120% of control, p < 0.05) were measured in 25- to 100-microns follicles collected from VCD-treated compared with control rats. Unlike 25- to 100-microns follicles (the targets of ovotoxicity), in 100- to 250-microns follicles (nontargets) there were no changes (p > 0.05) in mRNA levels for bax or MnSOD in VCD-treated rats; however, mRNA levels for mEH were significantly decreased (79 +/- 4% of control, p < 0.05), compared with control. No changes in levels of mRNA for mEH were observed in liver from VCD-treated rats relative to control. Additionally, in liver VCD caused a significant decrease in mRNA levels for bax (31 +/- 5% of control, p < 0.05) and Cu-ZnSOD (56 +/- 17% of control, p < 0.05). In summary, dosing of rats with VCD enhanced expression of mRNA encoding several genes that might respond during the induction of ovotoxicity. The selective increase in bax in the population of follicles destroyed by repeated dosing with VCD may reflect their susceptibility to apoptosis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29969652>Depletion of follicles accelerated by combined exposure to phthalates and  diepoxide, leading to premature ovarian failure in rats.</a></h2><p>Humans are at daily risk by simultaneous exposures to a broad spectrum of man-made chemicals in the commercial products. Several classes of chemicals have been shown to alter follicle development and reduce fertility, leading to premature ovarian failure (POF) in mammals. We investigate the synergistic effects of  diepoxide (VCD) and phthalate, including di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), butyl benzyl phthalate (BBP) and di-n-butyl phthalate (DBP) on POF. Combination exposure with VCD and phthalate significantly reduced the numbers of primary follicles. The expressions of Amh and Sohlh2 were significantly decreased in the combination groups. Serum Amh levels were significantly lower in the combination groups. Additionally, serum levels of follicle-stimulating hormone were significantly increased in combination groups. Taken together, exposure to phthalates promotes the depletion of follicular follicles and consequently increases the risk of premature menopause, and combined exposure of phthalates and VCD to early menopausal women is likely to aggravate the POF syndrome.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

However, there is paucity of information on the precise biochemical and molecular mechanisms of VCD-induced male reproductive toxicity.This study investigated the influence of VCD on testicular and epidydimal functions following oral exposure of Wistar rats to VCD at 0, 100, 250 and 500 mg/kg for 28 consecutive days.Administration of VCD significantly decreased the body weight gain and organo-somatic indices of the testes and epididymis. When compared with the control, VCD significantly decreased superoxide dismutase and catalase activities in the testes whereas it significantly decreased superoxide dismutase activity but increased catalase activity in the epididymis. Moreover, while glutathione peroxidase activity and glutathione level remain unaffected, exposure of rats to VCD significantly increased glutathione S-transferase activity as well as hydrogen peroxide and malondialdehyde levels in testes and epididymis of the treated rats. The spermiogram of VCD-treated rats showed significant decrease in epididymal sperm count, sperm progressive motility, testicular sperm number and daily sperm production when compared with the control. Administration of VCD significantly decreased circulatory concentrations of follicle-stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone and testosterone along with testicular and epididymal degeneration in the treated rats. Immunohistochemical analysis showed significantly increased cyclooxygenase-2, inducible nitric oxide synthase, caspase-9 and caspase-3 protein expressions in the testes of VCD-treated rats.Exposure to VCD induces testicular and epidydimal dysfunctions via endocrine suppression, disruption of antioxidant enzymes activities, increase in biomarkers of oxidative stress,  and apoptosis in rats.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12193377>Activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases and AP-1 transcription factor in ovotoxicity induced by  diepoxide in rats.</a></h2><p>Previous studies have demonstrated that ovotoxicity induced in small preantral (primordial and primary) ovarian follicles by  diepoxide (VCD) in rats is likely via acceleration of the normal process of atresia (apoptosis). This acceleration is associated with increased activities of caspase cascades, changes in subcellular distribution of Bcl-2 family members, and alteration of estrogen receptor-mediated signaling . The present study was designed to investigate possible effects of VCD dosing on the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK)/AP-1 signaling  in rat ovarian small follicles. Female F344 rats were given a single dose of VCD (80 mg/kg i.p., 1 day--a time when ovotoxicity has not been initiated) or dosed daily for 10 or 15 days (80 mg/kg i.p.; 10 days--a time when the earliest signs of impending follicular destruction is seen, 15 days--a time when significant ovotoxicity is underway). Four hours following the final dose, ovaries and livers were collected. Ovarian small (25-100 microm) and large (100-250 microm) preantral follicles were isolated, and cytosolic or nuclear extracts were prepared from follicles and livers for analyses. Activities of MAPKs, including extracellular signal-regulated kinase, c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase (JNK), and p38 kinase, were determined in follicular and liver cytosolic extracts, and AP-1 DNA binding activity was determined in follicular and liver nuclear extracts. Compared with control, a single dose of VCD caused a decrease in JNK activity and an increase of AP-1 binding activity in isolated small ovarian follicles. After repeated daily dosing with VCD for 10 or 15 days, JNK and p38 kinase activities in small ovarian follicles were increased (p38 kinase: 1.64 +/- 0.14 for 10 days, 1.48 +/- 0.11 for 15 days, VCD/control, P < 0.01; JNK: 1.44 +/- 0.11 for 10 days, 1.37 +/- 0.06 for 15 days, VCD/control, P < 0.01) and AP-1 binding activity in small ovarian follicles was decreased (10 days, 0.29 +/- 0.04; 15 days, 0.51 +/- 0.04, VCD/control, P < 0.01). VCD did not affect any of these measurements in large preantral follicles or liver. Phosphorylation status of c-Jun protein as measured by Western blotting was increased (1.22 +/- 0.1, VCD/control, P < 0.05) after the 15-day daily dosing with VCD, but total c-Jun protein levels were unaffected. Using antibodies against c-Jun or phospho-c-Jun for supershift DNA binding assay, c-Jun and phospho-c-Jun were identified in the AP-1-DNA binding complex, and the binding activity was reduced in tissues with increased phospho-c-Jun protein levels. Taken together, these data provide evidence that accelerated atretic signals induced by VCD is associated with MAPK/AP-1 signaling  and phosphorylation of c-Jun plays a significant role in transmitting the apoptotic signals.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30965055>Ovarian failure induced by  diepoxide worsens the autonomic cardiovascular response to chronic unpredictable stress in rats.</a></h2><p>After menopause, women are more responsive to stress and more prone to exhibit hypertension, which elevates the risk of cardiac diseases. This vulnerability is due, in part, to the decline of ovarian steroids plasma levels. The 4-vinylciclohexane diepoxide (VCD) causes a gradual depletion of ovarian follicles causing loss of the normal ovarian function and a hormonal profile comparable to menopause in humans. We aimed to verify whether the ovarian failure (OF) worsens the cardiovascular autonomic response to stress.Rats were treated with VCD (160 mg/kg) or oil for 15 days, exposed to chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) for 10 days and studied 80 and 180 days after VCD treatment.80 days after VCD-treatment, stressed rats showed increased sympathetic nerve activity, reduced parasympathetic activity and an increase in the overall spontaneous baroreflex sensitivity (BRS). 180 days after VCD treatment, BRS was impaired and the vascular sympathetic activity was increased, independently of stress exposure.Neither 80 nor 180 days after the onset of VCD-treatment the hypertensive effects of stress were enhanced in rats. However, OF led to a worsening on different aspects of the cardiovascular response to stress, which can cause cardiovascular complications when associated with ovarian aging.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The decrease in ovarian follicles during perimenopause contributes to a dynamic and complex hormonal milieu that is not yet well characterized. In rodents,  diepoxide (VCD) induces a gradual depletion of ovarian follicles, modeling the transition to menopause in women. This study was aimed to investigate, in VCD-treated rats, the hormonal status and the behavior in the elevated plus-maze (EPM), a widely used test to assess anxiety-like behavior. From the postnatal day 28, rats were treated with VCD or vehicle for 15 days. At 80±5 days after the beginning of treatment the experiments were performed at proestrus and diestrus. In the first experiment rats were decapitated, ovary was collected and blood samples were taken for estradiol, progesterone, follicle stimulant hormone (FSH), testosterone, dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and corticosterone measurements. In the second experiment, rats were subjected to the EPM for 5 min, and behavioral categories recorded. Administration of VCD induced follicular depletion as well as an increase of the number of atretic follicles demonstrating the treatment efficacy. The transitional follicular depletion was accompanied by lower progesterone, testosterone and DHT with no changes in the FSH, estradiol and corticosterone plasma levels. On the EPM, rats showed decreased open arm exploration and increased risk assessment behavior, indicating increased anxiety. These findings show that administration of VCD to induce ovarian failure results in endocrine and anxiety-related changes that are similar to the symptoms exhibited by women during menopause transition. Thus, this model seems to be promising in the study of perimenopause-related changes.Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

VCD specifically destroys small preantral (primordial and small primary) follicles in the rodent ovary. The phase I enzyme, cytochrome P450 isoform 2E1 (CYP2E1) is involved in ovarian  of VCM to VCD. Further, microsomal epoxide hydrolase (mEH) can detoxify VCD to an inactive tetrol (4-(1,2-dihydroxy)ethyl-1,2-dihydroxycyclohexane). This study evaluated the effects of VCD-induced ovotoxicity on mEH in CYP2E1+/+ and -/- mice (129S(1)/SvImJ background strain) using a postnatal day 4 mouse whole ovary culture system. The hypothesis of our study is that there is a relationship between CYP2E1 and mEH gene expression in the mouse ovary. Relative to control, VCD exposure caused follicle loss (p < 0.05) in ovaries from both genotypes; however, after 15 days, this loss was greater (p < 0.05) in CYP2E1+/+ ovaries. In a time course (2-15 days), relative to control, VCD (5 microM) caused an increase (p < 0.05) in mEH mRNA by 0.5-fold (day 10) and 1.84-fold (day 15) in CYP2E1-/- but not +/+ ovaries. 7,12-Dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA) also destroys ovarian follicles but, unlike VCD, is bioactivated by mEH to an ovotoxic 3,4-diol-1,2-epoxide metabolite. Incubation of ovaries in increasing concentrations of DMBA (0.5-1 microM, 15 days) resulted in greater (p < 0.05) follicle loss in CYP2E1-/-, relative to +/+ ovaries. With greater mEH (CYP2E1-/-), increased follicle loss with DMBA (bioactivation) and decreased follicle loss with VCD (detoxification) support that ovarian expression of CYP2E1 and mEH may be linked.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25564616>Rictor/mTORC2 pathway in oocytes regulates folliculogenesis, and its inactivation causes premature ovarian failure.</a></h2><p>Molecular basis of ovarian folliculogenesis and etiopathogenesis of premature ovarian failure (POF), a common cause of infertility in women, are not fully understood. Mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 2 (mTORC2) is emerging as a central regulator of cell , proliferation, and survival. However, its role in folliculogenesis and POF has not been reported. Here, we showed that the signaling activity of mTORC2 is inhibited in a  diepoxide (VCD)-induced POF mouse model. Notably, mice with oocyte-specific ablation of Rictor, a key component of mTORC2, demonstrated POF phenotypes, including massive follicular death, excessive loss of functional ovarian follicles, abnormal gonadal hormone secretion, and consequently, secondary subfertility in conditional knock-out (cKO) mice. Furthermore, reduced levels of Ser-473-phosphorylated Akt and Ser-253-phosphorylated Foxo3a and elevated pro-apoptotic proteins, Bad, Bax, and cleaved poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP), were observed in cKO mice, replicating the signaling alterations in 4-VCD-treated ovaries. These results indicate a critical role of the Rictor/mTORC2/Akt/Foxo3a pro-survival signaling axis in folliculogenesis. Interestingly, loss of maternal Rictor did not cause obvious developmental defects in embryos or placentas from cKO mice, suggesting that maternal Rictor is dispensable for preimplantation embryonic development. Our results collectively indicate key roles of Rictor/mTORC2 in folliculogenesis, follicle survival, and female fertility and support the utility of oocyte-specific Rictor knock-out mice as a novel model for POF.© 2015 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21621605> diepoxide (VCD) inhibits mammary epithelial differentiation and induces fibroadenoma formation in female Sprague Dawley rats.</a></h2><p> diepoxide (VCD), an occupational chemical that targets ovarian follicles and accelerates ovarian failure in rodents, was used to test the effect of early-onset reproductive senescence on mammary fibroadenoma formation. One-month female Sprague Dawley rats were dosed with VCD (80 mg/kg or 160 mg/kg) and monitored for 22 months for persistent estrus and tumor development. Only high-dose VCD treatment accelerated the onset of persistent estrus relative to controls. However, both doses of VCD accelerated mammary tumor onset by 5 months, increasing incidence to 84% (vs. 38% in controls). Tumor development was independent of time in persistent estrus, 17 β-estradiol, androstenedione and prolactin. Delay in VCD administration until after completion of mammary epithelial differentiation (3 months) did not alter tumor formation despite acceleration of ovarian senescence. VCD administration to 1-month rats acutely decreased mammary alveolar bud number and expression of β-casein, suggesting that VCD's tumorigenic effect requires exposure during mammary epithelial differentiation.Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Previous studies suggested that VCH is bioactivated via cytochromes P450 (CYP450) to the ovotoxic, diepoxide metabolite, VCD. Whereas hepatic CYP450 isoforms 2E1, 2A, and 2B can metabolize VCH, the role of ovarian  is unknown. This study investigated expression of these isoforms in isolated ovarian fractions (F1, 25-100 microm; F2, 100-250 microm; F3, >250 microm; interstitial cells, Int) from B6C3F1 mice dosed daily (15 days; ip) with vehicle, VCH (7.4 mmol/kg/day) or VCD (0.57 mmol/kg/day). Ovaries were removed and either isolated into specific ovarian compartments for mRNA analysis, fixed for immunohistochemistry, or prepared for enzymatic assays. mRNA and protein for all isoforms were expressed/distributed in all ovarian fractions from vehicle-treated mice. In the targeted F1 follicles, VCH or VCD dosing increased (p < 0.05) mRNA encoding CYP2E1 (645 +/- 14% VCH; 582 +/- 16% VCD), CYP2A (689 +/- 8% VCH; 730 +/- 22% VCD), and CYP2B (246 +/- 7% VCH) above control. VCH dosing altered (p < 0.05) mRNA encoding CYP2E1 in nontargeted F3 follicles (168 +/- 7%) and CYP2A in Int (207 +/- 19%) above control. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed the greatest staining intensity for all CYP isoforms in the Int. VCH dosing altered (p < 0.05) staining intensity in Int for CYP2E1 (19 +/- 2.4% below control) and CYP2A (39 +/- 5% above control). Staining intensity for CYP2B was increased (p < 0.05) above control in granulosa cells of small preantral (187 +/- 42%) and antral (63 +/- 8%) follicles. Catalytic assays in ovarian homogenates revealed that CYP2E1 and CYP2B were functional. Only CYP2E1 activity was increased (149 +/- 12% above control; p < 0.05) by VCH dosing. The results demonstrate that mRNA and protein for CYP isoforms known to bioactivate VCH are expressed in the mouse ovary and are modulated by in vivo exposure to VCH and VCD. Interestingly, there is high expression of these isoforms in the Int. Thus, the ovary may contribute to ovotoxicity by promoting bioactivation of VCH to the toxic metabolite, VCD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28865222>Evaluation of intra-testicular injections of calcium chloride and  1,2 monoepoxide for chemical sterilization in guinea pigs.</a></h2><p>This study was aimed at investigating the use of intra-testicular calcium chloride (CaCl2) and  1,2-monoepoxide (VCM) injections as a side effect-free alternative method for the control of reproduction in guinea pigs.
