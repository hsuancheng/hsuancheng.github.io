There was assessment, therefore, of the capacity of individual fatty acids bound to fatty  free BSA to improve sperm survival at 6 °C because oxidative stress and lipid degradation are prominent detrimental factors. Different effects of the fatty acids were observed. Supplementation with naturally occurring fatty acids (, linoleic, oleic, palmitoleic ), which may become metabolically incorporated into sperm lipids, increased the number of motile and progressively motile sperm after 2 days of storage during a thermo-resistance test (5 h at 38 °C) to that of control samples preserved at 17 °C in pure Beltsville Thawing Solution. With the exception of , all naturally occurring fatty acids enhanced the number of sperm with active  after 3 days of storage. Palmitoleic  was the most effective supplement with effects already present when sperm were re-warmed for 30 min after 2 and 7 days of storage. The non-endogenous, non-integrated timnodonic  (20:5) had no effect on sperm variables. Because the application of individual fatty acids attached to BSA had differing effects in preserving boar sperm at 6 °C, the use of combinations of fatty acids could be more efficacious than with use of natural lipid supplements for low temperature preservation of sperm.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we studied the lipid composition of thylakoid membranes and chloroplast ultrastructure in isoprene-emitting (IE) and nonisoprene-emitting (NE) poplar (Populus × canescens). We demonstrated that the total amount of monogalactosyldiacylglycerols, digalactosyldiacylglycerols, phospholipids, and fatty acids is reduced in chloroplasts when isoprene biosynthesis is blocked. A significantly lower amount of unsaturated fatty acids, particularly  in NE chloroplasts, was associated with the reduced fluidity of thylakoid membranes, which in turn negatively affects photosystem II photochemical efficiency. The low photosystem II photochemical efficiency in NE plants was negatively correlated with nonphotochemical quenching and the energy-dependent component of nonphotochemical quenching. Transmission electron microscopy revealed alterations in the chloroplast ultrastructure in NE compared with IE plants. NE chloroplasts were more rounded and contained fewer grana stacks and longer stroma thylakoids, more plastoglobules, and larger associative zones between chloroplasts and . These results strongly support the idea that in IE species, the function of this molecule is closely associated with the structural organization and functioning of plastidic membranes.© 2015 American Society of Plant Biologists.

The efficacy of ALA was scrutinized in vivo and in vitro using various experiments like hemodynamic studies, morphological analysis, antioxidants parameters, immunoblotting, and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. The effect of ALA was also validated using C. elegans worms. ALA administration had a positive effect on tissue architecture of the malignancy when scrutinized through the whole mount carmine staining, hematoxylin and eosin staining, and scanning electron microscopy. The proteomic and genomic checkpoint revealed the participation of mitochondrial dysfunction, alteration of hypoxic microenvironment, and involvement of cholinergic anti-inflammatory response after treatment with ALA. ALA treatment has also increased the level of synaptic acetylcholine and acetylcholine esterase with a significant decrease in lipid content. It was concluded that ALA persuaded the mitochondrial stress, activation of downstream cholinergic anti-inflammatory markers, and favorable regulation of hypoxia microenvironment through inhibition of fatty  synthase and sterol regulatory element-binding protein.© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26528354>Polyunsaturated fatty acids trigger apoptosis of colon cancer cells through a mitochondrial pathway.</a></h2><p>Colorectal cancer is common in developed countries. Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) have been reported to possess tumoricidal action, but the exact mechanism of their action is not clear.In the present study, we studied the effect of various n-6 and n-3 fatty acids on the survival of the colon cancer cells LoVo and RKO and evaluated the possible involvement of a mitochondrial pathway in their ability to induce apoptosis.It was observed that n-3 α-, eicosapentaenoic  and docosahexaenoic  (ALA, EPA and DHA respectively) and n-6 linoleic , gamma- and arachidonic  (LA, GLA and AA respectively) induced apoptosis of the colon cancer cells LoVo and RKO at concentrations above 120 μM (p < 0.01 compared to control). The semi-differentiated colon cancer cell line RKO was more sensitive to the cytotoxic action of PUFAs compared to the undifferentiated colon cancer cell line LoVo. PUFA-treated cells showed an increased number of lipid droplets in their cytoplasm. PUFA-induced apoptosis of LoVo and RKO cells is mediated through a -mediated pathway as evidenced by loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, generation of ROS, accumulation of intracellular Ca(2+), activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3, decreased ATP level and increase in the Bax/Bcl2 expression ratio.PUFAs induced apoptosis of colon cancer cells through a mitochondrial dependent pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30410924>Linezolid Inhibited Synthesis of ATP in : Based on GC-MS Metabolomics and HPLC Method.</a></h2><p>Linezolid has been widely used in serious infections for its effective inhibiting effect against multidrug-resistant gram-positive pathogens. However, linezolid caused severe adverse reactions, such as thrombocytopenia, anaemia, optic neuropathy, and near-fatal serotonin syndrome. In order to investigate the toxicity of linezolid, twenty-four Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into: control group (n=7), low-group (n=8), and high-group (n=9). The rats of low-group and high-group were given by gavage with linezolid 60 and 120 mg/kg/day for 7 days, respectively. The serum concentration of linezolid was determined by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC); blood metabolic change was analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometer (GC-MS). Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) concentration in HepG2-C3A after being cultured with linezolid was determined by HPLC. The results showed that there were six metabolites and nine metabolites had statistical differences in low-group and high-group (P<0.05). The trimethyl phosphate was the most significant indicator in those changed metabolites. Except for d-glucose which was slightly increased in low-group, octadecanoic , cholest-5-ene, hexadecanoic , -, eicosapentaenoic , 9,12-Octadecadienoic , and docosahexaenoic  were all decreased in low-group and high-group. ATP concentration was decreased in HepG2-C3A after cultured with linezolid. In conclusion, the toxicity of linezolid is related to its serum concentration.

This study examined the effects of omega-3  (ALA) during in vitro oocyte maturation (IVM) in the presence of PSO on subsequent embryo development and quality, and the cellular mechanisms that might be involved. Bovine cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) were supplemented during IVM with ALA (50 μM), PSO (425 μM), or PSO+ALA. Compared with FFA-free controls (P < 0.05), PSO increased embryo fragmentation and decreased good quality embryos on day 2 postfertilization. Day 7 blastocyst rate was also reduced. Day 8 blastocysts had lower cell counts and higher apoptosis but normal metabolic profile. In the PSO group, cumulus cell (CC) expansion was inhibited with an increased CC apoptosis while COC metabolism was not affected. Mitochondrial inner membrane potential (MMP; JC-1 staining) was reduced in the CCs and oocytes. Heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) but not glucose-regulated protein 78 kDa (GRP78, known as BiP; an endoplasmic reticulum stress marker) was upregulated in the CCs. Higher reactive oxygen species levels (DCHFDA staining) were detected in the oocytes. In contrast, adding ALA in the presence of PSO normalized embryo fragmentation, cleavage, blastocyst rates, and blastocyst quality compared to controls (P > 0.05). Combined treatment with ALA also reduced CC apoptosis, partially recovered CC expansion, abrogated the reduction in MMP in the CCs but not in the oocytes, and reduced BiP and HSP70 expression in CCs, compared with PSO only (P < 0.05). In conclusion, ALA supplementation protected oocyte developmental capacity under lipotoxic conditions mainly by protecting cumulus cell viability.© The Authors 2017.

Through in vitro plant cell culture it is possible to modify CB lipid profiles and to study the fatty  biosynthesis pathway on a subcellular level, evaluating fundamental aspects to enhance in vitro fatty  production in a specific and controlled way. In this research, culture media was supplemented with acetate, biotin, pyruvate, bicarbonate and glycerol at three different concentrations and the effects on the biomass production (g/L), cell viability, and fatty acids profile and production was evaluated in in vitro cell suspensions culture. It was found that biotin stimulated fatty  synthesis without altering cell viability and cell growth. It was also evident a change in the lipid profile of cell suspensions, increasing middle and long chain fatty acids proportion, which are unusual to those reported in seeds; thus implying that it is possible to modify lipid profiles according to the treatment used. According to the results of sucrose gradients and enzyme assays performed, it is proposed that cacao cells probably use the pentose phosphate pathway,  being the key organelle in the carbon flux for the synthesis of reductant power and fatty  precursors.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Pyrosequencing was used to determine the effects of dietary lipid sources (FAs) on mtDNA methylation.Mitochondrial arginine transfer RNA and NAD(H) dehydrogenase 4L encoding region methylation in the liver was higher in the OO (9.5% ± 0.52%; P < 0.05) and PO (7.3% ± 0.33%; P < 0.05) groups than in the FO (5.9% ± 0.42%) group, whereas 12S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) methylation in the liver was lower in the OO group (2.7% ± 0.22%) than in the FO group (4.2% ± 0.73%) (P < 0.05). Additionally, fish fed the OO diet had lower liver mRNA levels of ND3 (P < 0.05), ND4L (P < 0.05), ND6 (P < 0.05), 12S rRNA (P < 0.05), and 16S rRNA (P < 0.05) than those fed the FO diet, whereas fish fed the PO diet had lower liver mRNA levels of 16S rRNA than those fed the FO diet (P < 0.05). Moreover, fish fed the OO (P < 0.05) or PO (P < 0.05) diet had lower liver mitochondrial complex I activity than did those fed the FO diet.These findings provide the first evidence, to our knowledge, that dietary lipid sources influence mitochondrial function through mtDNA methylation in large yellow croakers.© 2015 American Society for Nutrition.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27179363>Molecular species composition of plant cardiolipin determined by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry.</a></h2><p>Cardiolipin (CL), an anionic phospholipid of the inner mitochondrial membrane, provides essential functions for stabilizing respiratory complexes and is involved in mitochondrial morphogenesis and programmed cell death in animals. The role of CL and its metabolism in plants are less well understood. The measurement of CL in plants, including its molecular species composition, is hampered by the fact that CL is of extremely low abundance, and that plants contain large amounts of interfering compounds including galactolipids, neutral lipids, and pigments. We used solid phase extraction by anion exchange chromatography to purify CL from crude plant lipid extracts. LC/MS was used to determine the content and molecular species composition of CL. Thus, up to 23 different molecular species of CL were detected in different plant species, including Arabidopsis, mung bean, spinach, barley, and tobacco. Similar to animals, plant CL is dominated by highly unsaturated species, mostly containing linoleic and . During phosphate deprivation or exposure to an extended dark period, the amount of CL decreased in Arabidopsis, accompanied with an increased degree in unsaturation. The mechanism of CL remodeling during stress, and the function of highly unsaturated CL molecular species, remains to be defined.Copyright © 2016 by the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28524760>Evaluation of the cytotoxicity (HepG2) and chemical composition of polar extracts from the ruderal species Coleostephus myconis (L.)

Owing to its advantageous agronomic properties, C. myconis might have industrial applications. However, this species needs to be comprehensively characterized before any potential use. In a previous study, the phenolic composition and antioxidant activity of different C. myconis tissues were characterized. This investigation was extended to examine the cytotoxic potential of selected plant tissues (flowers and green parts) using a HepG2 cell line by utilizing the lysosomal neutral red uptake assay or mitochondrial (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazolyl-2)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. In addition, the macronutrients content, lipophilic compounds (fatty acids, tocopherols), and amino acids were also determined. C. myconis flowers were used in the senescence stage, which was previously identified as the stage that presented maximal phenolic content and highest antioxidant activity. In contrast, stems and leaves were employed due to their high biomass proportion. Regarding cytotoxicity, mitochondrial and lysosomal damage was only significant when HepG2 cells were exposed to the highest extract concentrations (stems and leaves, 0.9 mg/ml; senescent flowers, 0.3 mg/ml). Chemically, the senescent flowers were mostly characterized by their high levels of fat, amino acids (especially threonine), oleic , β-, and γ-tocopherol, while stems and leaves contained high concentrations of carbohydrates, , and α-tocopherol. In general, these results provide information regarding the threshold concentrations of C. myconis extracts that might be used in different applications without toxicity hazards.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31207257> based nano-suspension protect against lipopolysaccharides induced mastitis by inhibiting NFκBp65, HIF-1α, and -mediated apoptotic pathway in albino Wistar rats.</a></h2><p>The purpose of this study was to investigate the therapeutic effects and underlying mechanism of  based intra-mammary nano-suspension (ALA-NS) on both in vitro antimicrobial and in vivo activity. The ALA-NS formulated and optimized for parameters like particle size, zeta potential, polydispersity index, sedimentation volume, and stability studies. In vitro, our results showed that ALA-NS (F1 and F2) have the higher zone of inhibition and lower minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) value than ALA and cefotaxime alone against mastitis-causing pathogens. In vivo, our results showed that ALA-NS (F1 and F2) restored the altered oxidative biomarkers (superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione, TBARs, and protein carbonyl) along with histopathological changes in lipopolysaccharides (LPS) treated rats. Western blot results indicated that ALA-NS (F1 and F2) inhibited LPS induced inflammatory proteins (NFκBp65, COX, LOX, and IFN-γ) in rat mammary epithelial cells. ALA-NS (F1 and F2) also suppressed the hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) and upregulated prolyl-hydroxylase (PHD-2), sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP-1c), and fatty  synthase (FASN) protein expression. In addition, ALA-NS upregulated the pro-apoptotic (BAX and BAD) and downregulated anti-apoptotic (BCL-2 and BCL-XL) proteins expression in rat mammary epithelial tissue. In conclusion, we found that ALA-NS (F1 and F2) have in vitro antimicrobial activity and protective effects on LPS-induced mastitis in rats.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Nutritional interventions such as adjuvant strategy for preventing these conditions are recently gaining increasing attention. Ingestion of n3-polyunsaturated fatty acids has been suggested as having a positive impact on muscle diseases. We recently demonstrated that a diet enriched with plant derived n3-fatty , α- (ALA), exerts potent beneficial effects in preserving skeletal muscle regeneration in models of muscle dystrophy. To better elucidate the underlying mechanism we here investigate on the expression level of the anti- and pro-apoptotic proteins, as well as caspase-3 activity, in C2C12 myoblasts challenged with pathological levels of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF). The results demonstrated that ALA protective effect on C2C12 myoblasts was associated with a decrease in caspase-3 activity and an increase of the Bcl-2/Bax ratio. Indeed, the effect of ALA was directed to rescuing Bcl-2 expression and to revert Bax translocation to  both affected in an opposite way by TNF, a major pro-inflammatory cytokine expressed in damaged skeletal muscle. Therefore, ALA counteracts inflammatory signals in the muscle microenvironment and may represent a valuable strategy for ameliorating skeletal muscle pathologies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28846858>Effects of dietary-induced alterations in rat brain docosahexaenoic  accrual on phospholipid metabolism and mitochondrial bioenergetics: An in vivoP MRS study.</a></h2><p>Evidence from P magnetic resonance spectroscopy (P MRS) studies suggest that different psychiatric disorders, which typically emerge during adolescence and young adulthood, are associated with abnormalities in mitochondrial bioenergetics and membrane phospholipid metabolism. These disorders are also associated with deficits in omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA), including docosahexaenoic  (DHA) which accumulates in mitochondrial and synaptic membranes. The present study investigated the effects of dietary-induced alterations in brain DHA accrual during adolescence on phospholipid metabolism and bioenergetics in the adult rat brain using P MRS. During the peri-adolescent period (P21-P90), male rats were fed a diet with no n-3 fatty acids (Deficient, DEF, n = 20), a diet fortified with preformed DHA (fish oil, FO, n = 20), or a control diet fortified with  (18:3n-3, n = 20). On P90, P MRS was performed under isoflurane anesthetic using a 7 T Bruker Biospec system. Compared with controls, brain DHA levels were significantly lower in adult rats fed the DEF diet (-17%, p ≤ 0.0001) and significantly higher in rats fed the FO diet (+14%, p ≤ 0.0001). There were no significant group differences for indices of bioenergetics, including adenosine triphosphate and phosphocreatine levels, or indices of membrane phospholipid metabolism including phosphomonoesters and phosphodiesters. Therefore, the present P MRS data suggest that rat brain DHA levels are not a significant predictor of mitochondrial bioenergetics or membrane phospholipid metabolism.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Therefore, we investigated the independent and combined effects of α- (ALA) supplementation and exercise training on whole-body glucose homeostasis and mitochondrial bioenergetics within the WAT and skeletal muscle of obese Zucker rats.We randomly assigned obese Zucker rats to receive a control diet alone or supplemented with ALA and to remain sedentary or undergo exercise training for 4 weeks (CON-Sed, ALA-Sed, CON-Ex and ALA-Ex groups). Whole-body glucose tolerance was determined in response to a glucose load. Mitochondrial content and bioenergetics were examined in skeletal muscle and epididymal WAT (eWAT). Insulin sensitivity and cellular stress were assessed by western blot.Exercise training independently improved whole-body glucose tolerance as well as insulin-induced signalling in muscle and WAT. However, the consumption of ALA during exercise training prevented exercise-mediated improvements in whole-body glucose tolerance. ALA consumption did not influence exercise-induced adaptations within skeletal muscle, insulin sensitivity and mitochondrial bioenergetics. In contrast, within eWAT, ALA supplementation attenuated insulin signalling, decreased mitochondrial respiration and increased the fraction of electron leak to reactive oxygen species (ROS).These findings indicate that, in an obese rodent model, consumption of ALA attenuates the favourable adaptive changes of exercise training within eWAT, which consequently impacts whole-body glucose homeostasis.

Plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) plays an important role in the development hepatic fibrosis. The overexpression of PAI-1 induces ECM accumulation, the main hallmark of chronic liver diseases. Death of hepatocytes is a characteristic feature of chronic liver disease due to various causes. The TGF-β1-mediated apoptotic pathway is regarded as a promising therapeutic target in hepatic fibrosis. Gamma- (GLA) is of special interest as it possesses anti-fibrosis, anti-inflammatory, and anti-cancer properties. However, the precise mechanism for GLA in chronic liver disease is not still clear. The aim of the present study was to determine whether GLA prevents hepatic PAI-1 expression and apoptosis through the inhibition of TGF-β1-mediated molecular mediators. GLA attenuated TGF-β1-stimulated PAI-1 expression, and inhibited PAI-1 promoter activity in AML12 cells. This effect was mediated by Smad3/4, the p38 pathways. We also found that GLA suppressed TGF-β1-induced apoptotic activation of the Bcl-2 family and caspase family of proteins, which resulted in the inhibition of poly-ADP-ribose polymerase 1 cleavage.

The change in CL species may alter the mitochondrial membrane composition, potentially disturbing the mitochondrial structure and function during inflammation.To investigate the effect of the unsaturation of fatty acids on CL, we supplemented macrophage-like RAW264.7 cells with 18-carbon unsaturated fatty acids including oleic  (OA, 18:1), linoleic  (LA, 18:2), α- (ALA, 18:3), γ- (GLA, 18:3), and stearidonic  (SDA, 18:4). Mitochondrial changes in CL were measured through mass spectrometry.Our data indicated that OA(18:1) was the most efficient fatty  that incorporated into CL, forming symmetrical CL without fatty  elongation and desaturation. In addition, LA(18:2) and ALA(18:3) were further elongated before incorporation, significantly increasing the number of double bonds and the chain length of CL. GLA and SDA were not optimal substrates for remodeling enzymes. The findings of RT-qPCR experiments revealed that none of these changes in CL occurred through the regulation of CL remodeling- or synthesis-related genes. The fatty  desaturase and transportation genes-Fads2 and Cpt1a, respectively-were differentially regulated by the supplementation of five unsaturated 18-carbon fatty acids.The process of fatty  incorporation to CL was regulated by the fatty  desaturation and transportation into  in macrophage. The double bonds of fatty acids significantly affect the incorporation process and preference. Intact OA(18:1) was incorporated to CL; LA(18:2) and ALA(18:3) were desaturated and elongated to long chain fatty  before the incorporation; GLA(18:3) and SDA(18:4) were unfavorable for the CL incorporation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28679464>Linoleic (LA) and  (ALA)  concentrations in follicular fluid of prepubertal goats and their effect on oocyte in vitro maturation and embryo development.</a></h2><p>In this study we assessed the concentration of linoleic  (LA) and  (ALA) in follicular fluid of prepubertal goats according to follicle size (<3mm or ≥3mm) by gas chromatography and tested the addition of different LA and ALA (LA:ALA) concentration ratios (50:50, 100:50 and 200:50µM) to the IVM medium on embryo development, mitochondrial activity, ATP concentration and relative gene expression (RPL19, ribosomal protein L19; SLC2A1, facilitated glucose transporter 1; ATF4, activating transcription factor 4; GPX1, glutathione peroxidase 1; HSPA5, heat-shock protein family A 70 kDa; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; DNMT1, DNA methyltransferase 1; GCLC, glutamate-cysteine ligase catalytic subunit; SOD1, superoxide dismutase 1). Oocytes were in vitro matured, fertilised or parthenogenetically activated and zygotes were cultured following conventional protocols. LA concentration ranged from 247 to 319µM and ALA concentration from 8.39 to 41.19µM without any effect of follicle size.

These results demonstrated that 9-EE-KODE induced apoptosis in HRA cells via the mitochondrial regulation pathway.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30125537>Dietary fish oil supplemented with vitamin E improves quality indicators of rooster cold-stored semen through reducing lipid peroxidation.</a></h2><p>Cockerel semen is sensitive to cooling, which limits chilled storage of semen for more than 24 h. Results of artificial insemination with cold-stored semen are not desirable. This study was conducted to evaluate the effects of dietary fish oil and vitamin E (vitE) for cold-storage of rooster semen and its effects on parameters of semen during 48 h cooling preservation. Roosters were assigned into four dietary treatments; 1) control group received a basal diet, 2) vitE group received a basal diet supplemented with 200 mg/kg vitE, 3) fish oil group (FO) received a basal diet supplemented with 2% fish oil and 4) fish oil and vitE group received a basal diet supplemented with 2% fish oil and 200 mg/kg vitE (FO + vitE). Semen samples were collected after 40 days of feeding and then diluted and cooled to 5 °C for preservation up to 2 days. Several quality indicators of sperm such as motion characteristics, membrane integrity, and viability, and abnormal morphology, activity of , lipid peroxidation and acrosome integrity of the sperm were assessed at different times of storage (0, 24 and 48 h). None of sperm were significantly affected by the diets at the start of storage (0 h, p > 0.05). FO and FO + vitE improved the percentage of total motility, viability, and  activity at 24 h (P ≤ 0.05). After 48 h, only FO + vitE group produced the higher percentage of total motility, viability and membrane integrity (P ≤ 0.05). Lipid peroxidation was significantly reduced in sperm obtained from roosters fed diets of FO + vitE and vitE compared to FO and control (P ≤ 0.05) at times of 24 and 48 h. There was no significant difference between control and vitE groups in none of parameters (P > 0.05). Integrity of acrosome and abnormal morphology were not significantly affected by the diets (P > 0.05). Supplementation of roosters' diet with 2% fish oil and 200 mg/kg vitamin E improved the quality of cold-stored semen by supporting several indicators of sperm quality through reducing lipid peroxidation.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

The interactions between BSA or LNA and ZnO NPs were studied.The presence of BSA or LNA affected the hydrodynamic size, zeta potential, UV-Vis, fluorescence, and synchronous fluorescence spectra of ZnO NPs, which indicated an interaction between BSA or LNA and NPs. Exposure to ZnO NPs with the presence of BSA significantly induced the damage to  and lysosomes in HepG2 cells, associated with an increase of intracellular Zn ions, but not intracellular superoxide. Paradoxically, the release of inflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) was decreased, which indicated the anti-inflammatory effects of ZnO NPs when BSA was present. The presence of LNA did not significantly affect all of these endpoints in HepG2 cells exposed to ZnO NPs and BSA.the results from the present study indicated that BSA-complexed LNA might modestly interact with ZnO NPs, but did not significantly affect ZnO NPs and BSA-induced biological effects in HepG2 cells.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29355756>GLA supplementation regulates PHD2 mediated hypoxia and mitochondrial apoptosis in DMBA induced mammary gland carcinoma.</a></h2><p>The aim of the present study is to evaluate the effect of gamma  (GLA) on mitochondrial mediated death apoptosis, hypoxic microenvironment and cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway against 7, 12-dimethylbenz (a) anthracene (DMBA) induced mammary gland carcinoma. The effects of GLA were evaluated morphologically and biochemically against DMBA induced mammary gland carcinoma. The metabolic study was done for evaluation of biomarkers using H NMR. The present study was also verified through immunoblotting and qRT-PCR studies for the evaluation of various pathways. GLA treatment has a delineate implementation upon morphology of the tissues when evaluated through carmine staining, hematoxyline and eosin staining and scanning electron microscopy. GLA also demarked a commendatory proclamation of the fifteen key serum metabolites analogous with amino  metabolism and fatty  metabolism when recognized throughH NMR studies. The immunoblotting and qRT-PCR studies accomplished that GLA mediated mitochondrial death apoptosis, curtail hypoxic microenvironment along with hindrance of de novo fatty  synthesis and also mediate the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway to proclaim its anticancer effects.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) play an important role in the formation of a cell membrane, along with the fluidity of the membrane and proteins. Gamma  (GLA) is member of the ω-6 family of PUFAs and converts into the arachidonic  via a series of elongation and desaturation reactions. The aim of the current investigation was to scrutinize the effect of GLA on mitochondrial mediated apoptosis and anti-inflammatory pathway against diethylnitrosamine (DEN) induced HCC.Chemical carcinogenesis in Wistar rats was introduced by an intra-peritoneal dose of DEN (200 mg/kg). The rats received the various doses of GLA for 22 weeks. The progressions of serum biomarkers and histopathology components of hepatic tissue were used to access the prophylactic effects. The antioxidant parameters, cancer preventive agent status, and apoptosis mechanism were reviewed to scrutinize the possible mechanism.Dose-dependent treatment of GLA significantly (<-0.001) modulated the hepatic nodules, hepatic, body weight, antioxidant, and non-hepatic parameters. Curiously, the Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunoblotting showed the GLA altered reduced the hypoxic microenvironment, mitochondrial mediated death apoptosis, and anti-inflammsatory pathways.On the basis of the above results, we can conclude that the GLA exhibited a chemo-protective effect against DEN induced HCC that might be due to the altered hypoxic microenvironment, mitochondrial mediated death apoptosis, and anti-inflammatory pathway, respectively.</p></html>
