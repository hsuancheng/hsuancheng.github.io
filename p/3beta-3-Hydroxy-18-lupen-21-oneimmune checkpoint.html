<html><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31681606>The Controversial Role of PD-1 and Its Ligands in Gynecological Malignancies.</a></h1><p>The programmed death-1 (PD-1, CD279) receptor with its ligands, programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1, CD274, B7-H1), and programmed death ligand 2 (PD-L2, CD273, B7-DC), are the key players of one of the   pathways inhibiting T- activation. PD-L1 and PD-L2 are expressed in different cancer cells and their microenvironment, including infiltrating  cells. However, their prognostic value is still debated and their role in the tumor microenvironment has not been fully elucidated yet. Considering the importance that cancer immunotherapy with anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 antibodies gained in several tumor types, in this review article we aim to discuss the role of the PD-1/PD-L1/PD-L2 axis in gynecological cancers. PD-1 ligands have been detected in ovarian, cervical, vulvar and uterine cancers, and correlation with prognosis seems dependent from their distribution. About PD-L2, very few reports are available so far in gynecological malignancies, and its role is still not completely understood. Clinical trials using anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 antibodies, but not anti-PD-L2, are currently ongoing, in all types of gynecological cancers. They have shown good safety profiles in a certain cohort of patients, but response rates remain low and many aspects remain controversial. In this review, we propose possible solutions to enhance the clinical efficacy of PD-1 axis targeting therapies. Regarding PD-L2, it might be useful to better clarify its role in order to improve the efficiency of immunotherapy in female malignancies.Copyright © 2019 Marinelli, Annibali, Aguzzi, Tuyaerts, Amant, Morelli, Santoni, Amantini, Maggi and Nabissi.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662748>Gastric Cancer in the Era of   Blockade.</a></h1><p>Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the most important malignancies worldwide because of its high incidence and mortality. The very low survival rates are mainly related to late diagnosis and limited treatment options. GC is the final clinical outcome of a stepwise process that starts with a chronic and sustained inflammatory reaction mounted in response to  infection. The bacterium modulates innate and adaptive immunity presumably as part of the strategies to survive, which favors the creation of an immunosuppressive microenvironment that ultimately facilitates GC progression. T- exhaustion, which is characterized by elevated expression of   (IC) proteins, is one of the most salient manifestations of immunosuppressive microenvironments. It has been consistently demonstrated that the tumor- microenvironment(TIME)-exhausted phenotype can be reverted by blocking ICs with monoclonal antibodies. Although these therapies are associated with long-lasting response rates, only a subset of patients derive clinical benefit, which varies according to tumor site. The search for biomarkers to predict the response to IC inhibition is a matter of intense investigation as this may contribute to maximize disease control, reduce side effects, and minimize cost. The approval of pembrolizumab for its use in GC has rocketed immuno-oncology research in this cancer type. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge centered around the  contexture and recent findings in connection with IC inhibition in GC.Copyright © 2019 Lucía Figueroa-Protti et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666472>Paraneoplastic Remitting Seronegative Symmetrical Synovitis with Pitting Edema Syndrome Should be Treated with Low-dose Prednisolone During Pembrolizumab Therapy: The Author's Reply.</a></h1><p></p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649889>Vitiligo Adverse Event Observed in a Patient With Durable Complete Response After Nivolumab for Metastatic Renal  Carcinoma.</a></h1><p> Renal  carcinoma is the third most prevalent urological cancer worldwide and about 30% of patients present with metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis. Systemic treatments for metastatic renal  carcinoma have improved recently. Vascular endothelial growth factor targeting therapies were the previous standard of care. However,   inhibitors used in second line therapy have now been shown to improve patient survival. We report a case of metastatic renal  carcinoma with nivolumab as a second-line therapy after progression with tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy. Unusual adverse events in metastatic renal  carcinoma, such as vitiligo, were observed in this patient who developed a remarkable documented pathological complete response to his renal tumor.  A 60-year-old caucasian male was diagnosed with a pulmonary metastatic clear  renal  carcinoma. Sunitinib was used as first line treatment without success. He received nivolumab in second-line treatment. He developed several -related adverse events, most notably vitiligo. The patient had a radiological complete response on metastatic sites, with a significant decrease of renal tumor volume and underwent cytoreductive nephrectomy after 2 years of treatment, confirming the pathological complete response. The patient remains disease-free for 10 months without further systemic therapy after nivolumab discontinuation.  Pathological complete response with nivolumab in metastatic renal  carcinoma is rare. This case further highlights the potentially predictive role of -related adverse events during nivolumab therapy for metastatic renal  carcinoma and raises questions concerning the role of nephrectomy after   inhibitor therapy. Further studies are needed to better identify predictive factors for treatment response to immunotherapy in metastatic renal  carcinoma, and to better understand the role of nephrectomy after nivolumab treatment.Copyright © 2019 Billon, Walz, Brunelle, Thomassin, Salem, Guerin, Vicier, Dermeche, Albiges, Tantot, Nenan, Pignot and Gravis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692041>Combination of attenuated Salmonella carrying PD-1 siRNA with nifuroxazide for colon cancer therapy.</a></h1><p>Colon cancer is a member of malignant tumors in the digestive system. Traditional treatment strategies are ineffective and improving the treatment of colon cancer is an urgent need. Targeting programmed  death-1 (PD-1) by monoclonal antibodies has shown some therapeutic effectiveness and has advantages. Additionally, the Stat3 inhibitor nifuroxazide was employed to promote the antitumor activity. Here, we hypothesized that combining nifuroxazide with PD-1 small interfering RNA carried by attenuated Salmonella would exert a synergistic antitumor effect on colon cancer. Indeed, treatment with this combination effectively inhibited the development of colon cancer in mice and improved the survival rate. These two novel anticancer agents worked synergistically to elicit potent antitumor immunity and achieve improved therapeutic efficacy. The underlying mechanisms are mainly involved with  regulation and  apoptosis. This study provides a previous framework for combining this Stat3 inhibitor with RNAi designed to block   signaling for cancer therapy.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654628>Cervical cancer patients that respond to chemoradiation therapy display an intense tumor infiltrating  profile before treatment.</a></h1><p>Cervical cancer (CC) is a major cause of death and suffering to women globally with 570,000 new cases in 2017. It disproportionately affects those living in resource-constrained countries such as Brazil, with 90% of the deaths from CC happening in low and middle-income countries. Early detection is still the best strategy for improving response to therapy and survival and cases detected in advanced stages show variable response rates to the standard chemoradiation therapy protocols. Both the genetic landscape and the  status of patients can dramatically affect cancer progression and response to therapy, as well as disease recurrence. Here we performed a comprehensive sequencing analysis using the cancer gene panel - Ion AmpliSeq™ Cancer hotspot Panel V2 CHPv2, as well as determined the  infiltrate composition of a group of locally advanced CC patients with the goal of identifying genetic and  characteristics associated with a clinical response to therapy. The expression levels of CD68 tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and CD8 tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), as well as the   molecules PD-1, PD-L1 and PD-L2 in stroma and in tumor regions were analyzed by immunohistochemistry (IHC). The HPV infection status with high-risk strains was also determined. Twenty-one samples from patients with squamous  carcinoma segregated into responder (11) and non-responder (10) groups according to standard chemoradiation therapy response were studied. Our findings indicate that responder patients showed an increase of an inflammatory tumor microenvironment as indicated by higher numbers of CD8 and PD-L2 TILs, as well as higher expression of PD-L1 immunoreactive area, as compared to the non-responder group. Additionally, our results demonstrate a correlation between the number of gene mutations and PD-L2 TILs in the responder group. The genes PIK3CA and KDR/VEGFR were the most mutated genes, corroborating past findings. Together, these findings indicate an inflammatory tumor microenvironment present in patients that will respond to future chemoradiation treatment as compared to those that will not. This points to possible future predictors of response to therapy in CC patients.Copyright © 2019.

We demonstrated the concept for a sensitive method to determine Ag-reactive T  clones based on clonal expansion using model neoantigens (NeoAgs) rather than cytokine production. Sequential increase in T  clonal frequencies following Ag stimulation was detected by next generation sequencing (NGS) of T  receptor β (TCR β) complementarity-determining region 3 (CDR3), with a higher sensitivity than that of enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) by 100-fold. The TCRβ CDR3 sequences could represent useful markers to track dynamic changes during immunotherapy. The TCRβ NGS-based method could represent a novel platform both for the development of new biomarkers as well as several therapeutic options.Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

With the next-generation sequencing methodologies, more knowledge is gathered about gut microbiome and its irreplaceable role in keeping the balance between human health and diseases is figured out.   inhibitors (ICIs) are one of the most innovational cancer immunotherapies across cancer types and significantly expand the therapeutic options of cancer patients. However, a proportion of patients show no effective responses or develop -related adverse events when responses do occur. More important, it is demonstrated that the therapeutic response or treatment-limiting toxicity of cancer immunotherapy can be ameliorated or diminished by gut microbiome modulation. In this review, we first introduce the relationship between gut microbiome and cancer immunotherapy. And then, we expound the impact of gut microbiome on efficacy and toxicity of cancer immunotherapy. Further, we review approaches to manipulating gut microbiome to regulate response to ICIs. Finally, we discuss the current challenges and propose future directions to improve cancer immunotherapy via gut microbiome manipulation.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31685311>  inhibitor nephrotoxicity: what do we know and what should we do?</a></h1><p>  inhibitors have dramatically improved cancer therapy for many patients. These humanized monoclonal antibodies against various   (receptors and ligands) effectively treat a number of malignancies by unleashing the  system to destroy cancer cells. These drugs are not excreted by the kidneys or liver, have a long half-life, and undergo receptor-mediated clearance. Although these agents have greatly improved the prognosis of many cancers, -related end organ injury is a complication that has come to light in clinical practice. Although less common than other organ involvement, kidney lesions resulting in acute kidney injury and/or proteinuria are being described. Acute tubulointerstitial nephritis is the most common lesion seen on kidney biopsy, while acute tubular injury and glomerular lesions occur less commonly. Clinical findings and laboratory tests are suboptimal in predicting the underlying renal lesion, making kidney biopsy necessary in the majority of cases to definitely diagnose the lesion and potentially guide therapy.   inhibitor discontinuation and corticosteroid therapy are recommended for acute tubulointerstitial nephritis. Based on a handful of cases, re-exposure to these drugs in patients who previously developed acute tubulointerstitial nephritis has been mixed. Although it is unclear whether re-exposure is appropriate, it should perhaps be considered in patients with limited options. When this approach is taken, patients should be closely monitored for recurrence of acute kidney injury. Treatment of cancer in patients with a kidney transplant with   inhibitors risks the development of acute rejection in some patients and requires close surveillance.Copyright © 2019 International Society of Nephrology.

Until 2006, non-specific immunotherapy with high dose interleukin-2 (HD IL-2) was considered as standard therapy of mccRCC. The transition from cytokine to targeted therapy, and now to novel immunotherapeutic agents, significantly increased the overall survival (OS) of patients with mccRCC. Currently, 7 targeted agents and the combination of nivolumab/ipilimumab (  inhibitors, ICIs) have been approved as first-line therapy for mccRCC. Based on evidence from randomized phase III clinical trials, sunitinib and pazopanib (Tyrosine kinase inhibitors of vascular endothelial growth factor; VEGF-TKIs) are the most effective first-line options, especially in favorable and indermediate risk patients. Nivolumab/ipilimumab (dual  inhibitors) seem to be the preferred first-line therapy in poor-risk patients, although cabozantinib, temsirolimus, sunitinib and pazopanib are also recommended. HD IL-2 remains a reasonable first-line treatment option in selected, favorable-risk younger patients with good performance status. Based on data of previous phase I and II studies, several phase III trials investigating the efficacy and safety of the combination of ICI/VEGF-TKI versus sunitinib in untreated mccRCC are currently underway. These emerging therapies include the combinations of pembrolizumab/lenvatinib, pembrolizumab/axitinib, avelumab/axitinib and atezolizumab/ bevacizu-mab and seem to introduce the mccRCC therapy in a new auspicious era. Moreover, emerging new targeted therapies and other, beyond ICIs, immunotherapies are currently underway.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31653838>Mild photothermal therapy potentiates anti-PD-L1 treatment for immunologically cold tumors via an all-in-one and all-in-control strategy.</a></h1><p>One of the main challenges for   blockade antibodies lies in malignancies with limited T- responses or immunologically "cold" tumors. Inspired by the capability of fever-like heat in inducing an -favorable tumor microenvironment, mild photothermal therapy (PTT) is proposed to sensitize tumors to   inhibition and turn "cold" tumors "hot." Here we present a combined all-in-one and all-in-control strategy to realize a local symbiotic mild photothermal-assisted immunotherapy (SMPAI). We load both a near-infrared (NIR) photothermal agent IR820 and a programmed death-ligand 1 antibody (aPD-L1) into a lipid gel depot with a favorable property of thermally reversible gel-to-sol phase transition. Manually controlled NIR irradiation regulates the release of aPD-L1 and, more importantly, increases the recruitment of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and boosts T- activity against tumors. In vivo antitumor studies on 4T1 and B16F10 models demonstrate that SMPAI is an effective and promising strategy for treating "cold" tumors.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31678303>Disruption of SIRT7 Increases the Efficacy of  Inhibitor via MEF2D Regulation of PD-L1 in Hepatocellular Carcinoma Cells.</a></h1><p>  inhibitors have some efficacy in treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Programmed  death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1), expressed on some cancer cells, binds to the receptor programmed  death 1 (PDCD1, also called PD1) on T cells to prevent their proliferation and reduce the antigen-tumor  response.  cells that infiltrate some types of HCCs secrete interferon gamma (IFNG). Some HCC cells express myocyte enhancer factor 2D (MEF2D), which has been associated with shorter survival times of patients. We studied whether HCC  expression of MEF2D regulates expression of PD-L1 in response to IFNG.We analyzed  cells from 20 fresh HCC tissues by flow cytometry. We analyzed 225 fixed HCC tissues (from 2 cohorts) from patients in China by immunohistochemistry and obtained survival data. We created mice with liver-specific knockout of MEF2D (MEF2D mice). We knocked out or knocked down MEF2D, E1A binding protein p300 (p300), or sirtuin 7 (SIRT7) in SMMC-7721, Huh7, H22, and Hepa1-6 HCC  lines, some incubated with IFNG. We analyzed liver tissues form mice and  lines by RNA sequence, immunoblot, dual luciferase reporter, and chromatin precipitation assays. MEF2D protein acetylation and proteins that interact with MEF2D were identified by co-immunoprecipitation and pull-down assays. H22 cells, with MEF2D knockout or without (controls) were transplanted into BALB/c mice, some mice were given antibodies to deplete T cells. Mice bearing orthotopic tumors grown from HCC cells with or without knockout of SIRT7, were given injections of an antibody against PD1. Growth of tumors was measured and tumors were analyzed by immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry.In human HCC specimens, we found an inverse correlation between level of MEF2D and numbers of CD4 and CD8 T cells; level of MEF2D correlated with percentages of PD1-positive or TIM3-positive CD8 T cells. Knockout of MEF2D from H22 cells reduced their growth as allograft tumors in -competent mice, but not in -deficient mice or mice with depletion of CD8 T cells. When MEF2D-knockout cells were injected into -competent mice, they formed smaller tumors that had increased infiltration and activation of T cells, compared with control HCC cells. In human and mouse HCC cells, MEF2D knockdown or knockout reduced expression of PD-L1. MEF2D bound the promoter region of the CD274 gene (encodes PD-L1) and activated its transcription. Overexpression of p300 in HCC cells, or knockout of SIRT7, promoted acetylation of MEF2D and increased its binding, along with acetylated histones, to the promoter region of the CD274. Exposure of HCC cells to IFNG induced expression of p300 and its binding MEF2D, which reduced the interaction between MEF2D and SIRT7. MEF2D-induced expression of PD-L1 upon IFNG exposure was independent of interferon-regulatory factor 1 (IRF1) or IRF9. In HCC cells not exposed to IFNG, SIRT7 formed a complex with MEF2D that attenuated expression of PD-L1. Knockout of SIRT7 reduced proliferation of HCC cells and growth of tumors in -deficient mice. Compared with allograft tumors grown from control HCC cells, in -competent mice, tumors grown from SIRT7-knockout HCC cells expressed higher level of PD-L1 and had reduced infiltration and activation of T cells. In -competent mice given antibodies to PD1, allograft tumors grew more slowly from SIRT7-knockout HCC cells than from control HCC cells.Expression MEF2D by HCC cells increases their expression of PD-L1, which prevents CD8 T -mediated anti-tumor immunity. When HCC cells are exposed to IFNG, p300 acetylates MEF2D, causing it to bind the CD274 gene promoter and upregulate PD-L1 expression. In addition to promoting HCC  proliferation, SIRT7 reduced acetylation of MEF2D and expression of PD-L1 in HCC cells not exposed to IFNG. Strategies to manipulate this pathway might increase the efficacy of  therapies for HCC.Copyright © 2019 AGA Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.

PD-L1 expression in 24 surgical chordoma specimen was determined immunohistochemically with antibodies 28-8 and E1L3N. The ability of patient-derived organoids to detect treatment effects of nivolumab was explored by quantitative and qualitative immunofluorescence and FACS analysis. The more sensitive antibody, E1L3N (ROC = 0.896, p = 0.001), was associated with greater tumour diameters (p = 0.014) and detected both tumour cells and infiltrating lymphocytes in 54% of patients, but only 1-15% of their cells. Organoids generated from PD-L1-positive patients contained both tumour cells and PD-1/CD8-positive lymphocytes and responded to nivolumab treatment with marked dose-dependent diameter reductions of up to 50% and increased  death in both PD-L1-positive and negative organoids.

Second-line chemotherapy with 6 cycles of carboplatin, paclitaxel, and bevacizumab resulted in a partial response for 6 months.  inhibition with nivolumab was started due to progression, leading to persistent complete remission. Immunotherapy was well tolerated for 8 months until the patient presented with an -related isolated vulvitis, which was successfully managed with topical corticosteroids.The persistent complete response after third-line treatment for relapsed chemotherapy-resistant cervical cancer presented in this case highlights the potential of immunotherapy for patients with advanced cervical cancer impressively. To our knowledge, this is the first report of an isolated -related vulvitis under nivolumab. This adverse event might be underdiagnosed and mistreated, however, it is of importance due to its impact on quality of life, sexual wellbeing and compliance of patients. Successful IRAE management may enable prolonged   inhibitor therapy. In the future, routine molecular tumour profiling is likely to aid in the stratification of cervical cancer patients for immunotherapy. Here, we provide the methylome data of a case with complete response.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664934>Severe colitis after PD-1 blockade with nivolumab in advanced melanoma patients: potential role of Th1-dominant  response in -related adverse events: two case reports.</a></h1><p>Nivolumab is an   inhibitor specific to the programmed death 1 (PD-1) receptor. Nivolumab has shown clinical responses in many malignancies. Although -related adverse events (irAEs) associated with nivolumab are largely tolerable, severe irAEs have occurred in some patients. However, the mechanisms underlying the development of irAEs are not fully clarified.We report 2 patients with metastatic melanoma who developed colitis, an irAEs caused by nivolumab. Both patients experienced colitis after nivolumab administration. Pathological examination of the colon showed robust infiltration of CD8 cells and T-bet expressing CD4 cells in both cases, indicating helper T cells (Th) 1 to be responsible for the dominant response. Additionally, we observed the serum C-reactive protein level (CRP) as well as interleukin-6 (IL-6) reflected the clinical course of irAEs clearly in the two cases.Our two cases suggested that the development of irAEs due to nivolumab is associated with Th1 dominant response. CRP as well as IL-6 was found to be a potential biomarker for irAEs. Our findings may help to understand the mechanisms underlying irAEs caused by nivolumab and manage irAEs in clinical practice.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31653633>Acute kidney injury from   inhibitor use.</a></h1><p>  inhibitors are novel oncological medications, current classes of which include monoclonal antibodies that target inhibitory receptors cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA-4), programmed death 1 protein (PD-1) and programmed death-ligand 1.

Most recently the addition of atezolizumab to chemotherapy in the first-line treatment of extensive-stage small  lung cancer (ES-SCLC) resulted in improved overall survival and progression-free survival compared to chemotherapy alone. Recent randomized studies examining both consolidative thoracic radiotherapy and prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) in ES-SCLC have impacted the utilization of these interventions. The approval of   inhibitors (ICIs) to platinum/etoposide chemotherapy for the treatment of ES-SCLC in the front-line setting may also further impact the role of radiotherapy in this disease. In this article, we review the current evidence supporting thoracic radiotherapy in ES-SCLC and discuss the promising therapeutic implications of thoracic radiation in light of the inclusion of ICIs. We also address how the increasing routine use of surveillance brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ICIs may diminish the use of PCI in ES-SCLC.2019 Translational Lung Cancer Research.

However, -related adverse events associated with these agents frequently affect various organs, mimicking auto- or inflammatory diseases. Some of these effects can be severe, often requiring hospitalization and specialized treatment (immunosuppression). Most known agents are ipilimumab (anti-CTLA-4 antibody) nivolumab and pembrolizumab (anti-PD-1 antibodies). New molecules are now approved or in development as anti-PD-L1 antibodies, anti-LAG-3 or anti-TIM-3 antibodies, increasing the probability and new description of -related adverse events. With his experience in auto- diseases, the immunologist/internal medicine specialist has an important role in the management of these toxicities.

Immunotherapy-related hepatitis and cholangitis present a diagnostic and management challenge, being rare and incompletely characterised. We aim to report the incidence, features and treatments used for this in a real-world setting and to identify useful biomarkers, which can be used to predict effective use of steroids.Retrospective review of 453 patients started on immunotherapy over 7 years.Tertiary hepatology and oncology centre.21 patients identified with immunotherapy-related hepatotoxicity.Hepatitis was most common in those receiving dual therapy (incidence 20%), with 75% of Grade 4 hepatitis cases occurring with ipilimumab-containing regimens. Corticosteroid monotherapy is first line treatment, but doses above 60 mg OD prednisolone do not demonstrate any additional benefit in time to hepatitis resolution. The alanine transaminase (ALT) reduction in steroid-responsive hepatitis is typically rapid (with a halving of ALT within 11 days). The commencement of additional immunosuppression (typically mycophenolate) appears safe and prompts a more rapid fall in ALT than corticosteroid use alone. Infliximab was safely used twice as hepatitis treatment. We also describe one patient with rare immunotherapy-induced biliary disease.Vigilance is required for detection of immunotherapy-associated liver disease as, other than dual immunotherapy, we can identify no predictive factors for its development. Our data suggest that corticosteroid response is not dependent on the higher dosing regimens. Early escalation of immunosuppression may be of benefit in the absence of a rapid response to corticosteroids.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019. No commercial re-use.

Although some patients achieve durable responses to  blockade, not all experience such benefits, and some suffer from significant immunotoxicities. Given this, biomarkers that predict response to therapy are essential, and testing for tumor programmed death ligand 1(PD-L1) expression is the current standard. The extent of PD-L1 expression determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC) has demonstrated a correlation with treatment response, although limitations with this marker exist. Recently, tumor mutational burden has emerged as an alternative biomarker, and studies have demonstrated its utility, irrespective of the PD-L1 level of a tumor. Gene expression signatures, tumor genotype (such as the presence of an oncogenic driver mutation), as well as the density of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes in the tumor microenvironment also seem to affect response to immunotherapy and are being researched. Peripheral serum markers are being studied, and some have demonstrated predictive ability, although most are still investigational and need prospective validation. In the current article, the authors review the biomarker PD-L1 as well as other emerging and investigational tissue-based and serum-based markers that have potential to better predict responders to immunotherapy.© 2019 American Cancer Society.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31646612>Immunotoxicity from  inhibitor therapy: clinical features and underlying mechanisms.</a></h1><p>  inhibition with monoclonal antibodies is becoming increasingly commonplace in cancer medicine, having contributed to a widening of therapeutic options across oncological indications.

However,   blockade is still suboptimal in HCC treatment and more  modifications are needed to achieve an efficient therapeutic goal. Here, we investigated the combined administration of a Listeria-based HCC vaccine, Lmdd-MPFG, and the anti-PD-1   blockade antibody. We found that Lmdd-MPFG promoted the expression of PD-L1 in HCC cells but resensitized the tumor local T  to respond to the anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. Mechanistically, the Lmdd-MPFG vaccine activates the NF-κB pathway in the tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) through the TLR2 and MyD88 pathway, and recruits p62 to activate the autophagy pathway. The overall effect is skewing the TAMs from M2-polarized TAMs into the M1-polarized TAMs. Most importantly, it skewed the cytokine profiles into antitumor one in the tumor microenvironment (TME). This change restores the T- reactivity to the anti-PD-1 blockade. Our results suggested that Lmdd-MPFG combined with PD-1 blockade exerted synergistic antitumor effects through modifying TAMs in the TME and removing T- inhibitory signals, thereby providing a new potential strategy for HCC treatment.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666701>The clinical KRAS(G12C) inhibitor AMG 510 drives anti-tumour immunity.</a></h1><p>KRAS is the most frequently mutated oncogene in cancer and encodes a key signalling protein in tumours. The KRAS(G12C) mutant has a cysteine residue that has been exploited to design covalent inhibitors that have promising preclinical activity. Here we optimized a series of inhibitors, using novel binding interactions to markedly enhance their potency and selectivity. Our efforts have led to the discovery of AMG 510, which is, to our knowledge, the first KRAS(G12C) inhibitor in clinical development. In preclinical analyses, treatment with AMG 510 led to the regression of KRAS tumours and improved the anti-tumour efficacy of chemotherapy and targeted agents. In -competent mice, treatment with AMG 510 resulted in a pro-inflammatory tumour microenvironment and produced durable cures alone as well as in combination with - inhibitors. Cured mice rejected the growth of isogenic KRAS tumours, which suggests adaptive immunity against shared antigens. Furthermore, in clinical trials, AMG 510 demonstrated anti-tumour activity in the first dosing cohorts and represents a potentially transformative therapy for patients for whom effective treatments are lacking.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31679184>  inhibitor-associated pituitary-adrenal dysfunction: A systematic review and meta-analysis.</a></h1><p>With the growing use of   inhibitors (ICIs), case reports of rare yet life-threatening pituitary-adrenal dysfunctions, particularly for hypopituitarism, are increasingly being published. In this analysis, we focus on these events by including the most recent publications and reports from early phase I/II and phase III clinical trials and comparing the incidence and risks across different ICI regimens. PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library were systematically searched from inception to April 2019 for clinical trials that reported on pituitary-adrenal dysfunction. The rates of events, odds ratios (ORs), and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were obtained using random effects meta-analysis. The analyses included data from 160 trials involving 40 432 participants. The rate was 2.43% (95% CI, 1.73%-3.22%) for all-grade adrenal insufficiency and 3.25% (95% CI, 2.15%-4.51%) for hypophysitis. Compared with the placebo or other therapeutic regimens, ICI agents were associated with a higher incidence of serious-grade adrenal insufficiency (OR 3.19, 95% CI, 1.84 to 5.54) and hypophysitis (OR 4.77, 95% CI, 2.60 to 8.78). Among 71 serious-grade hypopituitarism instances in 12 336 patients, there was a significant association between ICIs and hypopituitarism (OR 3.62, 95% CI, 1.86 to 7.03). Substantial heterogeneity was noted across the studies for the rates of these events, which in part was attributable to the different types of ICIs and varied phases of the clinical trials. Although the rates of these events were low, the risk was increased following ICI-based treatment, particularly for CTLA-4 inhibitors, which were associated with a higher incidence of pituitary-adrenal dysfunction than PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors.© 2019 The Authors.

However, in comparison with widely adopted mono-  inhibitors, chemotherapy, and targeted therapy, the advantage of combination therapy of α-PD-1 and α-CTLA-4 in response rate and prognosis is controversial especially considering probably increased treatment related adverse event. Thus, we conducted this meta-analysis to explore the efficacy and safety of combination treatment of α-PD-1 and α-CTLA-4.This meta-analysis involved 8 clinical trials. In most trials, the primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR). Thus we calculated risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) to compare ORR of patients undergoing different treatment strategies. Moreover, the co-primary endpoints in few trials included progression-free survival and overall survival. Hazard ratio (HR) with 95% CI were employed to weigh the influence of different treatments on prognosis of patients. Subgroup analysis was conducted in patients with high and low expression of PD-L1. Lastly, the safety of combination therapy was evaluated by comparing treatment related adverse events among various treatment groups.Our results showed that ORR was significantly higher in patients receiving α-PD-1 plus α-CTLA-4 compared with α-PD-1 (RR 1.31, 95% CI 1.16-1.48) or α-CTLA-4 monotherapy (RR 2.11, 95% CI 1.84-2.43), chemotherapy and targeted therapy (RR 1.41, 95% CI 1.26-1.58). α-PD-1 plus α-CTLA-4 treated patients had a great advantage on monotherapy, chemotherapy and targeted therapy treated patients in PFS. Notably, no significant alteration in total adverse event rate was observed in α-PD-1 plus α-CTLA-4 treated patients. Results of subgroup analysis showed that combination therapy could enhance anti-tumor response in comparison with other treatments, especially for low PD-L1 expression patients undergoing nivolumab treatment (ORR: RR 1.35, 95% CI 1.11-1.65).Combination treatment of α-PD-1 and α-CTLA-4 is a feasible strategy with enhanced efficacy and acceptable adverse event. Moreover, for some low PD-L1 expression patients, α-CTLA-4 might decrease the risk of resistance to α-PD-1 and demonstrate the synergistic anti-tumor effect.© The Author(s) 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31650066>First-in-human phase I clinical trial of a combined  modulatory approach using TetMYB vaccine and Anti-PD-1 antibody in patients with advanced solid cancer including colorectal or adenoid cystic carcinoma: The MYPHISMO study protocol (NCT03287427).</a></h1><p>MYB is a transcription factor that is overexpressed in colorectal cancer (CRC) and also a driver mutation in adenoid cystic carcinoma (AdCC). Therefore, the MYB protein is an ideal target to vaccinate against to aid recruitment of tumour infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) against these tumours. The Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre (Melbourne, Australia) has engineered a DNA vaccine, TetMYB, based on the pVAX1 plasmid vector carrying a fusion construct consisting of the universal tetanus toxin T- epitopes flanking an inactivated  gene.This prospective first-in-human phase I single-arm multi-centre clinical trial involves patients with metastatic CRC or AdCC. Stage 1 will evaluate the safety profile of escalating doses of TetMYB vaccine, given sequentially and in combination with an anti-PD-1 inhibitory antibody, to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Stage 2 will assess the MTD in an expanded cohort. The calculated sample size is 32 patients: 12 in Stage 1 and 20 in Stage 2. The expected total duration of the trial is 3 years with 15 months of recruitment followed by a minimum of 18 months follow-up.MYB transcription factor is aberrantly overexpressed in a range of epithelial cancers, not limited to the above tumour types. Based on promising pre-clinical data of vaccine-induced tumour clearance and establishment of anti-tumour memory, we are embarking on this first-in-human trial. If successful, the results from this trial will allow progression to a Phase II trial and validation of this breakthrough immunotherapeutic approach, not only in CRC and AdCC, but other MYB over-expressing cancers.ClinicalTrials.gov ID: .

However, limited progress with Tim-3 immunotherapy has been achieved over the last decade due to the lack of specific Tim-3 monoclonal antibodies. In this study, we have successfully developed a unique set of Tim-3 antibodies that are able to detect different molecular weights (by Western blot mobility) of Tim-3 proteins ectopically expressed in the same CHO cells. Some of the antibody clones detect only 33 or 55 kDa bands, the rest can recognize both 33 and 55 kDa bands on polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gel. Antibody clones with 55 kDa specificity uniquely bind to the membrane form of Tim-3 on macrophage, which colocalizes with the CD68, and could be used as a specific marker for tumor-associated macrophage, whereas other clones showed cytoplasmic staining in tumor cells. The membrane form of Tim-3 on tumor-associated macrophages may bear significant roles for clinical application of Tim-3, but less likely for cytoplasmic one. The availability of this unique set of antibodies will be critical for an ultimate understanding of Tim-3 function in tumor microenvironment and potential clinical applications.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31683809>Hyperprogressive Disease during Anti-PD-1 (PDCD1) / PD-L1 (CD274) Therapy: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.</a></h1><p>Hyperprogressive disease (HPD) is a recently acknowledged pattern of rapid tumor progression after the initiation of   inhibitors. HPD has been observed across various types of tumors and has been associated with poor survival. We performed a meta-analysis to identify baseline (i.e., prior to programmed  death 1 [PD-1, PDCD1] / programmed  death 1 ligand 1 [PD-L1, CD274] inhibitor therapy) patient factors associated with risks of developing HPD during PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor therapy. We searched eight databases until 6 June 2019. We calculated the summary odds ratio (OR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI) using the random-effects model and explored between-study heterogeneity and small-study effects. A total of nine articles was eligible (217 HPD cases, 1519 cancer patients) for meta-analysis. There was no standard definition of HPD, and the incidence of HPD ranged from 1 to 30%. We identified twenty-three baseline patient factors, of which five factors were statistically significantly associated with HPD. These were serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) above the upper normal limit (OR = 1.89, 95% CI = 1.02-3.49,  = 0.043), more than two metastatic sites (OR = 1.86, 1.34-2.57,  < 0.001), liver metastases (OR = 3.33, 2.07-5.34,  < 0.001), Royal Marsden Hospital prognostic score of 2 or above (OR = 3.33, 1.96-5.66,  < 0.001), and positive PD-L1 expression status that was inversely correlated with HPD (OR = 0.60, 0.36-0.99,  = 0.044). Between-study heterogeneity was low. Evidence of small-study effect was found in one association (PD-L1 expression). Subset analyses of patients with non-small  lung cancer showed similar results.

However, the significance of the PD-L1 expression in esophageal squamous  carcinoma (ESCC) patients receiving neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy remains unclear.By means of PD-L1 immunohistochemistry 22C3 pharmDx assay, we evaluate the PD-L1 expression and its association with clinical outcome in 107 ESCC patients receiving neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy.Patients with positive PD-L1 expression have significantly lower pathological complete response rates (13% versus 32%; P = 0.036) than those with negative PD-L1 expression. Univariate survival analysis found that positive PD-L1 expression were correlated with poor overall survival (P = 0.004) and inferior disease-free survival (P < 0.001). In a multivariate analysis, positive PD-L1 expression was independently associated with the absence of a pathologically complete response (P = 0.044, hazard ratio: 3.542), worse overall survival (P = 0.006, hazard ratio: 2.017), and inferior disease-free survival (P < 0.001, hazard ratio: 2.516).For patients with ESCC receiving neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, positive PD-L1 expression independently predicts the poor chemoradiotherapy response and worse treatment outcome.

The awareness of -related adverse events is key to ensuring both diagnosis and management of the possible serious adverse events. Although severe -related adverse events remain rare, they can lead to discontinued treatment or to death if they are not forecasted and managed properly.

PD-L1 represents a predictive biomarker in lung cancer, although its heterogenous expression represents an emerging challenge for accurate biomarker-based patient selection. Lung adenocarcinomas (ADCs) show a high rate of intratumor morphologic heterogeneity that may reflect a heterogenous molecular and immunophenotypic profile. The aim of our study was to analyze the expression of PD-L1 in different intratumor subtypes and/or growth patterns in a series of mixed adenocarcinomas (mADCs) and adenosquamous lung carcinomas (AdSqLCs). As many as 73 mADCs and 6 AdSqLCs were selected. Comprehensive histologic subtyping was performed, and PD-L1 expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry assay using different primary antibodies and automated immunostainers. Overall, PD-L1 expression was observed in 37 of 79 cases (39.2%) (31 mADCs and all AdSqLCs). PD-L1 expression was heterogenous in 22 of 37 PD-L1-positive cases (23.2% mADC and 83% AdSqLC). PD-L1 expression was observed more frequently in ADC with solid pattern. Heterogeneity of PD-L1 expression was significantly related to the presence of micropapillary (P=0.028) and solid (P=0.017) patterns. All PD-L1-positive cases were epidermal growth factor receptor wild-type, 2 cases harbored concomitantly PD-L1 expression and ALK rearrangement. Our data suggest that PD-L1 expression is quite heterogenous in mADCs and AdSqLCs, partly contributing to explaining the discrepant results between biopsy and surgical resections and discordant clinical effectiveness in regard to PD-L1-positive or negative ADC diagnosed on cytology/small biopsy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31679185>Comparisons between tumor burden and other prognostic factors that influence survival of patients with non-small  lung cancer treated with   inhibitors.</a></h1><p>The use of baseline tumor burden (TB) as a prognostic factor for non-small  lung cancer (NSCLC) patients treated with   inhibitors (ICIs) and associations between TB and other prognostic biomarkers remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the association between TB and survival in NSCLC patients treated with ICIs in comparison with other biomarkers.We retrospectively evaluated 83 NSCLC patients with ICIs administered between February 2016 and December 2018. TB was measured as the sum of the unidimensional diameters of up to five target lesions.The median observation period was 14.2 months. A total of 42 patients died during the follow-up. Univariate Cox regression analysis showed that baseline TB was associated with OS. Cox regression analysis adjusted for Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS) alone or with addition of programmed  death ligand 1 expression and treatment line showed that TB was a prognostic factor for OS. Using time-dependent receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, the optimal TB cutoff for predicting OS was 12 cm, and patients were divided into a high TB group (n = 21) and a low TB group (n = 62). The low TB group achieved significantly longer OS than the high TB group (median OS: 18.5 months, [95% CI = 11.7-not reached] vs. 2.3 months [95% CI = 1.3-2.9], P < 0.001).TB is a useful, clinically measurable prognostic factor of survival in NSCLC patients treated with ICIs.© 2019 The Authors.

Nivolumab is the first   inhibitor approved for the second-line treatment of non-small  lung cancer (NSCLC) in China, and it significantly prolongs overall survival. However, considering the high cost of nivolumab, it is urgent to assess its value in China in terms of both efficacy and cost. The objective of this study was to investigate the cost-effectiveness of nivolumab vs docetaxel in the second-line setting for NSCLC patients from the Chinese healthcare system perspective.A Markov model consisting of three health states, was designed to evaluate the lifetime cost and effectiveness of nivolumab vs docetaxel in the second-line treatment of NSCLC patients. Clinical data was derived from the CheckMate 078 phase III clinical trial, which included 504 patients predominantly from China. Parametric survival models to fit and extrapolate survival data were chosen based on clinical rationality, visual fit and statistical goodness-of-fit. Lifetime costs and health outcomes were calculated, and US$28,899 and $63,564 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) were selected as the willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold values for general regions and affluent regions, respectively. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses were undertaken to explore the robustness of the model. Additional subgroup analyses were performed.In base case analysis, Nivolumab yielded an additional 0.24 QALYs, at a cost of $93,307 per QALY. Sensitivity analyses suggested that the results to be most sensitive to the price of nivolumab per kg (mean $60.00; range $26.00-$60.00) and the mean patient weight (65 kg, range 52-78 kg). Utility values in progression-free survival state (mean 0.804; range 0.643-0.965) and overall survival hazard ratio (0.68; 97.7% CI 0.52-0.90) had moderate impact on the model results. Subgroup analyses indicated that nivolumab was most cost-effective for patients who were 65 years of age or older ($85,171/QALY), followed by female patients ($85,273/QALY) and patients with tumor PD-L1 expression at least 1% ($90,309/QALY).Nivolumab is unlikely to be cost-effective compared with docetaxel for patients with previously treated advanced NSCLC in China. Ensuring that nivolumab is included in the National Reimbursement Drug List (NRDL) may be a valid mean of meeting extensive treatment demands in China.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31653079>Neurological  Related Adverse Events Associated with Nivolumab, Ipilimumab, and Pembrolizumab Therapy-Review of the Literature and Future Outlook.</a></h1><p>  inhibitor (ICI) therapy has revolutionized the management of various cancers with previously poor prognosis. Despite its great efficacy, the therapy is associated with a wide spectrum of -related adverse events (irAE) including neurological symptoms which can affect all parts of the central and peripheral nervous system. Even though these events are rare, they are of high relevance as the rate of residual symptoms or even fatal outcomes is remarkable. To provide a detailed overview of neurological adverse events associated with  -inhibitor therapy we conducted a literature search. While focusing on ipilimumab, nivolumab, and pembrolizumab therapy, all available case reports as well as larger case series and clinical trials have been considered. Eighty-two case reports about -inhibitor therapy induced symptoms of the peripheral nervous system have been published, while only 43 case reports addressed central nervous system abnormalities. The frequency of  -inhibitor therapy inducing neurological adverse events is about 1% in larger studies. Especially neuromuscular adverse events exhibit distinct clinical and diagnostic characteristics. Additionally, several affected patients presented with overlap-syndromes, which means that symptoms and diagnostic findings indicating myositis, myasthenia gravis, and neuropathy were present in one individual patient at the same time. Thus, neurological and particularly neuromuscular adverse events of  -inhibitor therapy may constitute a new disease entity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668206>Immunotherapy and Radiation: Charting a Path Forward Together.</a></h1><p>Preclinical studies combining immunotherapy and radiation therapy have suggested promising synergy, prompting translation into clinical trials. Radiation has been shown to significantly alter the tumor microenvironment, cause immunogenic  death, and potentiate anti-tumor  responses. Several radiation parameters may modulate these effects. Clinical data to date have suggested that combination therapy is largely well tolerated, but additional study is warranted to better estimate both short-term and long-term risks of combination treatment and extend these data to new immunotherapy agents.

The principle of action can be explained as "brake theory". After releasing the brakes by ICIs, unprecedented systemic toxicities, even some refractory and fatal -related adverse effects (irAEs) may develop. In this article, we summarized the recommended treatments of grade 3-4 severe irAEs in the latest European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO), National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN)/American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) and Chinese Society of Clinical Oncology (CSCO) guidelines and consensus. We also performed a systemic review of case reports and reviews of irAEs up to May 20, 2019 in PubMed and Chinese journals. Successful applications of specific immunosuppressive drugs and stimulating factors beyond the above guidelines and consensus were supplemented and highlighted, including agents blocking interleukin 6 (IL-6), rituximab, anti-tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) monoclonal antibody (mAb), anti-integrin 4 mAb, Janus kinase inhibitors, thrombopoietin receptor agonists and antithymocyte globulin (ATG) etc. We put some concerns of using high-dose steroids for long-term, and emphasize the secondary infections, tumor progression, and unavailability of ICI re-challenge during steroid treatment. We propose the "De-escalation Therapy" principle for severe and refractory irAEs, and suggest that immunosuppressive drugs specifically targeting cytokines should be used as early as possible. Many irAEs in the era of immunotherapy are unprecedented compared with traditional chemotherapy and small-molecule targeted therapy, which is a big challenge to oncologists. Therefore, the establishment of multidisciplinary system is very important for the management of cancer patients.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660074>A tumor microenvironment responsive biodegradable CaCO/MnO- based nanoplatform for the enhanced photodynamic therapy and improved PD-L1 immunotherapy.</a></h1><p>The low efficiency of photodynamic therapy (PDT) is caused by tumor hypoxia and the adaptive  resistance/evasion of tumor cells, while the currently emerging   therapy restores the intrinsic  capacities but can't directly attack the tumor cells.  Herein we report an integrated nanoplatform that combines PDT with immunotherapy to enhance photodynamic therapeutic effects and simultaneously inhibit tumor cells resistance/evasion. To achieve this, we fabricated Mn@CaCO/ICG nanoparticles and loaded them with PD-L1-targeting siRNA.  Thanks to the protection of CaCO on the loaded ICG and the oxygen produced by MnO, an enhanced photodynamic therapeutic effect  was observed.  experiments demonstrated that the nanoplatform could efficiently deliver the loaded drug to the tumor tissues and significantly improve tumor hypoxia, which further contributes to the therapeutic effect of PDT . Moreover, the synergistic benefits derived from the siRNA, which silenced the  gene PD-L1 that mediates the  resistance/evasion, resulted in a surprising therapeutic effect to rouse the  system.  The combination treatment strategy has great potential to be developed as a new and robust method for enhanced PDT therapy with high efficiency and a powerful antitumor  response based on PD-L1 blockade.© The author(s).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657633>Reconsidering the Optimal  Response to .</a></h1><p>Tuberculosis is unfortunately once again killing more people than any other infection.

The authors propose that reconsidering concepts of the optimal host  response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis is required to develop a paradigm that will inform novel interventions. The development of active tuberculosis associated with cancer treatment by   inhibition highlights that merely driving a stronger  response may not improve control of the pathogen. Here, we present different models of the host-pathogen interaction that are consistent with the complexity of human infection. We consider both the protective and harmful components of the  response in tuberculosis and develop a multiparameter framework that predicts disease risk. This novel conceptual model is important to inform emerging interventions to improve outcomes in tuberculosis by defining the ideal host response to target.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31680143>Immunogenicity of influenza vaccination in patients with cancer receiving   inhibitor.</a></h1><p>Among prospectively enrolled adult patients with cancer receiving   inhibitors (ICIs, n=46) or cytotoxic agents (n=90), seroprotection and seroconversion rates after seasonal quadrivalent influenza vaccinations were higher with ICI than with cytotoxic chemotherapy.

BRAF/MEK inhibition (BRAF/MEKi), single agent anti-PD-1 (aPD-1) antibodies and combination   inhibition with nivolumab and ipilimumab (niv/ipi) are all approved; however, they have not been prospectively compared. Therefore, we sought to compare overall survival of patients with advanced BRAF mutant melanoma treated with either front-line BRAF/MEKi, aPD-1, or niv/ipi.Patients with advanced BRAF mutant melanoma who had received BRAF/MEKi, niv/ipi, or aPD-1 in the front-line setting were identified from a nationwide database comprising de-identified patient-level structured and unstructured data derived from electronic health records. Survival was compared using Kaplan-Meier curves and log-rank analysis. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression models were used to measure the effect of front-line treatment, age (>64 or not), LDH (elevated or not), and Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (>1 or not) on survival.Five hundred and sixty seven patients with advanced disease and treated with front-line aPD-1 (n = 162), BRAF/MEKi (n = 297) or niv/ipi (n = 108) were identified. With a median follow-up of 22.4 months, median overall survival (OS) for patients treated with front-line niv/ipi was not reached (NR) while median OS for patients treated with aPD-1 or BRAF/MEKi was 39.5 months and 13.2 months, respectively. Front-line treatment with PD-1 and niv/ipi were associated with statistically longer survival than BRAF/MEKi in multivariate analyses.In our real-world retrospective analysis, patients with advanced BRAF mutant melanoma treated with front-line niv/ipi or aPD-1 had longer survival compared to those treated with front-line BRAF/MEKi.© 2019 The Authors.

Immunotherapeutical agents represent an emerging option for breast cancer treatment, including the human epidermal growth factor 2 positive (HER2+) subtype. The  system holds the ability to spontaneously implement a defensive response against HER2+ BC cells through complex mechanisms which can be exploited to modulate this response for obtaining a clinical benefit. Initial  system modulating strategies consisted mostly in vaccine therapies, which are still being investigated and improved. However, the entrance of trastuzumab into the scenery of HER2+ BC treatment was the real game changing event, which embodied a dominant -mediated mechanism. More recently, the advent of the   inhibitors has caused a new paradigm shift for immuno-oncology, with promising initial results also for HER2+ BC. Breast cancer has been traditionally considered poorly immunogenic, being characterized by relatively low tumor mutation burden (TMB). Nevertheless, recent evidence has revealed high tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and programmed  death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression in a considerable proportion of HER2+ BC patients. This may translate into a higher potential to elicit anti-cancer response and, therefore, wider possibilities for the use and implementation of immunotherapy in this subset of BC patients. We are herein presenting and critically discussing the most representative evidence concerning immunotherapy in HER2+ BC cancer, both singularly and in combination with therapeutic agents acting throughout HER2-block,   inhibition and anti-cancer vaccines.

Growing preclinical data show that combining vaccines and   inhibitors (ICIs) can prime intensified immunogenicity and modulate immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Herein, we focus on the safety and efficacy of approved and promising cancer vaccines alone or combined with ICIs in the treatment of several malignancies. Generally, the majority of clinical trials support the concept of synergy that combination therapy of vaccines and ICIs holds maximized potential to improve clinical outcomes. Importantly, the combination has acceptable safety and minimal additional toxicity compared with single-agent vaccines or ICIs. Additionally, the potential strategies of combining personalized tumor vaccines with ICIs will become priority option and future direction of vaccine development and application and the urgent need to develop effective biomarkers to screen appropriate patient populations and predict response to combination therapy.Copyright © 2019 Zhao, Chen, Ding and Liu.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655421>Lymphocytic ganglionitis leading to megacolon in lymphocyte-rich glioblastoma.</a></h1><p>T-  attack of cancer cells underlies the efficacy of   inhibitors in many cancer subtypes, but is not yet well established in the primary brain cancer glioblastoma.   inhibitor treatments that disinhibit the  system to enhance  clearance of cancer have in rare cases resulted in T- attack of peripheral ganglia causing lymphocytic ganglionitis. In glioblastoma, lymphocytic ganglionitis has not been reported and  inhibitors are not routinely used. Here we report a case of glioblastoma not treated with  inhibitors in which the primary tumor and peripheral ganglia of the celiac and sympathetic chains, as well as myenteric plexus, are infiltrated by CD8 cytotoxic T-cells. In addition to the marked lymphocytic infiltrates, this case is also notable for an unusually long survival (8 years) after diagnosis with glioblastoma, but an ultimately fatal outcome due to ileus. The findings suggest T-  attack of glioblastoma may prolong survival, but also suggest T- autoimmune diseases such as lymphocytic ganglionitis could become a risk with the future use of -targeted therapies for glioblastoma.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Targeted radionuclide therapy (TRT) is a branch of radiotherapy concerned with the use of radioisotopes, radiolabeled molecules or nanoparticles that deliver particulate radiation to cancer cells. TRT is a promising approach in cases of metastatic disease where conventional treatments are no longer effective. The increasing use of TRT raises the question of how to best integrate TRT with immunotherapy. In this study, we proposed a novel therapeutic regimen that combined programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1)-based immunotherapy with peptide-based TRT (Lu as the radionuclide) in the murine colon cancer model.To explore the most appropriate timing of immunotherapy after radionuclide therapy, the anti-PD-L1 antibody (αPD-L1 mAb) was delivered in a concurrent or sequential manner when Lu TRT was given.The results demonstrated that TRT led to an acute increase in PD-L1 expression on T cells, and TRT in combination with αPD-L1 mAb stimulated the infiltration of CD8 T cells, which improved local tumor control, overall survival and protection against tumor rechallenge. Moreover, our data revealed that the time window for this combination therapy may be critical to outcome.This therapeutic combination may be a promising approach to treating metastatic tumors in which TRT can be used. Clinical translation of the result would suggest that concurrent rather than sequential blockade of the PD-1/PD-L1 axis combined with TRT improves overall survival and long-term tumor control.© The author(s).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671581>Overview of   Inhibitors Therapy for Hepatocellular Carcinoma, and The ITA.LI.CA Cohort Derived Estimate of Amenability Rate to   Inhibitors in Clinical Practice.</a></h1><p>Despite progress in our understanding of the biology of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), this tumour remains difficult-to-cure for several reasons, starting from the particular disease environment where it arises-advanced chronic liver disease-to its heterogeneous clinical and biological behaviour. The advent, and good results, of immunotherapy for cancer called for the evaluation of its potential application also in HCC, where there is evidence of intra-hepatic  response activation. Several studies advanced our knowledge of   expression in HCC, thus suggesting that   blockade may have a strong rationale even in the treatment of HCC. According to this background, initial studies with tremelimumab, a cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) inhibitor, and nivolumab, a programmed  death protein 1 (PD-1) antibody, showed promising results, and further studies exploring the effects of other   inhibitors, alone or with other drugs, are currently underway. However, we are still far from the identification of the correct setting, and sequence, where these drugs might be used in clinical practice, and their actual applicability in real-life is unknown. This review focuses on HCC immunobiology and on the potential of   blockade therapy for this tumour, with a critical evaluation of the available trials on   blocking antibodies treatment for HCC.

Combination anti-CTLA4 and anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapies were investigated, and after demonstrating improved responses, rapidly gained approval. Certain tumor types previously considered non-immunogenic also demonstrated durable responses which has been a remarkable discovery. However, not all tumor types respond to immunotherapies and it is widely recognized that tumor-specific  inflammatory status predicts the best responders.

Until recently, beclin-1 was a protein known mainly for its role as a critical regulator of autophagy. In this issue of the JCI, Tan et al. describe the effects of the beclin-1 conditional myeloid -specific deletion in mice, in which immunostimulation resulted in hypersensitive neutrophils. The chronic proinflammatory effect of these neutrophils triggered spontaneous B  malignancies to develop. Such tumorigenic effects were mediated primarily by IL-21 and CD40 signaling, leading to the upregulation of tolerogenic molecules, such as IL-10 and PD-L1. The authors went on to examine samples derived from patient lymphoid malignancies and showed that beclin-1 expression in neutrophils positively correlated with pre-B  leukemia/lymphoma. Overall, the study provides an elegant model for neutrophil-driven carcinogenesis and identifies potential targets for immunotherapy of B  malignancies.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31650942>[The Use of Glucocorticoid in the Management of Adverse Effects Related to Immunocheckpoint Inhibitors].</a></h1><p>Immunocheckpoint inhibitors (ICIs) activated the patients' tumor immunity to kill the tumor , and brought new hope to patients with tumor.

Several studies have demonstrated the importance of JAK-STAT pathway components in regulating tumor initiation and metastatic progression, yet, the extent of how genetic alterations influence patient outcome is far from being understood.Focusing on 133 genes involved in JAK-STAT signaling, we investigated genomic, transcriptomic and clinical profiles of over 18,000 patients representing 21 diverse cancer types. We identified a core set of 28 putative gain- or loss-of-function JAK-STAT genes that correlated with survival outcomes using Cox proportional hazards regression and Kaplan-Meier analyses. Differential expression analyses between high- and low-expressing patient groups were performed to evaluate the consequences of JAK-STAT misexpression.We found that copy number alterations underpinning transcriptional dysregulation of JAK-STAT pathway genes differ within and between cancer types. Integrated analyses uniting genomic and transcriptomic datasets revealed a core set of JAK-STAT pathway genes that correlated with survival outcomes in brain, renal, lung and endometrial cancers. High JAK-STAT scores were associated with increased mortality rates in brain and renal cancers, but not in lung and endometrial cancers where hyperactive JAK-STAT signaling is a positive prognostic factor. Patients with aberrant JAK-STAT signaling demonstrated pan-cancer molecular features associated with misexpression of genes in other oncogenic pathways (Wnt, MAPK, TGF-β, PPAR and VEGF). Brain and renal tumors with hyperactive JAK-STAT signaling had increased regulatory T  gene (Treg) expression. A combined model uniting JAK-STAT and Tregs allowed further delineation of risk groups where patients with high JAK-STAT and Treg scores consistently performed the worst.Providing a pan-cancer perspective of clinically-relevant JAK-STAT alterations, this study could serve as a framework for future research investigating anti-tumor immunity using combination therapy involving JAK-STAT and   inhibitors.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31667679>Perforation of small intestinal metastasis of lung adenocarcinoma treated with pembrolizumab: a case report.</a></h1><p>Pembrolizumab is an   inhibitor and is an anti-human programmed  death-1 (PD-1) monoclonal antibody.

The treatment was stopped owing to drug-induced pneumonitis. One month after drug withdrawal, the patient visited the emergency department of our hospital with the complaint of severe stomachache. He had a rigid abdomen and generalized tenderness, and computed tomography scans showed free air within the abdomen. We diagnosed bowel perforation and performed emergency surgery. Surgical findings revealed multiple small intestine metastasis and mesenteric lymph node metastasis. Perforation was found in the metastatic site in the jejunum located around 40 cm anal to Treitz's ligament. This perforated part was resected, and functional end-to-end anastomosis was performed using linear staplers. The post-operative course was uneventful. Pathological examination revealed lung adenocarcinoma metastasis at the perforation site, and the effectiveness of pembrolizumab was grade 1b (Japanese Classification of the Colorectal Carcinoma, seventh edition).This is the first report of perforation of small intestinal metastasis of lung adenocarcinoma after pembrolizumab treatment.

Ligands provided by constituents of the tumour microenvironment engage receptors expressed by malignant T cells, promoting tumour growth and chemotherapy resistance. In addition to stimulatory receptors that promote the growth and survival of malignant T cells, recent studies suggest that homologous inhibitory receptors may have an opposing effect and function as tumour suppressors. For example, recent data suggest that programmed  death 1 blockade may lead to increased lymphoma growth. Therefore, the identification of alternative  receptors in T  lymphoproliferative neoplasms is an important and clinically relevant question.The  receptors T  immunoglobulin-3 (TIM-3), V-domain Ig-containing suppressor of T  activation (VISTA) and lymphocyte-activation gene 3 (LAG-3) play fundamental roles in peripheral tolerance, and their ligands are exploited by many solid tumours to evade host immunity. However, their expression in T  lymphoproliferative neoplasms has not been evaluated. In this study, we evaluated the expression of TIM-3, VISTA and LAG-3 in a cohort of peripheral T  lymphomas cases by immunohistochemistry and flow cytometric analysis.Our results demonstrate that TIM-3, VISTA and LAG-3 expression is rarely identified within a large cohort of T  lymphomas and its tumour microenvironment.Our data suggest that -regulatory roles for TIM-3, VISTA and LAG-3 may be predominant in lymphomas subsets different than the ones analysed in the current study. However, a potential role for these  receptors as tumour suppressors in T  lymphomas remains to be elucidated.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019. No commercial re-use.

Baseline clinical factors such as asthma may portend the development of pneumonitis due to pre-existing airway inflammation prior to immunotherapy.The purpose of the study was to investigate whether a prior diagnosis of asthma is associated with an increased risk of -related pneumonitis in patients undergoing cancer immunotherapy.Patients at the Moores Cancer Center at UC San Diego Health undergoing immunotherapy were identified on an IRB-approved protocol. Clinical charts were reviewed for asthma documented in the medical records and CT scans were reviewed during and after treatment. Pneumonitis was defined as the onset of new pulmonary symptoms with characteristic imaging findings during or after a patient's first course of immunotherapy that could not be readily explained as infection or a progression of malignancy. It was graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events.A total of 187 patients were included. A diagnosis of asthma was found in the records of 26 cases (13.9%). Pneumonitis was found in 10 cases (5.35%); 50% were grade 2 and 50% were grade 3-4. Two of the grade 3-4 cases (40%) occurred in patients with non-small- lung cancer. Three patients with asthma developed pneumonitis (11.5% of patients with asthma), all grade 3-4. Only 28.6% of the non-asthma-pneumonitis cases were grade 3-4. All (100%) of the asthma-pneumonitis patients were former smokers, while 71.4% of the non-asthma-pneumonitis patients were former smokers.A history of asthma may be associated with a higher grade of pneumonitis if it develops, and a history of smoking may augment this relationship.© 2019 S.

In this process, mutated antigenic peptides referred to as neoantigens often serve as the target on cancer cells that are recognized by the T  receptor (TCR) on endogenous T cells. Another successful immunotherapy has involved adoptive T  therapy, where therapeutic doses of T cells expressing a gene for an anti-cancer receptor are delivered to a patient. This approach has been used primarily against hematopoietic cancers using synthetic receptors called chimeric antigen receptors (CARs). CARs typically contain an antibody fragment (single-chain Fv, scFv) against a cancer  surface antigen such as the B  molecule CD19. While therapeutic CARs (and full antibodies) target antigens expressed on  surfaces, TCRs can target a much larger array of intracellular proteins by binding to any cellular peptide associated with an MHC product. These cancer targets include self-peptides from aberrantly expressed/overexpressed proteins or neoantigens. In this review, we discuss the use of TCRs in adoptive T  therapy and their target antigens. We focus on two properties that impact sensitivity, potency, and possible toxic cross-reactivity of TCR-mediated therapy: (1) the affinity of the TCR for the target antigen, and (2) the density of the target antigen. Finally, we provide a comprehensive listing of the current clinical trials that involve TCRs in adoptive T  cancer therapy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31682550>Efficacy of Pembrolizumab in Patients With Noncolorectal High Microsatellite Instability/Mismatch Repair-Deficient Cancer: Results From the Phase II KEYNOTE-158 Study.</a></h1><p>Genomes of tumors that are deficient in DNA mismatch repair (dMMR) have high microsatellite instability (MSI-H) and harbor hundreds to thousands of somatic mutations that encode potential neoantigens. Such tumors are therefore likely to be immunogenic, triggering upregulation of   proteins. Pembrolizumab, an anti‒programmed death-1 monoclonal antibody, has antitumor activity against MSI-H/dMMR cancer. We report data from the phase II KEYNOTE-158 study of pembrolizumab in patients with previously treated, advanced noncolorectal MSI-H/dMMR cancer.Eligible patients with histologically/cytologically confirmed MSI-H/dMMR advanced noncolorectal cancer who experienced failure with prior therapy received pembrolizumab 200 mg once every 3 weeks for 2 years or until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or patient withdrawal. Radiologic imaging was performed every 9 weeks for the first year of therapy and every 12 weeks thereafter. The primary end point was objective response rate per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1, as assessed by independent central radiologic review.Among 233 enrolled patients, 27 tumor types were represented, with endometrial, gastric, cholangiocarcinoma, and pancreatic cancers being the most common. Median follow up was 13.4 months. Objective response rate was 34.3% (95% CI, 28.3% to 40.8%). Median progression-free survival was 4.1 months (95% CI, 2.4 to 4.9 months) and median overall survival was 23.5 months (95% CI, 13.5 months to not reached). Treatment-related adverse events occurred in 151 patients (64.8%). Thirty-four patients (14.6%) had grade 3 to 5 treatment-related adverse events. Grade 5 pneumonia occurred in one patient; there were no other treatment-related fatal adverse events.Our study demonstrates the clinical benefit of anti-programmed death-1 therapy with pembrolizumab among patients with previously treated unresectable or metastatic MSI-H/dMMR noncolorectal cancer.

Effectiveness of   blockade in bladder adenocarcinoma is unknown due to lack of clinical trials. Due to the disease rarity, the rate of PD-L1 expression and DNA mismatch repair deficiency is largely unknown. In this study, we examined PD-L1 expression in 56 cases of bladder adenocarcinoma and mismatch repair protein expression in 42 cases of bladder adenocarcinoma using immunohistochemistry. Mismatch repair protein expression was uniformly intact in all cases of bladder adenocarcinoma, in comparison with 19% of advanced colorectal adenocarcinoma being mismatch repair deficient. This finding indicates that mismatch repair proteins may be combined with β-catenin and GATA-3 to create an immunostaining panel which, in addition to clinical studies, can aid in distinguishing bladder adenocarcinoma from secondary involvement by colorectal carcinoma. 4% of cases were found to overexpress PD-L1 in tumor cells while approximately a third of cases were found to display PD-L1 expression in tumor-infiltrating  cells. These results indicate hypermutators are likely rare in bladder adenocarcinoma, yet 20-30% of the patients may be eligible for   blockade therapy.Copyright © 2019.

This study was performed to characterize the histologic features of   inhibitor therapy associated gastritis.Gastric biopsies from patients on   inhibitor therapy with clinical suspicion of drug-associated gastrointestinal injury were identified. The predominant histological pattern of injury, distribution of injury, degree of tissue eosinophilia and prominence of apoptosis were recorded. Presenting symptoms, treatment and follow up data was obtained by medical chart review. The 12 patients included in the study group were treated with ipilimumab, nivolumab or pembrolizumab for a variety of tumors. Symptoms at presentation included nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. Chronic active gastritis with intraepithelial lymphocytosis and prominent apoptosis was seen in 8/12 patients and was the most useful combination for the diagnosis of drug-induced gastritis in these patients.

ICI therapies increase the activity of the  system and consequently can have autoimmune-like adverse effects that are often termed irAEs. irAE management can be challenging as irAEs can vary in their frequency and severity among patients, according to the specific agent, and can occur at any time during treatment or after therapy discontinuation. Additionally, for patients treated with ICI therapies in combination with other therapies, ICI-associated irAEs must be distinguished from adverse events associated with chemotherapy or targeted therapies, which often require different management. Pharmacists can provide essential support to diagnose and manage irAEs.Early and accurate diagnosis and prompt management of irAEs by pharmacists are critical to reduce the risk of severe or life-threatening complications and prevent premature ICI discontinuation.Pharmacists have a key role in the recognition, monitoring, and management of irAEs and in educating patients about irAEs associated with ICI therapies and the agents used to manage them.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31680346>A Multifunctional Cascade Bioreactor Based on Hollow-Structured Cu MoS for Synergetic Cancer Chemo-Dynamic Therapy/Starvation Therapy/Phototherapy/Immunotherapy with Remarkably Enhanced Efficacy.</a></h1><p>The unique tumor microenvironment (TME) facilitates cancer proliferation and metastasis, and it is hard to cure cancer completely via monotherapy. Herein, a multifunctional cascade bioreactor based on hollow mesoporous Cu MoS (CMS) loaded with glucose oxidase (GOx) is constructed for synergetic cancer therapy by chemo-dynamic therapy (CDT)/starvation therapy/phototherapy/immunotherapy. The CMS harboring multivalent elements (Cu , Mo ) exhibit Fenton-like, glutathione (GSH) peroxidase-like and catalase-like activity. Once internalized into the tumor, CMS could generate ·OH for CDT via Fenton-like reaction and deplete overexpressed GSH in TME to alleviate antioxidant capability of the tumors. Moreover, under hypoxia TME, the catalase-like CMS could react with endogenous H O to generate O for activating the catalyzed oxidation of glucose by GOx for starvation therapy accompanied with the regeneration of H O . The regenerated H O can devote to Fenton-like reaction for realizing GOx-catalysis-enhanced CDT. Meanwhile, the CMS under 1064 nm laser irradiation shows remarkable tumor-killing ability by phototherapy due to its excellent photothermal conversion efficiency (η = 63.3%) and cytotoxic superoxide anion (·O  ) generation performance. More importantly, the PEGylated CMS@GOx-based synergistic therapy combined with  blockade therapy could elicit robust  responses for both effectively ablating primary tumors and inhibiting cancer metastasis.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

In addition, the co-expression of its receptor in tumours has been demonstrated, mediating tumour  proliferation. Although CD70 expression is a prerequisite to enrol patients in solid tumour clinical trials using anti-CD70 immunotherapy, there is currently no standardised test to evaluate CD70 expression. These differences in immunohistochemistry (IHC) protocols make it challenging to compare the expression levels that were obtained in different studies, pointing out the need for one uniform methodology. In this retrospective study, over 600 tumour samples from different solid and haematological malignancies were analysed while using one validated IHC method. CD70 and CD27 expression was demonstrated in a broad range of tumour types. In solid tumours, 43% demonstrated CD70 positivity with the highest degree in renal  carcinoma (79.5%). Kaposi sarcoma showed no CD70 expression on the tumour cells. In lymphoma samples, 58% demonstrated CD70 positivity. Moreover, the co-expression of CD70 and CD27 was observed in 39% of lymphoma samples. These findings highlight the need to further explore anti-CD70 therapies in a broad range of CD70 expressing tumour types and in doing so, implementing one standardised protocol to define CD70 overexpression to use it as a diagnostic tool.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696097>Genetic Biomarkers For Hepatocellular Carcinoma In The Era Of Precision Medicine.</a></h1><p>Being one of the most lethal cancers that exhibit high levels of heterogeneity, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is associated with diverse oncogenic pathways underpinned by varied driver genes. HCC can be induced by different etiological factors including virus infection, toxin exposure or metabolic disorders. Consequently, patients may display varied genetic profiles, and may respond differently to the treatments involving inhibition of target pathways. These DNA/RNA mutations, copy number variations, chromatin structural changes, aberrant expression of non-coding RNAs and epigenetic modifications were considered as biomarkers in the application of precision medication. To explore how genetic testing could contribute to early diagnosis, prognosis, treatment and postoperative monitoring of HCC, we conducted a systematic review of genetic markers associated with different pathologies. Moreover, we summarized on-going clinical trials for HCC treatment, including the trials for multiple kinase inhibitors and   blockade (ICB). The efficacy of ICB treatment in HCC is not as good as what was observed in lung cancer and melanoma, which might be due to the heterogeneity of the microenvironment of the liver.© 2019 Duan et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31650946>[Management of Dermatologic Toxicities Related to   Inhibitors].</a></h1><p>  inhibitors (ICIs) represent a major breakthrough in cancer therapy. -related adverse events (irAEs) may occur during treatment due to their unique mechanism of action.

Antigen-specific CD8+ T cells are crucial for the rejection of established tumors. We constructed XCL1-GPC3 fusion molecules as a liver cancer vaccine by linking the XCL1 chemokine to glypican-3 (GPC3), which is overexpressed in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Cells expressing XCL1-GPC3 chemoattracted murine XCR1+CD8α+DCs and human XCR1+CD141+DCs in vitro and promoted their IL-12 production. After subcutaneous mXcl1-GPC3 plasmid injection, mXCL1-GPC3 was mainly detected in CD8α+DCs of mouse draining lymph nodes. XCL1-GPC3-targeted DCs enhanced antigen-specific CD8+ T -proliferation and induced the de novo generation of GPC3-specific CD8+ T cells, which abolished GPC3-expressing tumor cells in mouse and human systems. We immunized a murine autochthonous liver cancer model, with a hepatitis B background, with the mXcl1-GPC3 plasmid starting six weeks, when malignant hepatocyte clusters formed, or 14 weeks, when liver tumor nodules developed, after diethylnitrosamine administration. mXcl1-GPC3 immunized mice displayed significantly inhibited tumor formation and growth compared to GPC3-immunized mice. After mXcl1-GPC3 immunization, mouse livers showed elevated production of IFNγ, granzyme B, IL-18, CCL5, CXCL19, Xcl1, and increased infiltration of GPC3-specific CD8+ T cells, activated NK cells and NKT cells. The antitumor effects of these  cells were further enhanced by the administration of anti-PD1. Anti-HCC effects induced by hXCL1-GPC3 were confirmed in HCC-PDX model from three patients.

The advent of  blockade immunotherapy over the past few years represents a paradigm shift in cancer therapy. However, the prevalence of severe -related adverse events with CTLA-4 and PD1 pathway blockade in clinical studies especially in combination therapy groups, is a cause for concern. Immunotherapies with cytokines have also been extensively explored but they have been associated with adverse events in clinical trials. Oncolytic vectors engineered to express  blockade antibodies and cytokines could provide an avenue for reducing the clinical toxicity associated with systemic therapy by concentrating the immunomodulatory payload at the site of disease. In this study, we engineered six different recombinant viruses, NDVs expressing  inhibitors (rNDV-anti-PD1 and rNDV-anti-PDL1), superagonists (rNDV-anti-CD28) and immunocytokines, where these antibodies are fused to an immunostimulatory cytokine such as IL12 (rNDV-anti-CD28-mIL12, rNDV-anti-PD1-mIL12 and rNDV-anti-PDL1-mIL12). These six engineered viruses induced tumor control and survival benefit both in a highly aggressive unilateral and bilateral B16-F10 murine melanoma model, indicative of an abscopal effect. The data represent a strong proof-of-concept, on which further clinical evaluation could build.  inhibitor therapy has shown tremendous efficacy but also frequent and often severe side effects-especially when multiple drugs of this class are used simultaneously. Similarly, many investigational immunotherapy agents, which have shown promise in animal models, have failed in clinical trials due to dose-limiting toxicity when administered systemically. This study utilized a murine melanoma model to evaluate the efficacy of intratumoral injections of recombinant NDVs engineered to express multiple immunotherapeutic proteins with well-documented side effects in humans. Our results indicate that intratumoral administration of these recombinant NDVs, particularly when combined with systemic CTLA4  inhibition, exerts a robust effect in treated and non-treated tumors indicative of a systemic anti-tumoral response. The intratumoral delivery of rNDVs expressing immunotherapeutic proteins may be an effective method of targeting   populations most relevant for anti-tumoral immunity and allowing to restrict the use of systemic immunotherapy agents.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31674166>Tumor  Response and Immunotherapy in Gastric Cancer.</a></h1><p>The remarkable development of immuno-oncology has changed the landscape of gastric cancer (GC) treatment.

Recent studies have shown that the Controlling Nutritional Status (CONUT) score, a novel nutritional index, can be useful for predicting the prognosis in some malignancies. However, its usefulness in predicting the clinical outcome of - inhibitor (ICI) treatment in patients with NSCLC has not been clarified. The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical significance of the CONUT score in NSCLC patients treated with pembrolizumab.We conducted a retrospective analysis of the clinical data of 32 patients with advanced NSCLC who received pembrolizumab monotherapy. A cut-off CONUT score of 2 was used to categorize patients into low and high CONUT groups. We evaluated the relation between the clinicopathological factors including CONUT score and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and the prognosis.Twenty-two patients were classified into the low CONUT score group, while 10 were classified into the high CONUT score group. In the univariate and multivariate analyses, the number of prior treatments and the CONUT score were found to independently predict progression-free survival (PFS) (P<0.05), while the CONUT score as well as NLR was an independent prognostic factor for overall survival (P<0.05). In addition, in patients who received pembrolizumab as a first-line treatment, a high CONUT score was associated with a significantly worse PFS and overall survival in comparison to a low CONUT score.The CONUT score has potential application as a predictor of the therapeutic effect and the prognosis of NSCLC patients treated with pembrolizumab. Our findings suggest that in addition to the programmed  death ligand 1 expression level, the CONUT may also be a useful indicator for selecting NSCLC patients who may benefit from ICI treatment.2019 Journal of Thoracic Disease.

In contrast, tumor cells highly express PD-L1, which binds to receptor PD-1 expressed on activated T cells, leading to  escape. Anti-PD-1/PD-L1   therapy blocks the binding of PD-1/PD-L1 to reinvigorate the exhausted T cells, thereby inhibiting tumor growth. Exosomes are biologically active lipid-bilayer nanovesicles secreted by various  types that mediate intercellular signal communication. Numerous studies have shown that tumor cells are able to promote tumor epithelial-mesenchymal transition, angiogenesis, and  escape by releasing exosomes. Recent studies imply that tumor-derived exosomes could carry PD-L1 in the same membrane topology as the  surface, thereby resisting   therapy. In this review, we mainly discuss the role of exosomes in the regulation of tumor progression and the potential resistance mechanism to immunotherapy via exosomal PD-L1. In addition, we propose that exosomal PD-L1 may have the potential to be a target to overcome resistance to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibody therapy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671550>Immunotherapies and Future Combination Strategies for Head and Neck Squamous  Carcinoma.</a></h1><p>Head and neck squamous  carcinoma (HNSCC) is often diagnosed at an advanced stage and has a dismal prognosis.

In contrast to T cells, NK cells elicit rapid anti-tumor responses based on signals from activating and inhibitory  surface receptors. They also lyse target cells via antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, a critical mode of action of several therapeutic antibodies used to treat cancer. A body of evidence shows that NK cells can exhibit potent anti-tumor activity against chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), acute myeloid leukemia (AML), and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). However, disease-associated mechanisms often restrain the proper functions of endogenous NK cells, leading to inadequate tumor control and risk for disease progression. Although allogeneic NK cells can prevent leukemia relapse in certain settings of stem  transplantation, not all patients are eligible for this type of therapy. Moreover, remissions induced by adoptively infused NK cells are only transient and require subsequent therapy to maintain durable responses. Hence, new strategies are needed to trigger full and durable anti-leukemia responses by NK cells in patients with myeloid malignancies. To achieve this, we need to better understand the interplay between the malignant cells, their microenvironment, and the NK cells. This review focuses on mechanisms that are involved in suppressing NK cells in patients with myeloid leukemia and MDS, and means to restore their full anti-tumor potential. It also discusses novel molecular targets and approaches, such as bi- and tri-specific antibodies and   inhibitors, to redirect and/or unleash the NK cells against the leukemic cells.Copyright © 2019 Carlsten and Järås.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31647155>Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neurotoxicity: A multifaceted, still unsolved issue.</a></h1><p>Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neurotoxicity (CIPN) is a potentially dose-limiting side effect of several commonly used cytotoxic chemotherapy agents.

In this special issue, the multifaceted profile of CIPN will be presented, with particular emphasis on bolstering the need to develop more optimized outcome measures than the existing ones to accurately evaluate the extent of CIPN, but also to ascertain the differences in the incidence, risk factors, clinical phenotype, and management of CIPN, according to the most commonly used neurotoxic chemotherapy classes. Perspectives for future research to pursue in order to cover the gaps in knowledge in the CIPN field will also be discussed.© 2019 Peripheral Nerve Society.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669518>PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors in oesophago-gastric cancers.</a></h1><p>Oesophago-gastric cancers (OGCs) are aggressive tumours. While better peri-operative strategies, increased number of cytotoxic agents and availability of targeted therapies have improved survival, there remains an unmet need for novel treatment approaches.   inhibitors (ICIs) have marked a new era in cancer management with unprecedented results in several malignancies. Although OGC lagged behind other solid tumours, evidence has increasingly accumulated supporting the contention that modulation of the anti-cancer host  response may be beneficial for at least some patients. Many trials have been completed in Eastern and Western countries, some of these leading to the approval of ICIs in the refractory setting, and favorable opinion from regulatory agencies is expected also in treatment-naïve, advanced OGC. Furthermore, studies are evaluating ICIs in the early stage setting and exploring the potential of combination treatments. In this article we discuss the biological bases underlying the successful development of ICIs in OGC and review the available data on PD-1 and PD-L1 monoclonal antibodies in this disease. Also, we present ongoing clinical trials of these ICIs that could shape the future treatment landscape of OGC.Copyright © 2019.

Animal models to optimize such immunotherapeutics comprise an important strategy but often fail to predict the efficacy of clinical approaches. To address this, we aimed to establish new mouse models. In this study, we found that the expression of PD-L1was present at the beginning stage but a gradual decline over time in the in vitro  culture and also in the mouse model. Based upon this finding, we established the IFN-γ-(human peripheral blood mononuclear ) PBMC-CDX ( line-derived xenograft) and IFN-γ-PBMC-PDX (patient-derived xenograft) mouse models, which recapitulate human tumor and human  system interactions. IFN-γ was injected peritumorally to maintain the positivity of PD-L1 in the tumor microenvironment. Under this circumstance, the PD-1 molecule on the human T lymphocyte surface is in contact with the PD-L1 molecule on the human tumor cells and, thus, the formatin of the PD-L1/PD-1 pathway in the tumor microenvironment.Treatment with anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) significantly inhibited the growth of both CDX and PDX tumors, but not non-human NCG models (without allogeneic human PBMCs and IFN-γ) . These experimental data provide an important and promising platform for the development of drugs and the evaluation of the drug efficacy of immunotherapies with anti-PD-1 mAb as well as the basis of preclinical mAb drug research.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31650951>[Recommendation of Diagnosis and Management for the Infections Related to   Inhibitors].</a></h1><p>  inhibitors (ICIs) have been widely used in management of malignant tumor. Programmed death ligand 1 (PD-1)/programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitors have been introduced to treat non-small  lung cancer (NSCLC) in recent years. Currently, PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors are considered to have minor side effects and do not independently increase the risk of infection. However, they may cause -related adverse events (irAEs) that can require immunosuppressive therapy with corticosteroids and/or immunosuppressants, leading to opportunistic infections. Furthermore, there were reports about reactivation of chronic/latent infections without irAEs. Thus,   inhibitor related infections have drawn more and more attention in the world. In this paper, we described the potential mechanism, available clinical data and recommendation of diagnosis and management for PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor related infections.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31650945>[Clinical Diagnosis and Treatment Recommendations for Adverse Reaction in the Nervous System Related to Immunocheckpoint Inhibitor].</a></h1><p>  inhibitors (ICIs) can cause adverse reactions in the nervous system, with the incidence rate ranging from 0.1% to 12%, and 80% occurring within the first 4 months of ICI application. It can cause lesions in various parts of the nervous system, including aseptic meningitis, meningoencephalitis, necrotizing encephalitis, brainstem encephalitis, transverse myelitis and other central nervous system diseases. It can also cause cranial peripheral neuropathy, multifocal radicular neuropathy, Guillain-Barre syndrome, spinal radicular neuropathy and myasthenia gravis, myopathy, etc. For these complications of the nervous system, diagnosis could be made by sufficient collection of disease manifestations combined with imaging, cerebrospinal fluid examinations, electro-encephalogram or electro myography to exclude infection or tumor progression. In the treatment of severe cases, ICIs should be discontinued and treated with high doses of glucocorticoid or gamma globulin with systemic support. After neurological adverse reactions, the prognosis of severe cases is poor.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649958>Role of Regulatory T  and Effector T  Exhaustion in Liver-Mediated Transgene Tolerance in Muscle.</a></h1><p>The pro-tolerogenic environment of the liver makes this tissue an ideal target for gene replacement strategies. In other peripheral tissues such as the skeletal muscle, anti-transgene  response can result in partial or complete clearance of the transduced fibers. Here, we characterized liver-induced transgene tolerance after simultaneous transduction of liver and muscle. A clinically relevant transgene, α-sarcoglycan, mutated in limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2D, was fused with the SIINFEKL epitope (hSGCA-SIIN) and expressed with adeno-associated virus vectors (AAV-hSGCA-SIIN). Intramuscular delivery of AAV-hSGCA-SIIN resulted in a strong inflammatory response, which could be prevented and reversed by concomitant liver expression of the same antigen. Regulatory T cells and upregulation of  inhibitor receptors were required to establish and maintain liver-mediated peripheral tolerance. This study identifies the fundamental role of the synergy between Tregs and upregulation of  inhibitor receptors in the liver-mediated control of anti-transgene immunity triggered by muscle-directed gene transfer.© 2019 The Author(s).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656652>Impact of clinicopathological features on the efficacy of   inhibitors plus conventional treatment in patients with advanced lung cancer.</a></h1><p>To investigate the impact of different   inhibitors (ICI), programmed-death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression and clinical characteristics on clinical outcome of ICI plus conventional treatment in advanced lung cancer patients.Randomized clinical trials that compared combination therapy versus control group were screened in PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, Cochrane Library and included. The pooled hazard ratio (HR) with a 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were used to estimate associations. Cochrane Collaboration tool was used for quality assessment.Thirteen clinical trials were included (n=9,241). The pooled results indicated that combination strategy based on ICI significantly improved PFS (HR =0.66, P<0.001) and OS (HR =0.77, P<0.001) in overall population. Greatest PFS improvement was seen in group of PD-1 based combination (HR =0.54, P<0.001), followed by PD-L1 based (HR =0.66, P<0.001) and CTLA-4 based combination (HR =0.86, P=0.002) (interaction: P<0.001).The improvement in PFS did proportionally differ by PD-L1 expression (interaction: P<0.001). OS HRs favored combination in patients with negative or strong positive group of PD-L1 expression not in the group of weak positive group (HR =0.77, P=0.12). Subgroup analysis demonstrated that OS benefit could be observed in male (HR =0.82, P=0.03), current or former smokers (HR =0.74, P=0.04), non-squamous (HR =0.71, P<0.001) and patients without driver mutations (HR =0.73, P<0.001). OS benefit rather than PFS benefit was appeared in patients with liver metastasis treated with ICI-based combination (HR =0.74, P=0.005).ICI plus conventional treatment could significantly improve PFS and OS in overall advanced lung cancer patients. PD-1-based combination leads to the greatest improvement in both PFS and OS. More data are warranted to address the association of PD-L1 staining intensity with OS improvement. Male, current or former smokers, non-squamous and patients without driver mutations do benefit from ICI-based combination.2019 Journal of Thoracic Disease.

Currently, however, the effect is not universal, with objective response rates (ORR) of about 15-25%, and even lower for some cancers. Abnormal vasculature is a hallmark of most solid tumors and plays a role in  evasion. Growing body of evidence suggests that vascular normalization and  reprogramming could operate synergistic effect, resulting in an enhanced therapeutic efficacy. However, the benefit of antitumor efficacy must be weighed against the risk of added toxicity. In this systematic review, we summarize severe toxicity observed in such a kind of combination regimen.  PubMed and Embase were searched for English references published up to May 31, 2019, with MeSH and keywords search terms of   inhibitors (ICIs) and antiangiogenic agents approved for using in solid tumors. Studies performing concomitant use of ICIs and antiangiogenic agents, and also reporting severe treatment-related adverse events (trAEs) (≥grade 3), were included for further analysis.  A total of 32 studies including a total of 2,324 participants were analyzed. Limited available data suggests that both antiangiogenic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) show potential risk of increasing treatment-related toxicity when combined with ICIs. Overall, the total incidence of severe adverse events (AEs) associated with ICIs plus mAbs (44.5%) is lower than that of ICIs plus TKIs (60.1%). However, the trAEs observed in combination therapy are mostly consistent with the known safety profiles of corresponding monotherapy, and they seem to be largely related to antiangiogenic agents, rather than a true -related adverse event (irAE) predominantly due to ICIs. The majority of trAEs are intervened by holding ICI treatment and adding corticosteroids, as well as reducing dose or adjusting administration frequency of the antiangiogenic drugs.  Concurrent use of ICIs and antiangiogenic agents shows potential treatment-related toxicity. Further research is required to compare the efficacy and safety of the combination regimen and corresponding monotherapy and identify predictive biomarkers, as well as explore dose, duration, and sequencing schedules of drugs.Copyright © 2019 Gao, Yang, Yi and Zhu.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669893>Something old, something new: liver injury associated with Total parenteral nutrition therapy and   inhibitors.</a></h1><p>Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is a challenging and constantly changing field. The pathologist plays a key role in interpreting liver biopsies by classifying the pattern of injury, grading the severity of injury, and evaluating for other possible causes. Reports of iatrogenic liver injury are reviewed here with a focus on total parenteral nutrition (TPN) [i.e., intestinal failure-associated liver disease (IFALD)] and   inhibitors (ICIs). The hallmark features of IFALD are cholestasis and steatosis. Cholestasis is more common in infants whereas steatosis and steatohepatitis are more commonly seen in older children and adults. Infants tend to have a faster progression to fibrosis and cirrhosis. Perivenular fibrosis and ductopenia may also be seen in IFALD. Although fish oil-based lipid emulsions can reverse cholestasis, recent studies have shown persistent or progressive fibrosis. ICI-induced liver injury usually presents as an acute hepatitis with features similar to those seen in idiopathic autoimmune hepatitis and drug-induced autoimmune hepatitis. However, it lacks a prominent plasma  infiltrate and serological markers of autoimmune hepatitis. Other features such as fibrin ring granulomas and cholangitis have also been reported in association with ICIs. Treatment for ICI-induced liver injury includes corticosteroids and other immunosuppressants.Copyright © 2019.

By virtue of their targets and mechanisms of action, ICIs can cause autoimmune and inflammatory effects, termed -related adverse events (irAEs). Unlike traditional therapies, irAEs are latent and unstable. Severe adverse reactions will force patients to discontinue treatment and even affect their survival. Therefore, with the wide application of ICIs in clinical practice, clinicians need to fully understand the possible adverse reactions of such drugs and appropriate treatment strategies, in order to improve the survival rate and treatment effect of patients receiving ICIs. In this article, we review the incidence, clinical features, diagnosis and treatment of -related endocrine events that may occur with administration of ICIs.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31653272>Immunogenicity of prostate cancer is augmented by BET bromodomain inhibition.</a></h1><p>Prostate cancer responds poorly to current immunotherapies. Epigenetic therapies such as BET Bromodomain inhibition can change the transcriptome of tumor cells, possibly making them more immunogenic and thus susceptible to  targeting.We characterized the effects of BET bromodomain inhibition using JQ1 on PD-L1 and HLA-ABC expression in two human prostate  lines, DU145 and PC3. RNA-Seq was performed to assess changes on a genome-wide level. A cytotoxic T  killing assay was performed in MC38-OVA cells treated with JQ1 to demonstrate increased immunogenicity. In vivo experiments in the Myc-Cap model were conducted to show the effects of JQ1 administration in concert with anti-CTLA-4  blockade.Here, we show that targeting BET bromodomains using the small molecule inhibitor JQ1 decreased PD-L1 expression and mitigated tumor progression in prostate cancer models. Mechanistically, BET bromodomain inhibition increased MHC I expression and increased the immunogenicity of tumor cells. Transcriptional profiling showed that BET bromodomain inhibition regulates distinct networks of antigen processing and   molecules. In murine models, treatment with JQ1 was additive with anti-CTLA-4 immunotherapy, resulting in an increased CD8/Treg ratio.BET Bromodomain inhibition can mediate changes in expression at a genome wide level in prostate cancer cells, resulting in an increased susceptibility to CD8 T  targeting. These data suggest that combining BET bromodomain inhibition with   blockade may have clinical activity in prostate cancer patients.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31651263>Publication statuses of clinical trials supporting FDA-approved   inhibitors: a meta-epidemiological investigation.</a></h1><p>The low data publication rate for Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs, and discrepancies between FDA-submitted versus published data, remain a concern. We investigated the publication statuses of sponsor-submitted clinical trials supporting recent anticancer drugs approved by the FDA, with a focus on   inhibitors (ICPis).We identified all ICPis approved between 2011 and 2014, thereby obtaining 3 years of follow-up data. We assessed the clinical trials performed for each drug indication and matched each trial with publications in the literature. The primary benchmark was the publication status 2 years post-approval. We examined the association between time to publication and drug type using a multilevel Cox regression model that was adjusted for clustering within drug indications and individual covariates.Between 2011 and 2014, 36 anticancer drugs including 3 ICPis were newly approved by the FDA. Of 19 trials investigating the 3 ICPis, 11 (58%) were published within 2 years post-approval. We randomly selected 10 of the 33 remaining anticancer drugs; 68 of 101 trials investigating these drugs (67%) were published. Overall, the publication rate was 66% at 2 years post-approval with a median time to publication of 2.3 years. There was no significant difference in the time to trial publication between ICPis and other anticancer drugs (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 1.1; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.8-1.7; P = 0.55). However, findings related to non-ICPis investigated specifically in randomized phase 2 or phase 3 trials were significantly more likely to be published earlier than those related to ICPis (adjusted HR, 7.4; 95% CI, 1.8-29.5; P = 0.005).One in 3 sponsor-submitted trials of the most recently approved anticancer drugs remained unpublished 2 years post-FDA approval.

Yet, the sensitive detection of multiple   from small volumes of liquid biopsy samples is challenging. In this study, we develop a multiplexed   biosensor (MICB) for parallel detection of soluble   PD-1, PD-L1, and LAG-3. MICB integrates a microfluidic sandwich immunoassay using engineered single chain variable fragments and alternating current electrohydrodynamic in situ nanofluidic mixing for promoting biosensor-target interaction and reducing non-specific non-target binding. MICB provides advantages of simultaneous analysis of up to 28 samples in <2 h, requires as little as a single sample drop (i.e., 20 μL) per target  , and applies high-affinity yeast -derived single chain variable fragments as a cost-effective alternative to monoclonal antibodies. We investigate the assay performance of MICB and demonstrate its capability for accurate   detection in simulated patient serum samples at clinically-relevant levels. MICB provides a dynamic range of 5 to 200 pg mL-1 for PD-1 and PD-L1, and 50 to 1000 pg mL-1 for LAG-3 with a coefficient of variation <13.8%. Sensitive   detection was achieved with limits of detection values of 5 pg mL-1 for PD-1, 5 pg mL-1 for PD-L1, and 50 pg mL-1 for LAG-3. The multiplexing capability, sensitivity, and relative assay simplicity of MICB make it capable of serving as a bioanalytical tool for   therapy monitoring.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31682239>Endogenous T cells prevent tumor  escape following adoptive T  therapy.</a></h1><p>While the outcome of adoptive T  therapy (ACT) is typically correlated with the functionality of the inoculated T cells, the role of the endogenous T cells is unknown. The success of  blockade therapy has demonstrated the potentially curative value of preexisting tumor-primed T cells in cancer treatment. Given the results from  blockade therapy, we hypothesized that endogenous T cells contribute to long-term survival following ACT. Here, we describe a therapeutic approach combining ACT with an oncolytic vaccine that allows simultaneous analysis of antitumor immunity mediated by transferred and endogenous T cells. We found that, in addition to promoting the expansion and tumor infiltration of the transferred T cells, oncolytic vaccines boosted tumor-primed host T cells. We determined that transferred T cells contributed to rapid destruction of large tumor masses while endogenous T cells concurrently prevented the emergence of antigen-loss variants. Moreover, while transferred T cells disappeared shortly after tumor regression, endogenous T cells secured long-term memory with a broad repertoire of antigen specificity. Our findings suggest that this combination strategy may exploit the full potential of ACT and tumor-primed host T cells to eliminate the primary tumor, prevent  escape, and provide long-term protective memory.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670092>Traf6 inhibitor boosts antitumor immunity by impeding regulatory T  migration in Hepa1-6 tumor model.</a></h1><p>Tumors escape  attacks via various mechanisms, among which activation of regulatory pathways in effector  cells and recruitment of immunosuppressive cells are usually employed. Traf6 is a member of the family of tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factors and involved in many signaling pathways. While it plays important roles in both tumor biology and  system, the potential therapeutic role of Traf6 in tumor immunotherapy hasn't ever been assessed. Here, we confirmed the anti-tumor effect of Traf6 inhibitor in Hepa1-6 tumor model. Flow cytometry-based analysis revealed that T -mediated antitumor immunity was provoked and the infiltration of Treg cells was restrained when treated with Traf6 inhibitor. Via an in vivo migration assay, we found that Traf6 inhibitor decreased the population of intratumor Tregs by impeding the migration of Tregs towards tumor. Finally, we demonstrated that combination of Traf6 inhibitor and PD-1 blockade could receive a better antitumor efficiency. These results implicated that Traf6 inhibitor could serve as a supplement for   therapy.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

However, it is only in recent years that research on NK  exhaustion and potential  impacting NK cells has become popular. NK cells, as the major player in innate immunity, are critical for  surveillance, particularly the control of metastasis and hematological cancers. The balance between activating and inhibitory signals fine tunes the activation and effector functions of NK cells, and transformed cells modulate NK cells by upregulating negative signaling that "exhausts" NK cells. Exhausted NK cells with excessive expression of inhibitory receptors ( molecules) are impaired in the recognition of tumor cells as well as antitumor cytotoxicity and cytokine secretion. Therefore, an understanding of the potential  molecules involved in NK  exhaustion is particularly important in terms of NK -targeted cancer immunotherapy. In this review, we summarize recent advances in NK   inhibitors and their progress in clinical trials. Moreover, we highlight some of the latest findings in fundamental NK  receptor biology and propose potential NK   molecules for future immunotherapeutic applications.Copyright © 2019 Sun and Sun.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31650949>[Clinical Diagnosis and Treatment Recommendations for Ocular Toxicities of Target Therapy and   Inhibitor Therapy].</a></h1><p>The increasing use of target therapy and immunocheckpoint inhibitors in cancers has brought new hope of survival to patients with advanced tumors.

Limited data is available about mechanisms of primary resistance. Data is lacking about mechanisms involved in acquired resistance or mixed responses in NSCLC. We aimed to identify mechanisms of resistance by studying biopsies taken from sites of secondary progression.We identified all cases of NSCLC that have received ICI for advanced disease in our institute. Of these cases, those that have demonstrated acquired resistance or mixed responses, and have underwent a biopsy from a progressive lesion were analyzed. Selected specimens were subjected to next-generation sequencing (NGS; Oncomine™ Solid Tumour Fusion Transcript Kit).Out of 664 lung cancer cases, 249 were NSCLC that have received ICI. Of these, eight cases matched our search criteria. Two of them demonstrated transformation to small  lung cancer (SCLC; 2/8, 25%). NGS verified a common origin to a matched pre-treatment NSCLC specimen and an on-treatment progressive SCLC specimen. In two cases no tumor cells were found and in the remaining four the pathology was similar to the initial biopsy. In one of the cases of SCLC transformation platinum-etoposide chemotherapy was administered, with short-term benefit only and further disease progression.Mechanisms of acquired resistance to ICI include SCLC transformation. Repeat biopsies of progressing lesions after initial response or in cases of mixed response can shed light on mechanisms of resistance.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

In advanced kidney cancer,  inhibitors have shown improved outcomes in first- and second-line settings compared with standard of care, but the role of patient gender on treatment outcome is unclear. We aimed to assess the efficacy of immunotherapy according to patient gender in advanced kidney cancer. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. A literature search was performed using PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and The Cochrane Library to identify eligible studies published through February 16, 2019. Studies were included if they reported on the differential outcomes of male and female patients with metastatic kidney cancer receiving immunotherapy. Our outcomes of interest were overall survival (OS) or progression-free survival (PFS). Four randomized controlled trials comprising a total of 3664 patients (2715 males and 949 females) met our inclusion criteria. Both men and women with metastatic kidney cancer had an OS and PFS advantage with immunotherapy compared with standard-of-care, but no statistically significant difference between the genders was observed (OS hazard ratio [HR] for men, 0.69; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.59-0.8; P = .40; HR for women, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.48-0.81; P = .13; PFS HR for men, 0.7; 95% CI, 0.59-0.82; P = .24; HR for women, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.52-0.90; P = .105).

HLA-G is exclusively expressed in the placenta, some immunoregulatory cells, and tumors and has several unique isoforms. However, the recognition of HLA-G isoforms by LILRs is poorly understood. In this study, we characterized LILR binding to the β2-microglobulin (β2m)-free HLA-G1 isoform, which is synthesized by placental trophoblast cells and tends to dimerize and multimerize. The multimerized β2m-free HLA-G1 dimer lacked detectable affinity for LILRB1, but bound strongly to LILRB2. We also determined the crystal structure of the LILRB1 and HLA-G1 complex, which adopted the typical structure of a classical HLA class I complex. LILRB1 exhibits flexible binding modes with the α3 domain, but maintains tight contacts with β2m, thus accounting for β2m-dependent binding. Notably, both LILRB1 and B2 are oriented at suitable angles to permit efficient signaling upon complex formation with HLA-G1 dimers. These structural and functional features of ligand recognition by LILRs provide novel insights into their important roles in the biological regulations.Copyright © 2019 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31676146>Lack of Lymphocyte Recovery After Esophagectomy Predicts Overall and Recurrence-Free Survival.</a></h1><p>Lymphocytes have become the target of cancer interventions through engineering or   antibodies. We previously found decreased lymphocyte counts to be a predictor of mortality and complications in trauma and cardiac surgery patients. We hypothesized lack of lymphocyte count recovery postoperatively would predict outcomes in esophagectomy patients.A retrospective review of all patients undergoing esophagectomy for adenocarcinoma performed over 13 y at our center by a single surgeon after institutional review board approval was performed. Patients were grouped by postoperative lymphocytes counts: never low, low with recovery, and low without recovery. Resolution of lymphopenia was assessed by day 4. Primary end points were overall and recurrence-free survival.In total, 198 patients were included with a minimum 6-mo follow-up. Collectively the 5-y recurrence and overall survival rates were 36% and 50%, respectively. Recurrence was significantly higher at 5 y in patients with persistent lymphopenia (43%) compared with those who recovered (14% P = 0.0017) and those who never dropped (0% P = 0.0009). The persistent lymphopenia group had significantly lower survival (45%) compared with the two other groups (67% P = 0.0232).There is a significant decrease in the overall and recurrence-free survival in those patients whose lymphocyte count drops without recovery after their esophagectomy.

Acidic extracellular pH is a major attribute of the tumor microenvironment (TME) that promotes  evasion and tumor progression. Therefore, antagonizing tumor acidity can be a powerful approach in cancer immunotherapy. Here, Pluronic F-127 is used as a NaHCO releasing carrier to focally alleviate extracellular tumor acidity. In a mouse tumor model, intratumoral treatment with pH modulating injectable gel (pH-MIG) generates -favorable TME, as evidenced by the decrease of -suppressive cells and increase of tumor infiltrating CD8+T cells. The combination of pH-MIG with   inhibitors, anti-PD-1 and anti-TIGIT antibodies, increases intratumoral T  function, which leads to tumor clearance. Mechanistically, extracellular acidity was shown to upregulate co-inhibitory   receptors and inhibit mTOR signaling pathways in memory CD8+T cells, which impaired effector functions. Furthermore, an acidic pH environment increased the expression and engagement of TIGIT and its ligand CD155, which suggested that the extracellular pH can regulate the suppressive function of TIGIT pathway. Collectively, these findings suggest that pH-MIG holds potential as a new TME modulator for effective   inhibitor therapies.Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Therefore, the majority of SIAC patients have limited chemotherapeutic options. Until recently, the development of novel and effective therapies for SIAC have been limited owing to the low number of samples that have been collected and the low incidence of SIAC. Immunotherapies are becoming a focus. However, in SIAC, only a few studies to identify immunotherapy-responsive subgroups and their prognostic indicators have been reported. In the present study, we categorise primary SIAC into four types of tumour  microenvironments and propose a strategy for identifying patient subgroups that are most likely to be immunotherapy-responsive. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue samples of a multicentre cohort of patients with SIAC (n=195) were collected using tissue microarrays. Immunohistochemical (IHC) stains for PD-L1, PD-1, and CD8 were performed, and microsatellite instability was evaluated using an IHC stain. Tumour microenvironment  type (TMIT) I [PD-L1-positive tumour cells and CD8-high tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs)] and TMIT III (PD-L1-positive tumour cells and CD8-low TILs) show the best and worse prognoses, respectively. PD-L1 expression was significantly associated with high microsatellite instability (MSI) status. CD8-high TILs were positively correlated with PD-1-high TILs and high MSI. The TMIT I subgroup demonstrated a more patent CD8/PD-L1/PD-1 signalling pathway compared to other TMITs. Therefore, the TMIT I subgroup can be expected to have an effective response to   inhibitor therapies in SIAC. Such classification of SIACs into four  types can be useful in predicting the prognosis of patients and the identification of immunotherapy-responsive subgroups.Copyright © 2019 Royal College of Pathologists of Australasia.

Intravenous (i.v.) injection of B16 melanoma cells (H-2K) leads to lethal disseminated pulmonary metastasis in Balb/c recipients (H-2K). This lack of  control is related to low major histocompatibility complex (MHC) expression on B16 cells which is associated with delayed and decreased anti-tumour adaptive  responses (e.g., alloantibody formation) as: (i) other tumour types with normal H-2K expression are rejected with concomitant antibody production; (ii) preincubation of B16 with IFN-gamma to upregulate H-2K expression resulted in improved antibody production and anti-tumour activity. The delayed/decreased anti-tumour adaptive  responses induced by B16 inoculation is not able to interrupt progression of primary metastases, while it is able to effectively eliminate secondary inoculated subcutaneously (s.c.) B16 cells from progression. This is due to the presence of an immunosuppressive TME within the primary metastases characterized by increased regulatory T cells (Tregs) and an increased T helper cells (Th) 2/1 profile. These tumour-induced immunosuppressive T  populations are counteracted by improved adaptive immunity via active and passive immunization, resulting in effective elimination of the TME, destruction of the metastatic tumour and a reversal of Th2/1 profile in a time-sensitive manner. Thus, we here demonstrate that the TME is not irreversible and adaptive immunity is able to eradicate established solid tumour and its immunosuppressive TME. This study will help design treatments to overcome the immunosuppressive effect of the TME and improve efficacy of cancer immunotherapy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31684111>The Lung  Prognostic Index Discriminates Survival Outcomes in Patients with Solid Tumors Treated with   Inhibitors.</a></h1><p>  inhibitors (ICI) have revolutionized the treatment landscape of several solid tumor types. However, as patient outcomes are heterogeneous, clinical tools to aid in prognostication are needed. The Lung  Prognostic Index (LIPI) correlates with outcomes in patients with non-small  lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with ICI, but its applicability beyond NSCLC is poorly defined. We sought to determine whether LIPI is associated with overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS) and objective response rate (ORR) in a pooled, real-world, retrospective cohort of patients with solid tumors treated with ICI. Of the total pooled cohort (N = 578), 47.2%, 38.2% and 14.5% of patients were stratified into good, intermediate and poor LIPI group, respectively. Median OS were 22.8 (95% CI 17.4-29.5), 7.8 (95% CI 6.6-9.6), and 2.5 months (95% CI 1.4-3.4) (p < 0.0001). Median PFS were 9.9 (95% CI 7.2-11.5), 3.6 (95% CI 2.7-4.3), and 1.4 months (95% CI 1.2-2.2) (p < 0.0001). ORR was also associated with LIPI group (p < 0.001). Intermediate and poor LIPI were independently prognostic of OS compared to good LIPI, with hazard ratios (HR) of 1.8 (95% CI 1.4-2.3, p < 0.001) and 3.6 (95% CI 2.5-5.1, p < 0.001), respectively. These data are the first to suggest that in a real-world setting, the prognostic value of LIPI may be tumor agnostic.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670091>Potential use of edaravone to reduce specific side effects of chemo-, radio- and immuno-therapy of cancers.</a></h1><p>The drug edaravone (EDA) is prescribed for the treatment of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or after an acute cerebral infarction. This synthetic pyrazolone derivative is a potent scavenger of oxygen free radicals and also functions as a modulator of transcription factors, repressing NFκB and activating Nrf2, to regulate oxidative stress. EDA displays complementary anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory effects. The injectable small molecule is currently investigated for the treatment of several non-neurological diseases. The potential interest of EDA in oncology is reviewed here. EDA is a mild antiproliferative agent but has been found to enhance significantly the anticancer and antimetastatic activities of irinotecan in a colon cancer model. Anticancer derivatives of EDA have been designed but they generally display a limited antiproliferative activity. The antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity of EDA can be best exploited to protect non-tumor cells from damages induced by chemotherapeutic drugs and radiations. Notably EDA can reduce the renal dysfunction induced by cisplatin, the neurotoxicity of cyclophosphamide and the cardiotoxicity of doxorubicin. Upon treatment with EDA, a significant improvement in neurologic symptoms has been observed in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma after radiotherapy. The drug could be used to limit radiation-induced brain injury or oral mucositis. EDA was found to ameliorate autoimmune thyroiditis (Hashimoto thyroiditis), which is a frequent side effect observed after treatment of cancer patients with monoclonal antibodies targeting the   PD-1. Therefore, EDA could also be useful to reduce specific side effects of immuno-therapy. Collectively, the information suggests that the medical use of EDA, a drug with a proven safety after 18 years of use in brain-related Human diseases, could be extended to cancer-related conditions.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

However, their efficacy has been limited by slow diffusion of molecules and often requires external triggers. Herein, an autonomous and degradable, active microneedle delivery platform is introduced, employing magnesium microparticles loaded within the microneedle patch, as the built-in engine for deeper and faster intradermal payload delivery. The magnesium particles react with the interstitial fluid, leading to an explosive-like rapid production of H bubbles, providing the necessary force to breach dermal barriers and enhance payload delivery. The release kinetics of active microneedles is evaluated in vitro by measuring the amount of IgG antibody (as a model drug) that passed through phantom tissue and a pigskin barrier. In vivo experiments using a B16F10 mouse melanoma model demonstrate that the active delivery of anti-CTLA-4 (a  inhibitor drug) results in greatly enhanced  response and significantly longer survival. Moreover, spatially resolved zones of active and passive microneedles allow a combinatorial rapid burst response along with slow, sustained release, respectively. Such versatile and effective autonomous dynamic microneedle delivery technology offers considerable promise for a wide range of therapeutic applications, toward a greatly enhanced outcome, convenience, and cost.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

ICIs can produce durable antitumor responses but they are also associated with -related adverse events (irAEs). Endocrinopathies have reported as one of the most common irAEs of ICIs.This study aimed to quantify association of endocrine adverse events (AEs) and ICI therapy and also to characterize the profiles of ICI-related endocrine complications from real-world practice. Data from the first quarter of 2014 to first quarter of 2019 in FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database were gathered to conduct disproportionality analysis. The definition of endocrine AEs relied on the preferred terms (PTs) provided by the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). Two signal indices based on statistical shrinkage transformation, reporting odds ratios (ROR) and information component (IC), were used to evaluate correlations between ICIs and endocrine events. For ROR, it was defined a signal if the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval (ROR) more than one, with at least 3 cases. For IC, lower end of the 95% confidence interval of IC (IC) exceeding zero was deemed statistically significant.A total of 29,294,336 records were involved, among these 6260 records related to endocrine AEs after ICIs treatment were identified. In general, male had a slightly lower reporting frequencies for ICIs-related endocrinopathies compared with female but not significant (ROR = 0.98 95%CI: 0.93-1.04) and the difference varied in several common endocrine AEs. Notably, in general, ICI drugs were significantly associated with over-reporting frequencies of endocrine complications, corresponding to IC = 2.49 and ROR = 5.99. For monotherapy, three strategies (anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1 and anti-CTLA-4) were all associated with significant increasing endocrine events. Different reporting frequencies emerged when anti-CTLA-4 therapy was compared with anti-PD-1/PD-L1 medications for endocrine toxicities, corresponding to ROR = 1.68 (95%CI 1.55-1.83), ROR = 2.54 (95%CI 2.20-2.93), respectively. Combination therapy was associated with higher risk of endocrinopathies compared with monotherapy (ROR = 2.00, 95%CI 1.89-2.11). When further analysis, the spectrum of endocrine AEs differed in immunotherapy regimens. Hypothyroidism (N = 885,14.14%), adrenal insufficiency(N = 730,11.66%), hypophysitis (N = 688,10.99%) and hyperthyroidism (N = 472,7.54%) were top 4 ranked endocrine events after ICI therapy and their reporting frequency also differed in ICI immunotherapies.Our pharmacovigilance analysis shows a high reporting frequency of endocrine AEs provoked by ICI monotherapy (especially anti-CTLA-4 therapy) and further reinforced by combination therapy. In addition, treatment with different ICI immunotherapies may result in a unique and distinct profile of endocrinopathies. Early recognition and management of ICI-related endocrine irAEs is of vital importance in clinical practice.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671774>Role of Focal Adhesion Kinase in Small- Lung Cancer and Its Potential as a Therapeutic Target.</a></h1><p>Small- lung cancer (SCLC) represents 15% of all lung cancers and it is clinically the most aggressive type, being characterized by a tendency for early metastasis, with two-thirds of the patients diagnosed with an extensive stage (ES) disease and a five-year overall survival (OS) as low as 5%. There are still no effective targeted therapies in SCLC despite improved understanding of the molecular steps leading to SCLC development and progression these last years. After four decades, the only modest improvement in OS of patients suffering from ES-SCLC has recently been shown in a trial combining atezolizumab, an anti-PD-L1   inhibitor, with carboplatin and etoposide, chemotherapy agents. This highlights the need to pursue research efforts in this field. Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is a non-receptor protein tyrosine kinase that is overexpressed and activated in several cancers, including SCLC, and contributing to cancer progression and metastasis through its important role in  proliferation, survival, adhesion, spreading, migration, and invasion. FAK also plays a role in tumor  evasion, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, DNA damage repair, radioresistance, and regulation of cancer stem cells. FAK is of particular interest in SCLC, being known for its aggressiveness. The inhibition of FAK in SCLC  lines demonstrated significative decrease in  proliferation, invasion, and migration, and induced   arrest and apoptosis. In this review, we will focus on the role of FAK in cancer cells and their microenvironment, and its potential as a therapeutic target in SCLC.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695804>Small molecules as theranostic agents in cancer immunology.</a></h1><p>With further research into the molecular mechanisms and roles linking  suppression and restraint of (pre)malignancies, immunotherapies have revolutionized clinical strategies in the treatment of cancer. However, nearly 70% of patients who received   therapeutics showed no response. Complementary and/or synergistic effects may occur when extracellular  antibody blockades combine with small molecules targeting intracellular signal pathways up/downstream of   or regulating the innate and adaptive  response. After radiolabeling with radionuclides, small molecules can also be used for estimating treatment efficacy of   blockades. This review not only highlights some significant intracellular pathways and -related targets such as the kynurenine pathway, purinergic signaling, the kinase signaling axis, chemokines, etc., but also summarizes some attractive and potentially immunosuppression-related small molecule agents, which may be synergistic with extracellular   blockade. In addition, opportunities for small molecule-based theranostics in cancer immunology will be discussed.© The author(s).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693508>A Pilot Study of Radiation Therapy in Combination With Pembrolizumab in Patients With Metastatic Renal  Cancer.</a></h1><p>There is no study published regarding the benefit of radiation therapy (RT) in combination with   inhibitors (ICIs) for the treatment of metastatic renal  cancer (mRCC). This report is part of an exploratory study aiming to determine the immunomodulatory activity of RT alone or in combination with pembrolizumab in solid tumors.mRCC patients were treated with a combination of RT (8 Gy×1 or 4 Gy×5) followed by pembrolizumab with or without lead-in dose of pembrolizumab. Treatment response was measured based on the modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors criteria. Adverse events were monitored and graded. Pre-RT and post-RT tumor biopsies were obtained to evaluate programmed death-ligand 1 expression.  markers from peripheral blood before, during, and after treatment were analyzed using flow cytometry.Twelve mRCC patients who progressed on prior antiangiogenic therapy were enrolled. Half had 2 lines of prior therapy. Two patients (16.7%) had partial responses and were on study for 12.4 and 14.5 months. Three patients had stable disease for a period ranging from 4.2 to 10.4 months, whereas 7 patients had progressive disease. Median progression-free survival was 8.6 months and median overall survival was 32.3 months. Three patients had grade ≥3 events (hyperglycemia, thrombocytopenia, transaminitis). Biopsied tissue programmed death-ligand 1 expression and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes were numerically higher in responders comparing to nonresponders (Modified Proportion Score 45% vs. 30.45%; tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes odds ratio 4.92).Combining RT with pembrolizumab in pretreated mRCC is well-tolerated and appears to have comparable efficacy with single-agent nivolumab.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31698313>Clinical pharmacology of monoclonal antibodies targeting anti-PD-1 axis in urothelial cancers.</a></h1><p>Chemotherapy is the reference treatment for patients with advanced urothelial carcinoma, both in the neo-adjuvant and adjuvant settings; however, the overall outcome remains poor in this patient population.

In this study, we aimed to evaluate the relationship between PLR and survival of cancer patients treated with   inhibitors (ICIs).A systematical search was performed in databases including PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane library to retrieve potential eligible clinical studies assessing the prognosis of cancer patients with high versus low PLR after immunotherapy, from the establishment of the database to June 2019. Quality evaluation of included studies was performed, and meta-analyses with regards to overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were conducted using RevMan 5.3 and STATA 11.A total of 12 eligible studies with 1340 cancer patients were included. Combined results showed that elevated PLR was a negative factor affecting the efficacy of ICIs in cancer patients. Patients with high PLR had a significantly shorter OS compared to those with low PLR (hazard ratio (HR) = 2.02, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.46 to 2.80, P < 0.0001), as well as PFS (HR = 1.74, 95%CI: 1.27 to 2.38, P = 0.0006). Similar results were observed in sensitivity analyses. Subgroup analyses revealed that the prognostic role of PLR on OS and PFS was dependent on cancer type, region, and cutoff value. For NSCLC patients, the disease stage, ICIs agent, and line of treatment may not influence the prognostic role of PLR.PLR could be a routinely potential prognostic factor for ICIs. Low PLR may be associated with better survival for cancer patients when treated with immunotherapy.Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

The rising incidence of MCC, together with its often rapidly aggressive course, underscore a critical need to recognize the histopathologic and the immunohistochemical features that inform its accurate diagnosis. In the current review, we summarize the current state of knowledge regarding the accurate diagnosis of MCC and the exclusion of other entities in the differential diagnosis. We provide a comprehensive review of genomic studies that identified the molecular-genetic drivers of MCC as well as a summary of studies identifying prognostic biomarkers that can facilitate risk stratification. Importantly, Merkel  polyomavirus (MCPyV) appears to be causative in most cases of MCC and represents both a diagnostic and prognostic marker. Finally, as staging of MCC has undergone critical refinements with the introduction of the 8th Edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer staging system, we provide an update on MCC staging. In particular, the prognostic significance of the sentinel lymph node (SLN) in MCC necessitates a systematic approach to its evaluation and diagnosis to ensure accurate and consistent risk stratification for patients, and we therefore provide a comprehensive overview of SLN evaluation in MCC. Finally, the intimate relationship between MCC and the integrity of the host  system has led to paradigm-shifting therapeutic advances with the successful application of   blockade to treat patients with advanced disease, and we therefore summarize those studies and the correlative studies in which predictive biomarkers have been identified.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655605>The role of PD-L1 expression as a predictive biomarker: an analysis of all US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approvals of   inhibitors.</a></h1><p>The development of   inhibitors has changed the treatment paradigm for advanced cancers across many tumor types. Despite encouraging and sometimes durable responses in a subset of patients, most patients do not respond. Tumors have adopted the PD-1/PD-L1 axis for  escape to facilitate tumor growth, which can be leveraged as a potential target for   inhibitors. On this basis, PD-L1 protein expression on tumor or  cells emerged as the first potential predictive biomarker for sensitivity to   blockade. The goal of our study was to evaluate PD-L1 as a predictive biomarker based on all US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) drug approvals of   inhibitors. We evaluated the primary studies associated with 45 FDA drug approvals from 2011 until April 2019. In total, there were approvals across 15 tumor types. Across all approvals, PD-L1 was predictive in only 28.9% of cases, and was either not predictive (53.3%) or not tested (17.8%) in the remaining cases. There were 9 FDA approvals linked to a specific PD-L1 threshold and companion diagnostic: bladder cancer (N = 3), non-small  lung cancer (N = 3), triple-negative breast cancer (N = 1), cervical cancer (N = 1), and gastric/gastroesophageal junction cancer (N = 1) with 8 of 9 (88.9%) with   inhibitor monotherapy. The PD-L1 thresholds were variable both within and across tumor types using several different assays, including approvals at the following PD-L1 thresholds: 1, 5, and 50%. PD-L1 expression was also measured in a variable fashion either on tumor cells, tumor-infiltrating  cells, or both. In conclusion, our findings indicate that PD-L1 expression as a predictive biomarker has limitations and that the decision to pursue testing must be carefully implemented for clinical decision-making.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666813>CORRIGENDUM to The mechanisms of acute interstitial nephritis in the era of   inhibitors in melanoma.</a></h1><p>[This corrects the article DOI: 10.1177/1758835919875549.].© The Author(s), 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694138>[Progress of   inhibitors in neoadjuvant therapy of non-small  lung cancer].</a></h1><p>Lung cancer carries the highest morbidity and mortality out of all malignancies in the world. About 85% of all cases are non-small  lung cancer (NSCLC). Surgery is currently the optimal treatment for early-stage NSCLC, however, the postoperative recurrence rate is relatively high and the long-term survival of these patients is still a problem to be overcomed. Previous studies have shown that early-stage NSCLC patients may benefit from preoperative neoadjuvant chemotherapy when compared to surgery alone, although the benefit is only moderate. More recent publications indicate that   blockade may have better potential in neoadjuvant therapy, with reported major pathological response rates at 20% to 85%, compared to chemotherapy alone. Phase Ⅲ random clinical trials are being implemented to confirm the effect of neoadjuvant immunotherapy in NSCLC.

This is based mainly on the partial reversal of the exhausted phenotype of antigen-specific cytotoxic CD8 T cells (CTL). Recently, we have shown that the restoration of HIV-specific T  function depends on the HIV infection stage of an infected individual. Here we aimed to answer two fundamental questions: (i) Can one estimate growth parameters for the HIV-specific proliferative responsiveness upon PD-L1 blockade ex vivo? (ii) Can one use these parameter estimates to predict clinical benefit for HIV-infected individuals displaying diverse infection phenotypes? To answer these questions, we first analyzed HIV-1 Gag-specific CD8 T  proliferation by time-resolved CFSE assays and estimated the effect of PD-L1 blockade on division and death rates, and specific precursor frequencies. These values were then incorporated into a model for CTL-mediated HIV control and the effects on CTL frequencies, viral loads and CD4 T  counts were predicted for different infection phenotypes. The biggest absolute increase in CD4 T  counts was in the group of slow progressors while the strongest reduction in virus loads was observed in progressor patients. These results suggest a significant clinical benefit only for a subgroup of HIV-infected individuals. However, as PD1 is a marker of lymphocyte activation and expressed on several lymphocyte subsets including also CD4 T cells and B cells, we subsequently examined the multiple effects of anti-PD-L1 blockade beyond those on CD8 T cells. This extended model then predicts that the net effect on HIV load and CD4 T  number depends on the interplay between positive and negative effects of lymphocyte subset activation. For a physiologically relevant range of affected model parameters, PD-L1 blockade is likely to be overall beneficial for HIV-infected individuals.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660091>Immunomodulatory aspects in the progression and treatment of oral malignancy.</a></h1><p>Inflammation substantially affects the risk of oral malignancy. Pro-inflammatory cytokine, interferon (IFN)-γ, confers anti-tumor activity using several different mechanisms. Conversely, higher expression of interleukin (IL)-17 is associated with worse prognosis. Monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-1 correlates positively with poor long-term survival of head and neck squamous  carcinoma (HNSCC) patients. IL-1α affects cancer associated fibroblasts and macrophages, and promote several malignant phenotypes including  suppression. Some anti-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-10 and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β, relate to pro-tumoral activities. Among   modulators, programmed death (PD-)1 and PD-ligand (L)1 facilitate oral squamous  carcinoma (OSCC)  evasion from  surveillance, and the expression status of these has a prognostic value. OSCCs contain tumor associated macrophages (TAMs) as major stromal cells of their tumor microenvironment. Among the two distinctive states, M2 macrophages support tumor invasion, metastasis and  suppression. Crosstalk between TAMs and OSCC or cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAF) plays an important role in the progression of OSCC. Clinical trials with blocking antibodies against IL-1α or melanoma-associated antigens have been reported as therapeutic approaches against OSCCs. The most promising approach activating antitumor immunity is the blockade of PD-1/PD-L1 axis. Manipulating the polarization of pro-tumorigenic macrophages has been reported as a novel therapeutic approach.© 2019 The Authors.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694070>Characterization of tumour mutation burden in patients with non-small  lung cancer and interstitial lung disease.</a></h1><p>The efficacy expectation of   inhibitors against NSCLC in patients with ILD seems to be high because these populations are supposed to have high TMB. However, information about the characterization of TMB in patients with NSCLC and ILD is limited. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate TMB in samples of NSCLC with ILD and clarify factors that influence TMB values.The medical records of patients with NSCLC who underwent thoracic surgery at our institution between January 2014 and January 2017 were retrospectively reviewed. Whole-exome sequencing with an Ion Proton system and gene expression profiling of fresh surgical specimens were performed.Among 367 patients with NSCLC, 62 (16.9%) were diagnosed with ILD. All samples were collected from primary tumours with a median TMB of approximately 2.1 (range: 0.1-64.4) mutation/Mb. Among 81 squamous  carcinomas, we compared 27 tumours with concomitant ILD and 54 tumours without ILD. Univariate analyses revealed that tumours with concomitant ILD showed lower TMB values than those without ILD. Multivariate analysis revealed that concomitant ILD was significantly associated with low TMB values. Conversely, no difference was noted in the TMB value of adenocarcinoma between patients with and without ILD.Squamous  carcinoma and adenocarcinoma with ILD do not have high TMB values. Therefore, considering the risk of severe pneumonitis,   inhibitors should not be used routinely against patients with NSCLC and ILD based on the expectation of high TMB values.© 2019 The Authors.

Although these treatment modalities have shown to decrease tumor burden, a major limitation to chemothearpy/radiotherapy is the high recurrence rate in patients. -modulation strategies have emerged as a promising new therapeutic avenue to reduce this recurrence rate while minimizing undesirable systemic side effects. This review will focus specifically on the mechanisms of monoclonal antibodies:   inhibitors and cytokines, as well as current drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and new clinical/pre-clinical trials. Finally, this review will investigate emerging methods used to monitor tumor response post-treatment.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Although a subset of patients is able to achieve durable responses, the majority experience eventual disease progression on existing therapies. Trials evaluating novel combinatorial strategies,  inhibitors,  agonists, T -based therapies, intratumoral agents, and others are ongoing. While strides have been made in the treatment of advanced melanoma, further research is needed to identify alternative  and molecular targets in order to overcome resistance and achieve better clinical outcomes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663411>Immunotherapy in renal  carcinoma from poverty to the spoiled of choice.</a></h1><p>Management of metastatic renal  carcinoma has been enriched by the advent of new therapeutic compounds. The approval of new combination strategies between targeted agents and - inhibitors as well as the administration of combinations between - inhibitors has clearly demonstrated significant improvement toward patients' prognosis and other clinical outcomes. Due to the availability of different treatments, the choice between them may be a difficult issue in our clinical practice. We have summarized current knowledge about available treatments focusing on criteria, which may help clinicians to make decisions.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694714>Antibiotic therapy and outcome from - inhibitors.</a></h1><p>Sensitivity to   inhibitor (ICPI) therapy is governed by a complex interplay of tumor and host-related determinants. Epidemiological studies have highlighted that exposure to antibiotic therapy influences the probability of response to ICPI and predict for shorter patient survival across malignancies. Whilst a number of studies have reproducibly documented the detrimental effect of broad-spectrum antibiotics, the -biologic mechanisms underlying the association with outcome are poorly understood. Perturbation of the gut microbiota, an increasingly well-characterized factor capable of influencing ICPI-mediated  reconstitution, has been indicated as a putative mechanism to explain the adverse effects attributed to antibiotic exposure in the context of ICPI therapy. Prospective studies are required to validate antibiotic-mediated gut perturbations as a mechanism of ICPI refractoriness and guide the development of strategies to overcome this barrier to an effective delivery of anti-cancer immunotherapy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31677289>Should you repeat mismatch repair testing in tumour recurrences? An evaluation of repeat mismatch repair testing by immunohistochemistry in recurrent tumours of the gastrointestinal and gynaecological tracts.</a></h1><p>The role of mismatch repair (MMR) testing has evolved from identifying Lynch syndrome patients to predicting response to   inhibitors. This has led to requests from clinicians to retest recurrences of MMR proficient primary tumours in the hope that the recurrence may show a different MMR status and qualify the patient for treatment. We aimed to determine whether repeat testing is warranted.We evaluated recurrent tumours (local recurrences or metastases) from 137 patients with MMR proficient primary tumours of the gastrointestinal and gynaecological tracts. The local recurrences and metastases all occurred at least 30 days after resection of the primary tumour. We used a combination of a tissue microarray (TMA) and whole slide staining to perform immunohistochemistry (IHC) for PMS2, MLH1, MSH2 and MSH6 and compared the results to the MMR status of the primary tumour. 3/137 (2%) initially showed a discordant staining pattern. However, further investigation showed that these discordances were attributed to some of the known pitfalls associated with MMR IHC interpretation - post radiotherapy loss of MSH6 expression and subclonal loss of MLH1 staining. We did not identify any cases with a genuine discordance in MMR status.We conclude that repeat MMR IHC testing of recurrences is not warranted as the MMR status does not change relative to that of the primary tumour.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31697341>Vasospastic angina following   blockade.</a></h1><p></p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694890>Diagnosis and Management of Rare -Related Adverse Events.</a></h1><p>Oncologic treatment is being revolutionized by a burgeoning number of   inhibitors (ICPis). To date, seven ICPis have received Food and Drug Administration approval, targeting cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen, programmed  death, or programmed  death ligand. Adverse events associated with  inhibition have been described in the literature. Guidelines exist for the most common of these, but as the use of ICPis becomes more common, the number of patients presenting with rare events will increase. This article reviews the diagnosis and management of rare ocular, hematological, luminal gastrointestinal, and rheumatological toxicities arising from ICPi treatment. KEY POINTS: As the use of   inhibitors (ICPis) becomes more common, the number of rare -related adverse events (irAEs) will increase. A high level of suspicion is required to identify and treat these toxicities.Although it can be difficult to definitively attribute rare irAEs to ICPis, a temporal and mechanistic relationship and the absence of other etiologies should make the treating physician suspicious for a rare irAE.Certain rare irAEs, such as celiac disease, do not require treatment with glucocorticoids. Thus, differentiating this irAE from other gastrointestinal irAEs has important implications for treatment.© AlphaMed Press 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696513>An update on potentials and promises of T  co-signaling molecules in transplantation.</a></h1><p>The promising outcomes of - based immunotherapies in cancer have provided a proportional perspective ahead of exploiting similar approaches in allotransplantation. Belatacept (CTLA-4-Ig) is an example of costimulation blockers successfully exploited in renal transplantation. Due to the wide range of regulatory molecules characterized in the past decades, some of these molecules might be candidates as immunomodulators in the case of tolerance induction in transplantation. Although there are numerous attempts on the apprehension of the effects of co-signaling molecules on  response, the necessity for a better understanding is evident. By increasing the knowledge on the biology of co-signaling pathways, some pitfalls are recognized and improved approaches are proposed. The blockage of CD80/CD28 axis is an instance of evolution toward more efficacy. It is now evident that anti-CD28 antibodies are more effective than CD80 blockers in animal models of transplantation. Other co-signaling axes such as PD-1/PD-L1, CD40/CD154, 2B4/CD48, and others discussed in the present review are examples of critical immunomodulatory molecules in allogeneic transplantation. We review here the outcomes of recent experiences with co-signaling molecules in preclinical studies of solid organ transplantation.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31677920>The B7x   Pathway: From Discovery to Clinical Trial.</a></h1><p>B7x (B7 homolog x, also known as B7-H4, B7S1, and VTCN1) was discovered by ourselves and others in 2003 as the seventh member of the B7 family. It is an inhibitory   of great significance to human disease. Tissue-expressed B7x minimizes autoimmune and inflammatory responses. It is overexpressed in a broad spectrum of human cancers, where it suppresses antitumor immunity. Further, B7x and PD-L1 tend to have mutually exclusive expression in cancer cells. Therapeutics targeting B7x are effective in animal models of cancers and autoimmune disorders, and early-phase clinical trials are underway to determine the efficacy and safety of targeting B7x in human diseases. It took 15 years moving from the discovery of B7x to clinical trials. Further studies will be necessary to identify its receptors, reveal its physiological functions in organs, and combine therapies targeting B7x with other treatments.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

IFNa2b affects many  intrinsic features of tumor cells and modulates the host innate and cognate  responses. To better understand the biological traits associated with ulceration that could explain the efficacy of prophylactic type 1 IFN, we performed immunohistochemical analysis of various molecules (major histocompatibility complex class I and class II, MX Dynamin Like GTPase 1 (MX1), inducible Nitric-Oxide Synthase (iNOS) or CD47) in two retrospective cohorts of melanoma patients, one diagnosed with a primary cutaneous melanoma (1995-2013, N = 172, among whom 49% were ulcerated melanoma (UM)) and a second one diagnosed with metastatic melanoma amenable to lymph node resection (EORTC 18952 and 18991 trials, N = 98, among whom 44% were UM). We found that primary and metastatic UM exhibit higher basal expression of MHC class I molecules, independently of Breslow thickness, histology and lymphocytic infiltration compared with NUM and that primary UM harbored higher constitutive levels of the antiviral protein Mx1 at the border of tumor beds than NUM. These findings suggest that UM expand in a tumor microenvironment where chronic exposure to type 1 IFN could favor a response to exogenous IFNs.© 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696664>Nanotechnology platforms for cancer immunotherapy.</a></h1><p>Various cancer therapies have advanced remarkably over the past decade. Unlike the direct therapeutic targeting of tumor cells, cancer immunotherapy is a new strategy that boosts the host's  system to detect specific cancer cells for efficient elimination. Nanoparticles incorporating immunomodulatory agents can activate  cells and modulate the tumor microenvironment to enhance antitumor immunity. Such nanoparticle-based cancer immunotherapies have received considerable attention and have been extensively studied in recent years. This review thus focuses on nanoparticle-based platforms (especially naturally derived nanoparticles and synthetic nanoparticles) utilized in recent advances; summarizes delivery systems that incorporate various -modulating agents, including peptides and nucleic acids,   inhibitors, and other small immunostimulating agents; and introduces combinational cancer immunotherapy with nanoparticles, especially nanoparticle-based photo-immunotherapy and nanoparticle-based chemo-immunotherapy. Undoubtedly, the recent studies introduced in this review prove that nanoparticle-incorporated cancer immunotherapy is a highly promising treatment modality for patients with cancer. Nonetheless further research is needed to solve safety concerns and improve efficacy of nanoplatform-based cancer immunotherapy for future clinical application.

The highly porous framework of UPMSNP provides a large capacity for aPD-L1. Fer capping of the pores extends the period of aPD-L1 release and provides MR visibility of the aPD-L1 loaded UPMSNP. As-chosen Cbz chemotherapy prior to the local immunotherapy induces strong immunogenic  death, dendritic  maturation, and upregulation of PD-L1 of tumor cells. Finally, tumor growth inhibition of sequential MR image-guided local delivery of Fer-ICB-UPMSNPs and a tumor specific adoptive  reaction are demonstrated in the pretreated Tramp C1 PC mouse model with Cbz chemotherapy. The tumor suppression is superior to those obtained with systemic ICB treatment after Cbz, only Fer-ICB-UPMSNP or only Cbz. As a proof-of concept, MR image-guided local ICB immunotherapy using Fer-ICB-UPMSNPs after chemotherapy suggests a new perspective of translational local immunotherapy for patients who are treated with standard chemotherapies.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Nivolumab, one of the anti-programmed  death 1 antibodies, was the first   inhibitor to be approved and is used as a standard second-line regimen for patients with non-small  lung cancer irrespective of the expression of programmed  death ligand 1. Programmed  death 1 antibodies have been generally confirmed to be less toxic than conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy, although unusual -related adverse events such as type I diabetes mellitus, adrenal failure, and myasthenia gravis may occur with a very low incidence. A case of severe grade V -related thrombocytopenia after two courses of nivolumab as second-line therapy for relapsed non-small  lung cancer is reported.An 82-year-old Japanese woman with relapsed lung adenocarcinoma was treated with nivolumab as second-line systemic therapy at our institute. Her laboratory data indicated thrombocytopenia suspected to be an -related adverse event following two courses of nivolumab. Subsequently, she developed a massive pulmonary hemorrhage and left cerebral infarction despite intensive treatment including systemic steroid therapy. Although there have been a few reports of thrombocytopenia caused by nivolumab, this is the first report of grade V thrombocytopenia following administration of nivolumab for relapsed non-small  lung cancer.A very difficult case of grade V -related thrombocytopenia after the administration of nivolumab as second-line therapy for relapsed lung adenocarcinoma was described. -related thrombocytopenia is a rare adverse event, but it must be considered a possible complication because it may become critical once it has occurred.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31683094>Thorough survey and analysis of pulmonary lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma in Macau and multimodality treatment for advanced disease.</a></h1><p>Pulmonary lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma (LELC) is a rare type of non-small  lung cancer. The clinical course and prognosis of advanced LELC are largely unknown. Few reports have discussed multimodality treatment for LELC.This retrospective study identified records from 2007 to 2018 of pulmonary LELCs and other lung cancer subtypes from hospital information systems and collected demographic, treatment, and survival data.In this cohort of 69 LELCs (median age: 55.4), more female, non-smokers, and fewer right upper lobe tumors (4.3%) were observed in the LELC subgroup compared with others. The median overall survival (OS) of LELCs was 40 months, superior to other subtypes (p < 0.05), except adenocarcinoma (p = 0.062). Patients with early stage disease and primary tumor resection tended to have better OS in univariate analysis, but surgery was the independent predictor in multivariate analysis (0.042). The median OS of 52 advanced LELCs was 22.7 months. Platinum-based chemotherapy and radiotherapy with curative purpose were independent predictors for OS of advanced LELCs (p = 0.004 and 0.003, respectively). For patients who received multimodality treatment in advanced setting, the median line of treatments was two. The overall response and disease-control rates were 61.8% and 80.6%, respectively. There were no differences in response or survival between patients receiving taxane-combined and non-taxane-combined chemotherapy. However, patients treated with radiotherapy in upfront settings had significantly favorable response and progression-free survival compared with those without. One case with PD-L1 positivity had pembrolizumab in the 4 line and achieved tumor shrinkage and stable disease for 12 months.Patients who underwent radical resection of primary tumors had better prognoses. Patients with advanced LELC could achieve satisfactory survival by receiving multimodality treatment, including platinum-based chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy.   inhibitors may be part of future therapies. A well-organized clinical trial should be performed to determine the optimal treatment regimen.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Recent evidence suggests that these cells might be responsible for tumor relapse and treatment resistance. Conventional cancer treatment modalities like chemotherapy and radiotherapy usually fail in eradicating CSCs in a tumor mass. Preclinical studies aiming at targeting CSCs have yielded great promise to increase the cancer cure rate. Likewise, targeting of conventional chemotherapeutic drugs to the CSCs and new small molecule inhibitors of stem- signaling pathways in humans carry the potential of improving the cancer management. Dendritic  (DC)-based vaccines seem to be safe and efficient tools in targeting CSCs. The combination of DC vaccines with - inhibitors is also promising. The viral vectors, particularly the oncolytic viruses, targeting CSCs have emerged as potential curative agents in cancer treatment. Here, we review the recent advances in targeting CSCs via stem  markers, signaling pathways,  system, cancer vaccines, and viral treatments.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31686799>Effect of PD-1 inhibitor on exhaled nitric oxide and pulmonary function in non-small  lung cancer patients with and without COPD.</a></h1><p>Nivolumab, a programmed death 1 (PD-1)   inhibitor, has been shown to improve survival in non-small  lung cancer (NSCLC). The possible involvement of PD-1 axis in the pathogenesis of inflammatory lung disease, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has also been reported. However, effects of PD-1 blockade on the respiratory system remain unknown.This prospective study aimed to investigate whether inhibition of the PD-1 axis altered lung inflammation and pulmonary function in NSCLC patients with and without COPD.This was a prospective multi-center study. Measurements of fractioned exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) and pulmonary function were performed before and after 4 cycles of nivolumab therapy.A total of 137 patients with NSCLC were initially enrolled, and subsequently 95 patients (41 COPD and 54 non-COPD) receiving 4 cycles of nivolumab administration were included. After anti-PD-1 therapy, FeNO levels were significantly elevated together with increase in peripheral eosinophils. Interestingly, significant FeNO elevation was only found in COPD patients without increased peripheral eosinophils, but this was not the case in non-COPD patients. Additionally, COPD patients exhibited significant increases in FVC and FEV but no changes in dyspnea scales, and acute exacerbation did not occur during the therapy.Our observations suggest that anti-PD-1 therapy changed FeNO levels and pulmonary function in NSCLC patients. This therapy does not worsen COPD in terms of symptoms, pulmonary function, or acute exacerbation.© 2019 Suzuki et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665365>  Profiles in Luminal B Breast Cancer (Alliance).</a></h1><p>Unlike estrogen receptor (ER) negative breast cancer, ER-positive breast cancer outcome is less influenced by lymphocyte content indicating the presence of  tolerance mechanisms that may be specific to this disease subset.A supervised analysis of microarray data from the Alliance/ACOSOG Z1031 neoadjuvant aromatase inhibitor (AI) trial identified upregulated genes in Luminal B breast cancers that correlated with AI-resistant tumor proliferation (Pearson's correlation r ≥ 0.4 with Ki67) (33 cases Ki67 >10% on AI) versus Luminal-B breast cancers that were more AI-sensitive (33 cases Ki67 <10% on AI). Over-representation analysis was performed using Webgestalt.Thirty candidate genes positively correlated (r ≥ 0.4) with AI-resistant proliferation in Luminal B and were upregulated >2 fold. Gene ontologies identified that the targetable - components IDO1, LAG3, and PD1 were over-represented resistance candidates (p ≤ 0.001). High IDO1 mRNA associated with poor prognosis in luminal-B disease (METABRIC, HR = 1.43, CI 1.04 - 1.98, p = 0.03). IDO1 also statistically significantly correlated with STAT1 at protein level in luminal-B disease (Pearson's r = 0.74). As a composite  tolerance signature, expression of IFN-γ/STAT1 pathway components associated with higher baseline Ki67, lower estrogen and progesterone receptor mRNA levels and worse disease specific survival (p = 0.002). In a tissue microarray analysis (TMA), IDO1 was observed in stromal cells and tumor-associated macrophages, with a higher incidence in Luminal-B cases. Furthermore, IDO1 expression associated with a macrophage mRNA signature (M1 by CIBERSORT Pearson's r = 0.62 ) and also by TMA analysis.Targetable - components are upregulated in majority of endocrine therapy resistant Luminal-B cases.

Here, we aimed to assess and compare the utility of serum 5-S-CD and lactate dehydrogenase levels as markers for predicting the effects of nivolumab in advanced malignant melanoma.Baseline serum 5-S-CD and lactate dehydrogenase levels in patients with unresectable stage IIIC and IV malignant melanoma treated with nivolumab ( = 21) were analyzed to determine their utility as predictive markers for survival. We also analyzed the prognostic value of these markers among patients with only stage IV malignant melanoma ( = 17).Our analysis showed that patients with baseline serum 5-S-CD levels >25.0 nmol/L had significantly poor prognosis. In contrast, serum lactate dehydrogenase levels at the upper limit of the normal range did not exhibit such changes.Serum 5-S-CD levels have the potential to be an excellent predictive marker for the efficacy of nivolumab therapy in patients with advanced malignant melanoma.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656546>Imaging of T-cells and their responses during anti-cancer immunotherapy.</a></h1><p>Immunotherapy has proven to be an effective approach in a growing number of cancers. Despite durable clinical responses achieved with antibodies targeting   molecules, many patients do not respond. The common denominator for immunotherapies that have successfully been introduced in the clinic is their potential to induce or enhance infiltration of cytotoxic T-cells into the tumour. However, in clinical research the molecules, cells and processes involved in effective responses during immunotherapy remain largely obscure. Therefore,  imaging technologies that interrogate T- responses in patients represent a powerful tool to boost further development of immunotherapy. This review comprises a comprehensive analysis of the  imaging technologies that allow the characterisation of T- responses induced by anti-cancer immunotherapy, with emphasis on technologies that are clinically available or have high translational potential. Throughout we discuss their respective strengths and weaknesses, providing arguments for selecting the optimal imaging options for future research and patient management.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694834>Adding indoximod to hypofractionated radiotherapy with anti-PD-1  blockade enhances early NK and CD8+ T -dependent tumor activity.</a></h1><p>There is growing interest in combinations of immunogenic radiotherapy (RT) and   blockade, but clinical responses are still limited. Therefore, we tested the triple therapy with an inhibitor of the indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase pathway, which, like  , downregulates the antitumor  response.Triple treatment with hypofractionated RT (hRT) + αPD1 + indoximod was compared with the respective mono- and dual therapies in two syngeneic mouse models.The tumors did not regress following treatment with hRT + αPD1. The αPD1/indoximod combination was not effective at all. In contrast, triple treatment induced rapid, marked tumor regression, even in mice with a large tumor. The effects strongly depended on CD8+ T cells and partly on NK cells. Numbers and functionality of tumor-specific CD8+ T cells and NK cells were increased, particularly early during treatment. However, after 2.5‒3 weeks, all large tumors relapsed, which was accompanied by increased apoptosis of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes associated with a non-reprogrammable state of exhaustion, terminal differentiation and increased activation-induced  death, which could not be prevented by indoximod in these aggressive tumor models. Some mice with a smaller tumor were cured. Re-irradiation during late regression (day 12), but not after relapse, cured almost all mice with a large B16-CD133 tumor, and strongly delayed relapse in the less immunogenic 4T1 model, depending on CD8+ T cells.Our findings may serve as a rationale for the clinical evaluation of this triple combination therapy in patients with solitary or oligometastatic tumors in the neoadjuvant or the definitive setting.Copyright ©2019, American Association for Cancer Research.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31677359>Immunological Features of a Lung Cancer Patient Achieving an Objective Response with Anti-PD-1 Blockade Therapy.</a></h1><p>The role of   inhibitors in metastatic lung cancer has been established in recent year and the pre-therapeutic profiles of the tumor microenvironment in responders have been increasingly reported.

This interaction and others between surrounding costimulatory and  molecules promotes differentiation of naïve CD4 T lymphocytes into helper T cells subtypes including Th1, Th2, and Th17 that have more tailored immunologic responses. Although MHC II is mainly produced by professional antigen presenting cells, it can be aberrantly produced by other  types, including hepatocytes in various liver pathologies such as autoimmune hepatitis and alcoholic hepatitis. This can lead to direct targeting of hepatocytes by CD4 positive lymphocytes, which form an immunologic synapse with the hepatocyte. The lymphocytes internalize the MHC II - CD4 complexes in a phagocytosis-like mechanism and in the process eat the hepatocyte piece by piece. We review the evidence for this mechanism and the role of these autoimmune responses in various liver diseases, including alcoholic hepatitis, autoimmune hepatitis, and primary biliary cirrhosis. The role of aberrant MHC II in malignancy, including hepatocellular carcinoma, is also reviewed. Further understanding of this mechanism can lead to better understanding of the  mechanisms involved in these liver pathologies, with potential diagnostic and therapeutic applications.Copyright © 2019.

Unfortunately, not all patients respond to therapy while severe -related adverse effects are prevalent. Currently, patient stratification is based on immunotherapy marker expression through immunohistochemical analysis on biopsied material. However, expression can be heterogeneous within and between tumor lesions, amplifying the sampling limitations of biopsies. Analysis of immunotherapy target expression by non-invasive quantitative molecular imaging with PET or SPECT may overcome this issue. In this review, an overview of tracers that have been developed for preclinical and clinical imaging of key immunotherapy targets, such as programmed  death-1, programmed  death ligand-1, IDO1 and cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 is presented. We discuss important aspects to consider when developing such tracers and outline the future perspectives of molecular imaging of immunotherapy markers.

Here, we designed a biomaterials-based strategy for converting tumor-derived antigenic microparticles (T-MPs) into a cancer vaccine to meet this conundrum and demonstrated its therapeutic potential in multiple murine tumor models. The internal cavity of T-MPs was employed to store nano-Fe3O4 (Fe3O4/T-MPs) and then dense adjuvant CpG-loaded liposome arrays (CpG/Lipo) were tethered on the surface of Fe3O4/T-MP through mild surface engineering to get a vaccine (Fe3O4/T-MPs-CpG/Lipo), demonstrating that co-delivery of Fe3O4/T-MPs and CpG/Lipo to antigen presenting cells (APCs) could elicit strong tumor antigen-specific host  response. Meanwhile, vaccines distributed in TME could reverse infiltrated tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) into a tumor-suppressive M1 phenotype by nano-Fe3O4, amazingly induce abundant infiltration of cytotoxic T lymphocytes and transform "cold" tumor into "hot" tumor. Furthermore, amplified antitumor immunity was realized by the combination of Fe3O4/T-MPs-CpG/Lipo vaccine and   PD-L1 blockade, specifically inhibiting ∼83% progression of B16F10-bearing mice and extending the median survival time to 3 months. Overall, this study synergistically modulates tumor immunosuppressive network and host antitumor immunity in a spatiotemporal manner, which suggests a general -engineering strategy tailored to personalized vaccine from autologous cancer  materials of each individual patient.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31683225>Gene signatures of tumor inflammation and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) predict responses to   blockade in lung cancer with high accuracy.</a></h1><p>Treatment of non-small  lung cancer (NSCLC) with   blockade (ICB) has resulted in striking clinical responses, but only in a subset of patients. The goal of this study was to evaluate transcriptional signatures previously reported in the literature in an independent cohort of NSCLC patients receiving ICB.This retrospective study analyzed transcriptional profiles from pre-treatment tumor samples of 52 chemotherapy-refractory advanced NSCLC patients treated with anti-PD1/PD-L1 therapy. Gene signatures based on published reports were created and examined for their association with response to therapy and progression-free and overall survival (PFS, OS).Two signatures predicting response and outcomes were identified. One reflected the degree of  infiltration and upregulation of interferon-gamma-induced genes. A second reflected the EMT status. Compared to those not responding to therapy, patients whose tumors responded to ICB had higher scores in an inflammatory gene signature (6.0 ± 2.9 vs -5.5 ± 3.4, p = 0.014) or a more epithelial phenotype (-1.7 ± 1.0 vs 2.1 ± 1.2, p = 0.016). Both signatures demonstrated a satisfactory predictive accuracy for response: AUC of 0.69 (95% CI: 0.54, 0.84) for the inflammatory and 0.70 (95% CI: 0.55, 0.85) for EMT signatures, respectively. A weighted score combining EMT and inflammatory signatures showed increased predictive value with AUC of 0.92 (95% CI: 0.85, 0.99). Kaplan-Meier curves for patients above and below the median combined score showed a significant separation for PFS and OS (all p < 0.01, log rank test).The EMT/Inflammation signature score may be useful in directing  inhibitor therapy in lung cancer and suggests that reversal of EMT might augment efficacy of ICB.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

The authors report the case of a 62-year-old white male individual with metastatic choroidal melanoma who had commenced adjuvant systemic treatment with combination  inhibitor therapy of intravenous ipilimumab (anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4) and nivolumab (anti-programmed  death-1) at 3-week  intervals. On day 4 after the second , he developed an acute widespread rash. On examination there was confluent erythema with bullae and epidermal loss over 60% of the body surface area, with severe oral mucosal ulceration. A clinical diagnosis of toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) was made and he was transferred to the intensive care unit. Despite active treatment, he deteriorated systemically and died from multiorgan failure. This is the first reported case of TEN associated with nivolumab and ipilimumab dual therapy for metastatic uveal melanoma. Monotherapy improves survival in metastatic melanoma, but dual therapy has shown a greater mortality benefit at 3 years. Although the literature demonstrates case reports of Stevens-Johnson syndrome and TEN in association with nivolumab, ipilimumab has generally been regarded as a "safe" treatment with regard to severe cutaneous adverse reactions. With the increased use of immunotherapies, it is important to plan the management and early recognition of drug-related skin toxicity. This is of greatest concern during treatment initiation and with the higher risk associated with combination therapy. Reporting of adverse events and infrequently encountered complications with systemic biologic treatments will augment pharmacovigilance and improve the stratification of patients to treatments.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659111>The Activity of   Inhibition in KRAS Mutated Non-small  Lung Cancer: A Single Centre Experience.</a></h1><p>KRAS mutation is the most frequent molecular alteration found in advanced non-small  lung cancer (NSCLC). It is associated with a poor prognosis without available targeted therapy. Treatment options for NSCLC have been recently enriched by the development of   inhibitors (ICIs), and data about their efficacy in patients with KRAS-mutant NSCLC are discordant. This study assessed the routine efficacy of ICIs in advanced KRAS-mutant NSCLC.All stage IV NSCLC patients treated in our institution from January 2016 to December 2017 with immunotherapy were included in our analysis. We collected the status of KRAS and other mutations, as well as the type of ICI administered. We assessed four clinical outcomes: i) disease control rate (DCR), ii) partial response (PR), iii) progression-free survival (PFS) and iv) overall survival (OS).A total of 45 patients were initially identified but 7 were excluded due to insufficient clinical data, so 38 were included in the end. In the KRAS wild-type cohort, the DCR was 59% with 49% PR, while the PFS was 8.4 months and OS 16.8 months. Among KRAS mutated patients, results were more favourable, the DCR was 81%, with 62% PR. PFS was 13.6 months and OS was 18.5 months. The median follow-up was 24 months (17 to 34 months) and 7 patients were still on treatment at the time of analysis.Our data suggest that KRAS mutation is predictive of a superior response to immunotherapy. Furthermore, the lack of response of STK11 and KRAS co-mutated NSCLC patients to ICIs, is indeed negated by an additional TP53 mutation.Copyright© 2019, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.

Because   molecules are predominantly expressed on T cells, irAEs are largely not B -mediated. Here, we report a patient who was treated with pembrolizumab (a PD-1 monoclonal antibody) for lung adenocarcinoma with brain metastasis, and who developed anti-aquaporin-4 antibody (AQP4-Ab) positive neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD). We hypothesized that PD-1   blockage might induce a B -mediated  response in CNS resulting in this complication, which was further supported by the observation of a transient increase in plasmablasts in their CSF.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Increasing evidence suggests that the therapeutic efficacy of these tumor antigen-targeting mAbs is mediated - at least partially - by myeloid effector cells, which are controlled by the innate   interaction between CD47 and SIRPα. We and others have previously demonstrated that inhibiting CD47-SIRPα interactions can substantially potentiate antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) and cytotoxicity (ADCC) of tumor cells by IgG antibodies both in vivo and in vitro. IgA antibodies are superior in killing cancer cells by neutrophils compared to IgG antibodies with the same variable regions, but the impact of CD47-SIRPα on IgA-mediated killing has not been investigated. Here, we show that  inhibition of CD47-SIRPα interactions further enhances destruction of IgA antibody-opsonized cancer cells by human neutrophils. This was shown for multiple tumor types and IgA antibodies against different antigens, i.e. HER2/neu and EGFR. Consequently, combining IgA antibodies against HER2/neu or EGFR with SIRPα inhibition proved to be effective in eradicating cancer cells in vivo. In a syngeneic in vivo model, the eradication of cancer cells was predominantly mediated by granulocytes, which were actively recruited to the tumor site by SIRPα blockade. We conclude that IgA-mediated tumor  destruction can be further enhanced by CD47-SIRPα  inhibition. These findings provide a basis for targeting CD47-SIRPα interactions in combination with IgA therapeutic antibodies to improve their potential clinical efficacy in tumor patients.Copyright ©2019, American Association for Cancer Research.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657115>PGC-1α inhibits polyamine metabolism in Cyclin E1-driven ovarian cancer.</a></h1><p>Cyclin E1-driven ovarian cancer (OvCa) is characterized with metabolic shift. In this study, we aim to pinpoint the metabolic pathway altered and assess its therapeutic potential.In silico reproduction of TCGA ovarian cancer dataset and functional annotation using GSEA was performed. Candidate metabolic pathway was validated using in vitro and in vivo assays.From TCGA database, we found that polyamine metabolism was significantly enriched in Cyclin E1-driven OvCa. Expressions of SMS, SRM, and ODC1 were positively correlated with that of CCNE1, respectively. ODC1 and SMS expressions were significantly correlated with decreased  infiltrates. PGC-1α silencing significantly decreased invasion and migration in both OvCa  lines. Both spermidine and spermine levels were significantly increased when PGC-1α was silenced. Targeting SRM significantly decreased spermine level in OVCAR3 cells, which was rescued when PGC-1α was silenced. Silencing of PGC-1α resulted in increased SRM in both OvCa cells. Dinaciclib significantly decreased invasion and migration of OVCAR3 cells. Expressions of PD-L1 and PD-L2 were predominantly in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. Dinaciclib showed no notable effect of PD-1 yet substantially induced the increased levels of PD-L1 and PD-L2.Cyclin E1-driven OvCa is characterized with activated polyamine synthesis, which is associated with decreased cancer immunity. Targeting polyamine and CDK2 may therefore sensitize this genotype to   blockade.© 2019 The Authors.

The standard for determining which patients might benefit from ICB-based therapies is through the assessment of tumor mutational burden using formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor tissue samples; however, this strategy is imperfect. The discovery of exosomal PD-L1 has placed these nano-vesicles to the forefront of immunotherapy biomarker development. Exosomes and other extracellular vesicles contain proteins and nucleic acids specific to their  of origin and their production is increased in disease state such as cancer and can be isolated from most types of liquid biopsy. Given this opportunity, a large-scale bioengineering effort has centered on developing technologies capable of isolating distinct subsets of exosomes and interrogating their content for biomarker discovery.: This review investigates the current state of small extracellular vesicles (sEVs), focusing on exosomes, as they relate to biomarkers of IBC. We will discuss technologies being developed to both capture and evaluate exosomal cargo and as some of the challenges they face.: The advancement of microfluidic technologies, along with rapidly evolving methodologies in RNAseq and proteomics, are making the potential of utilizing exosomes as prognostic and diagnostic biomarkers of ICB into a likely reality.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662794>Prognostic value of PD-L1 expression for surgically treated localized renal  carcinoma: implications for risk stratification and adjuvant therapies.</a></h1><p>We aimed to evaluate the prognostic role of programmed-death receptor ligand (PD-L1) in a multinational cohort of patients with localized renal  carcinoma (RCC).Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded blocks of 1017 patients from the Latin American Renal Cancer Group were analyzed. Tissue microarrays were immunostained for PD-L1 using a commercially available monoclonal antibody. Expression of PD-L1 in ⩾5% tumor cells was considered positive. PD-1 expression in  cells was also assessed. All cases were reviewed twice based on antibody expression and compared with a positive control. Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to identify predictors of recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS).A total of 738 cases with complete follow up met criteria. Median age was 57 [interquartile range (IQR): 49-64] years, and median follow up was 34 (IQR: 15-62.9) months. Median tumor size was 5 cm (IQR: 3.0-7.5 cm). Approximately 8.2% and 7.6% of tumors were PD-L1 and programmed -death 1 (PD-1) positive, respectively. PD-L1 and PD-1 positivity were significantly associated with higher tumor stage (both  < 0.001), and presence of tumor necrosis and lymphovascular multivariable analyses; PD-L1 positivity was found as a predictor of worse RFS [hazard ratio (HR) = 2.08,  = 0.05] and OS (HR = 2.61,  = 0.02).PD-L1 positivity was significantly associated with worse outcomes for patients with localized RCC at intermediate follow up. This marker may help stratify patients for stricter surveillance after surgical treatment and provide a basis for -inhibitor therapy in the adjuvant setting.© The Author(s), 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31651174>PLGA Nanoparticles Codelivering siRNAs against Programmed  Death Protein-1 and Its Ligand Gene for Suppression of Colon Tumor Growth.</a></h1><p>Tumor-infiltrating T lymphocytes highly express programmed  death protein-1 (PD-1) that interacts with its ligand, programmed  death protein ligand-1 (PD-L1) on tumors. PD-1/PD-L1 interactions cause functional exhaustion of effector T cells and impair antitumor immunity, allowing tumors to escape  surveillance. In addition to such extrinsic interactions, tumors proliferate by transmitting intrinsic PD-L1 signals via the mTOR pathway. Here, we simultaneously silenced PD-1 and PD-L1 expressions on CTLs and colon tumors using PD-1 siRNA/PD-L1 siRNA-loaded PLGA nanoparticles and investigated functional activation of tumor-specific CTLs. When compared to a single PD-1 silencing on CTLs or a single PD-L1 silencing on tumors, cosilencing of PD-1/PD-L1 on CTLs and tumors more efficiently promoted effector functions of tumor-specific CTLs. Moreover, PD-L1-silenced tumors inhibited mTOR signaling and showed an antiproliferative response independent of the adaptive  response. Ultimately, systemic administration of PD-1 and PD-L1 siRNA via PLGA nanoparticles restored the effector functions of tumor-specific CTLs in MC38 tumor-bearing mice. Compared with antitumor effects of single silencing of PD-1 or PD-L1 alone, cosilencing of PD-1 and PD-L1 showed more significant tumor growth suppression and long-term tumor inhibition in colon cancer.

Although sorafenib was used in clinical practice as the first molecular targeted agent in 2007, the SHARPE and Asian-Pacific trials demonstrated that sorafenib only improved overall survival (OS) by approximately 3 months in patients with advanced HCC compared with placebo. Molecular targeted agents were developed during the 10-year period from 2007 to 2016, but every test of these agents from phase II or phase III clinical trial failed due to a low response rate and high toxicity. In the 2 years after, 2017 through 2018, four successful novel drugs emerged from clinical trials for clinical use. As recommended by updated Barcelona Clinical Liver cancer (BCLC) treatment algorithms, lenvatinib is now feasible as an alternative to sorafenib as a first-line treatment for advanced HCC. Regorafenib, cabozantinib, and ramucirumab are appropriate supplements for sorafenib as second-line treatment for patients with advanced HCC who are resistant, show progression or do not tolerate sorafenib. In addition, with promising outcomes in phase II trials,  PD-1/PD-L1  inhibitors nivolumab and pembrolizumab have been applied for HCC treatment. Despite phase III trials for nivolumab and pembrolizumab, the primary endpoints of improved OS were not statistically significant,  PD-1/PD-L1  therapy remains to be further investigated.

Distinct from both responses, we experienced a case of non-small  lung cancer (NSCLC) with a pseudo-relapse, in which development of granulation mimicked cancer relapse during nivolumab therapy. A male with advanced NSCLC started nivolumab as a second-line therapy. After 15 cycles of nivolumab with a complete response, tumor markers started increasing and positron-emission computed tomography indicated a hot spot in the sigmoid colon. Laparoscopic segmental sigmoid colon resection revealed granulation tissue without any relapse of malignant cells. The results showed that even if radiographical tumor progression is found during  therapy, histological confirmation should be considered.Copyright© 2019, International Institute of Anticancer Research (Dr. George J.

Blocking the PD-L1/PD-1 pathway has consistently shown remarkable anti-tumor effects in patients with advanced cancers and is recognized as the gold standard for developing new   blockade (ICB) and combination therapies. However, the response rates of anti-PD-L1 have been limited in several solid tumors. Therefore, furthering our understanding of the regulatory mechanisms of PD-L1 can bring substantial benefits to patients with cancer by improving the efficacy of current PD-L1/PD-1 blockade or other ICBs.

However, there are still subsets of patients across multiple cancers not showing robust responses to these agents and one significant barrier to their efficacy may be the recruitment of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) into the tumor microenvironment. In this study, we demonstrated that functional inhibition of MDSCs with (3 R)-5,6,7-trihydroxy-3-isopropyl-3-methylisochroman-1-one (TIMO), a potent PI3Kδ/γ inhibitor, enhanced the therapeutic efficacy of anti-PD1 antibody in the tumor model. A syngeneic ovarian tumor model was established. MDSCs from the peripheral blood and tumor parenchyma were analyzed by flow cytometry. Proliferation and killing effects of T-lymphocytes were measured. IFNγ production was measured by ELISA assay. qPCR and western blot were used to detect the gene and protein expression. Furthermore, the therapeutic effects of TIMO combined with anti-PD1 antibody were assessed by the tumor model. Our data demonstrated that inhibition of granulocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells (G-MDSCs) function with TIMO could overcome MDSCs-mediated immunosuppression and promote antigen-specific T-lymphocyte responses, resulting in the restoration of cytotoxic T -mediated tumor control. We further demonstrated that TIMO and anti-PD1 combination therapy promoted tumor growth control in a syngeneic ovarian tumor model.

Accurate and rapid identification of neoantigens play a pivotal role in cancer immunotherapy. Although several in silico tools for neoantigen prediction have been presented, limitations of these tools exist.We developed pTuneos, a computational pipeline for prioritizing tumor neoantigens from next-generation sequencing data. We tested the performance of pTuneos on the melanoma cancer vaccine cohort data and tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL)-recognized neopeptide data. pTuneos is able to predict the MHC presentation and T  recognition ability of the candidate neoantigens, and the actual immunogenicity of single-nucleotide variant (SNV)-based neopeptides considering their natural processing and presentation, surpassing the existing tools with a comprehensive and quantitative benchmark of their neoantigen prioritization performance and running time. pTuneos was further tested on The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cohort data as well as the melanoma and non-small  lung cancer (NSCLC) cohort data undergoing  blockade immunotherapy. The overall neoantigen immunogenicity score proposed by pTuneos is demonstrated to be a powerful and pan-cancer marker for survival prediction compared to traditional well-established biomarkers.In summary, pTuneos provides the state-of-the-art one-stop and user-friendly solution for prioritizing SNV-based candidate neoepitopes, which could help to advance research on next-generation cancer immunotherapies and personalized cancer vaccines. pTuneos is available at https://github.com/bm2-lab/pTuneos , with a Docker version for quick deployment at https://cloud.docker.com/u/bm2lab/repository/docker/bm2lab/ptuneos .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694167> and Inflammatory Cells of the Tumor Microenvironment Represent Novel Therapeutic Targets in Classical Hodgkin Lymphoma.</a></h1><p>Classical Hodgkin Lymphoma (cHL) is a B- malignancy that, typically, responds well to standard therapies. However, patients who relapse after standard regimens or are refractory to induction therapy have a dismal outcome. The implementation of novel therapies such as the anti-CD30 monoclonal antibody Brentuximab Vedotin and   inhibitors has provided curative options for many of these patients. Nonetheless, responses are rarely durable, emphasizing the need for new agents. cHL is characterized by a unique microenvironment in which cellular and humoral components interact to promote tumor survival and dissemination. Knowledge of the complex composition of cHL microenvironment is constantly evolving; in particular, there is growing interest in certain  subsets such as tumor-associated macrophages, myeloid-derived suppressor cells and neutrophils, all of which have a relevant role in the pathogenesis of the disease. The unique biology of the cHL microenvironment has provided opportunities to develop new drugs, many of which are currently being tested in preclinical and clinical settings.

Detection of this malignancy is delayed due to the lack of symptoms in the early-stage cancer, which makes it extremely difficult to treat. Identifying effective strategies has been a challenge for improving the survival rates in pancreatic cancer patients. Resistance to chemotherapy is often developed in pancreatic cancer treatment. Although many strategies are under clinical trials to target certain markers associated with cancer, immunotherapeutic approaches are currently gaining importance. Immunotherapy for pancreatic cancer is in the limelight after preclinical research showed some promise. Immunotherapy approaches were tested along with other treatment options to enhance the treatment effect. Adoptive  transfer and   inhibitors are currently in clinical trials. The Food and Drug Administration approved pembrolizumab in a fast-tracked review for advanced pancreatic cancer patients. Pembrolizumab blocks the  protein, programmed  death protein 1 (PD-1), on T cells to boost the response of the  system against cancer cells, thereby shrinking tumors. The recent developments in immunotherapy and the early success in other cancers are encouraging to further test immunotherapy in pancreatic cancer. The combination of pembrolizumab and pelareorep, an isolate of human reovirus, is in phase II clinical study in metastatic disease. Depending on the results of current clinical trials and testing, the strategies in the pipeline are expected to increase the use of immunotherapy in the clinical testing setting.

Baseline serum creatinine, averaged 6 months before  inhibitor start date, was compared with all subsequent creatinine values within 12 months of starting therapy. AKI was defined by Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes criteria for fold changes in creatinine from baseline. Sustained AKI events lasted at least 3 days and was our primary outcome. The cause of sustained AKI was determined by chart review. Cumulative incidence and subdistribution hazard models were used to assess the relationship between baseline demographics, comorbidities, and medications, and sustained AKI and potential  inhibitor-related AKI.We included 1016 patients in the analysis. Average age was 63 (SD 13) years, 61% were men, and 91% were white. Mean baseline creatinine was 0.9 mg/dl (SD 0.4 mg/dl), and 169 (17%) had CKD (eGFR<60 ml/min per 1.73 m) at baseline. A total of 169 patients (17%) experienced AKI, defined by an increase in creatinine at least 1.5 times the baseline within 12 months; 82 patients (8%) experienced sustained AKI and 30 patients (3%) had potential  inhibitor-related AKI. The first episode of sustained AKI occurred, on average, 106 days (SD 85) after  inhibitor initiation. Sixteen (2%) patients experienced stage 3 sustained AKI and four patients required dialysis. Proton pump inhibitor use at baseline was associated with sustained AKI.AKI is common in patients receiving  inhibitor therapy.

MW11-h317 can effectively induce T--mediated  response and inhibit tumor growth in mouse model. Crystal structure of PD-1/MW11-h317 Fab complex reveals that both the loops and glycosylation of PD-1 are involved in recognition and binding, in which Asn58 glycosylation plays a critical role. The unique glycan epitope in PD-1 to MW11-h317 is different from the first two approved clinical PD-1 antibodies, nivolumab and pembrolizumab.

Multiple lines of evidence suggest that, in this setting, the vision of a single biomarker is somewhat naïve and imprecise, given that immunotherapy does not follow the rules that we have experienced in the past for targeted therapies. On the other hand, additional -related biomarkers that are reliable in real-life clinical practice remain to be identified. Recently, the - blockade has been approved in the US irrespective of the tumor site of origin. Further histology-agnostic approvals, coupled with with tumor-specific companion diagnostics and guidelines, are expected in this field. In addition, -related biomarkers can also have a significant prognostic value. In this review, we provide an overview of the role of these biomarkers and their characterization in the management of lung cancer, melanoma, colorectal cancer, gastric cancer, head and neck cancer, renal  carcinoma, urothelial cancers, and breast cancer.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31653980> subtyping of extranodal NK/T- lymphoma: a new biomarker and an  shift during disease progression.</a></h1><p>Extranodal NK/T- lymphoma is an aggressive lymphoma that is strongly associated with Epstein-Barr virus infection. Although some extranodal NK/T- lymphoma patients have shown responses to   blockade, biomarkers for predicting extranodal NK/T- lymphoma patient response to immunotherapy have not yet been defined. To understand the tumor  microenvironment, we analyzed the expression of 579 -related genes and characterized the  cells using immunohistochemistries and in situ hybridization for EBER. Based on comprehensive analyses, we developed an  subtyping model that classifies extranodal NK/T- lymphoma patients into four tumor  microenvironment subgroups using three immunohistochemical markers (FoxP3, PD-L1, and CD68). The four tumor  microenvironment subgroups were named  tolerance,  evasion-A,  evasion-B, and  silenced. The  tolerance group was characterized by high-Treg counts and was frequently observed in early stage, and nasal extranodal NK/T- lymphoma. The  evasion group showed high cytotoxic T- counts and high PD-L1 expression but low Treg counts. In the -silenced group, almost all  responses were exhausted, most patients were at an advanced stage, and had the poorest disease prognosis among the tumor  microenvironment subgroups. In some patients (n = 3), a shift in the tumor  microenvironment subgroup classification was observed in sequential biopsies. The response rate to pembrolizumab, an anti-PD-1 antibody, was 100% (1/1) in the  tolerance group, 60% (3/5) in the  evasion group, and 0% (0/5) in the -silenced group. We classified extranodal NK/T- lymphoma into four tumor  microenvironment subgroups using a new classification system. In conclusion, we propose that the tumor  microenvironment of extranodal NK/T- lymphoma may change during disease progression and may serve as a useful biomarker for immunotherapy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652644>MPT0G612, a Novel HDAC6 Inhibitor, Induces Apoptosis and Suppresses IFN-γ-Induced Programmed Death-Ligand 1 in Human Colorectal Carcinoma Cells.</a></h1><p>Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer and the leading cause of cancer-associated death worldwide. Histone deacetylases (HDACs) have been implicated in regulating complex cellular mechanisms to influence tumor biology and immunogenicity in various types of cancer. The potential of selective inhibition of HDAC6 has been widely discussed for the treatment of hematologic malignancies. We previously identified that MPT0G612 is a novel HDAC6 inhibitor exhibiting a promising antitumor activity against several solid tumors. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the feasibility and pharmacological mechanisms of MPT0G612 as a potential therapy for CRC patients. Results revealed that MPT0G612 significantly suppresses the proliferation and viability, as well as induces apoptosis in CRC cells. Autophagy activation with LC3B-II formation and p62 degradation was observed, and the inhibition of autophagy by pharmacological inhibitor or Atg5 knockdown enhances MPT0G612-induced  death. In addition, HDAC6 knockdown reduces MPT0G612-mediated autophagy and further potentiates apoptotic  death. Furthermore, MPT0G612 downregulates the expression of PD-L1 induced by IFN-γ in CRC cells. These results suggest that MPT0G612 is a potent  death inducer through inhibiting HDAC6-associated pathway, and a potential agent for combination strategy with   inhibitors for the treatment of CRC.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693178>The landscape of   inhibitor plus chemotherapy versus immunotherapy for advanced non-small- lung cancer: A systematic review and meta-analysis.</a></h1><p>Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide and the prognosis remains poor. The recent introduction of the   inhibitor (ICI), or plus chemotherapy, both resulted in the survival benefit for patients with advanced non-small- lung cancer (NSCLC), but it remains unanswered which is superior. The current study aimed to estimate the comparative efficacy and safety of ICI-chemotherapy versus ICI-monotherapy in advanced NSCLC.Studies were identified by searching PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane library. The randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that ICI monotherapy or ICI plus chemotherapy compared with chemotherapy in NSCLC were included with available primary endpoints of progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), objective response rate, or treatment-related adverse events. A fixed-effect or random-effects model was adopted depending on between-study heterogeneity.A total of 20 RCTs involving 12,025 patients with NSCLC were included. Both ICI-monotherapy and ICI-chemotherapy resulted in significantly prolonged survival compared to chemotherapy and the former led to significantly longer PFS. The magnitude of survival benefits appeared to be greatest among those treated with pembrolizumab plus platinum-based chemotherapy (OS, 0.56; PFS, 0.54). Additionally, OS and PFS advantages of ICI therapies were observed in patients with NSCLC with low or high programmed  death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression level, but not in intermediate PD-L1 TPS.Pembrolizumab plus platinum-based chemotherapy was recommended as the optimal first-line therapy for advanced patients with NSCLC. Additionally, PD-L1 alone is not recommended as an adequate molecular biomarker to identify eligible patients for routine clinical practice in immunotherapy.© 2019 The Authors.

It acts as myeloid   and thus has prognostic and therapeutic implications.: This review presents and discusses the currently available data on the prognostic role and therapeutic value of CD47 in gastrointestinal tumors.: CD47 is overexpressed on the great majority of gastrointestinal tumors, cancer stem cells and circulating tumor cells. Overexpression of CD47 usually predicts a negative prognosis and seems to contribute to cancer  evasion. The inhibition of CD47 has shown impressive results in clinical trials in hematologic malignancies, however, for gastrointestinal tumors only preclinical data is available. Inhibition of this myeloid   may yield great clinical benefit due to the abundance of myeloid effector cells. However, due to the ubiquitous expression of CD47 and the resulting antigen sink, vast amounts of antibody are required in order to reach therapeutic concentrations. QPCTL inhibitors, blocking post-translational modification of CD47 protein may be a solution to this problem.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671314>Real-life results from the overall population and key subgroups within the Italian cohort of nivolumab expanded access program in non-squamous non-small  lung cancer.</a></h1><p>Nivolumab was the first   inhibitor approved for previously treated advanced non-small  lung cancer (NSCLC). Before its introduction in the market, nivolumab was made available to NSCLC patients through an expanded access program (EAP). Here we present the Italian cohort of patients with non-squamous NSCLC enrolled in a worldwide nivolumab EAP, with subgroup analyses involving elderly patients, patients with central nervous system (CNS) metastases and patients receiving nivolumab beyond progression.Pretreated patients with advanced non-squamous NSCLC received nivolumab at 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks up to 24 months. Efficacy data (investigator-assessed tumour response, progression date and survival) and safety data were collected.1588 patients were treated across 153 Italian centres. Overall response rate and disease control rate were 18% and 44%, respectively; median overall survival (OS) was 11.3 months (95% CI: 10.2-12.4). Elderly patients (≥70 n = 522; ≥75 n = 232) achieved outcomes similar to the global study population; patients with CNS metastases (n = 409) had an OS of 8.6 months (95% CI: 6.4-10.8), and a 1-year OS rate of 43%. Nivolumab was administered beyond progression to 276 patients (26%), 57 of whom achieved subsequent disease control; the median OS of patients receiving nivolumab beyond progression was 16.2 months (95% CI: 14.0-18.4), while 1-year OS rate was 62%.To date, this is the largest clinical experience with nivolumab in a real-world setting. Our data support its use in clinical practice for pretreated non-squamous NSCLC, including patients with older age or CNS metastases.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Two of these phase III randomized trials showed that the anti-PD1 antibodies nivolumab and pembrolizumab were superior to investigators' choice chemotherapy in second-line platinum-refractory R/M HNSCC. Recently, a third phase III randomized trial, KEYNOTE-048, showed that pembrolizumab with chemotherapy was superior to the EXTREME regimen (cis- or carboplatin, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and cetuximab) in all patients, and pembrolizumab monotherapy was superior in patients whose tumors express PD-L1 in first-line R/M HNSCC. Pembrolizumab is now approved as monotherapy in PD-L1 expressing disease (combined positive score ≥1) or in combination with chemotherapy for all patients with R/M HNSCC. Thus, PD-L1 biomarker testing will be routinely used in R/M HNSCC, and this employs a scoring system that incorporates   staining, referred to as the combined positive score (CPS). Additionally, for the 85% of patients with PD-L1 CPS ≥1, clinical judgment will guide the choice of pembrolizumab monotherapy or pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy, until more detailed clinical data are forthcoming to better inform this decision. In this article we discuss the clinical trials leading to these therapeutic advances and we will review initial results from clinical trials in previously untreated, locally advanced disease, and those using novel combinations of  inhibitors, co-stimulatory agonists, and therapeutic vaccines.Copyright © 2019.

Higher serum vitamin D is associated with thinner primary melanoma and better outcome, although a causal mechanism has not been established. As melanoma patients commonly avoid sun exposure, and consequent vitamin D deficiency might worsen outcomes, we interrogated 703 primary melanoma transcriptomes to understand the role of vitamin D-VDR signalling and replicated the findings in TCGA metastases. VDR expression was independently protective for melanoma death in both primary and metastatic disease. High tumor VDR expression was associated with upregulation of pathways mediating anti-tumor immunity and correspondingly with higher imputed   scores and histologically detected tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). High VDR expressing tumors had downregulation of proliferative pathways, notably Wnt/beta-catenin signaling. Deleterious low VDR levels resulted from promoter methylation and gene deletion in metastases. Vitamin D deficiency (< 25 nmol/l ~ 10 ng/ml) shortened survival in primary melanoma in a VDR-dependent manner. In vitro functional validation studies showed that elevated vitamin D-VDR signaling inhibited Wnt/beta-catenin signaling genes. Murine melanoma cells overexpressing VDR produced fewer pulmonary metastases than controls in tail vein metastasis assays. In summary, vitamin D-VDR signaling contributes to controlling pro-proliferative/immunosuppresive Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in melanoma and this is associated with less metastatic disease and stronger host  responses. This is evidence of the causal relationship between vitamin D-VDR signaling and melanoma survival which should be explored as a therapeutic target in primary resistance to  blockade.Copyright ©2019, American Association for Cancer Research.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652269>Monitoring and characterizing soluble and membrane-bound ectonucleotidases CD73 and CD39.</a></h1><p>The success of immunotherapy treatment in oncology ushered a new modality for treating a wide variety of cancers. However, lack of effect in some patients made it imperative to identify other pathways that are exploited by cancer cells to circumvent  surveillance, and possibly synergize   treatment in those cases. It has been recently recognized that adenosine levels increase significantly in the tumor microenvironment and that adenosine/adenosine receptors play a powerful role as immunosuppressive and attenuating several effector T  functions. The two main enzymes responsible for generating adenosine in the microenvironment are the ectonucleotidases CD39 and CD73, the former utilizes both ATP and ADP and produces AMP while the latter utilizes AMP and generates adenosine. Thus, these two enzymes combined are the major source for the bulk of adenosine produced in the microenvironment. They were shown to be validated targets in oncology leading to several clinical trials that include small molecules as well as antibodies, showing positive and encouraging results in the preclinical arena. Towards the development of novel drugs to target these enzymes, we have developed a platform that can be utilized to monitor the activities of both enzymes in vitro (biochemical) as well as in cells ( based) assays. We have developed very sensitive and homogenous assays that enabled us to monitor the activity of both enzymes and demonstrate selectivity of known inhibitors as well as monoclonal antibodies. This should speed up screening for novel inhibitors that might lead to more effective cancer therapy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31656782>Biomarkers in metastatic renal  carcinoma in the era of   inhibitors.</a></h1><p></p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652645>Epigenetic Reprogramming for Targeting -Mutant Malignant Gliomas.</a></h1><p>Targeting the epigenome has been considered a compelling treatment modality for several cancers, including gliomas. Nearly 80% of the lower-grade gliomas and secondary glioblastomas harbor recurrent mutations in isocitrate dehydrogenase (). Mutant IDH generates high levels of 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) that inhibit various components of the epigenetic machinery, including histone and DNA demethylases. The encouraging results from current epigenetic therapies in hematological malignancies have reinvigorated the interest in solid tumors and gliomas, both preclinically and clinically. Here, we summarize the recent advancements in epigenetic therapy for lower-grade gliomas and discuss the challenges associated with current treatment options. A particular focus is placed on therapeutic mechanisms underlying favorable outcome with epigenetic-based drugs in basic and translational research of gliomas. This review also highlights emerging bridges to combination treatment with respect to epigenetic drugs. Given that epigenetic therapies, particularly DNA methylation inhibitors, increase tumor immunogenicity and antitumor  responses, appropriate drug combinations with   inhibitors may lead to improvement of treatment effectiveness of immunotherapy, ultimately leading to tumor  eradication.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31648184>  inhibitor-associated thyroid dysfunction: a disproportionality analysis using the WHO adverse drug reaction database VigiBase.</a></h1><p>Our study aimed to identify and characterize thyroid dysfunctions associated with immume  inhibitors (ICIs).Data were obtained from VigiBase, between January 1, 2011 to March 6, 2019.All thyroid drug-adverse events are classified by group queries according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities. Information component (IC) and reporting odds ratio (ROR) were considered as measures of disproportionality for the assessment of association between ICIs and thyroid dysfunctions. We used IC to identify meaningful drug-adverse events while using ROR to compare differences in the reporting of drug-adverse events caused by different ICI subgroups. Positive IC values are deemed significant.Compared with the full database, the following ICI-associated thyroid dysfunctions were over-reported: hypothyroidism (1125 reports for ICIs vs 12495 for all drugs; Information Component 4.28 [95% CI 4.18-4.35]), hyperthyroidism (926 vs 7538; 4.66 [95% CI 4.55-4.74]), thyroiditis (294 vs 1237; 5.40 [95% CI 5.21-5.54]), thyrotoxic crisis (11 vs 288; 3.55 [95% CI 2.61-4.20]). Hypothyroidism was over-reported for patients treated with ICI combination therapy versus those treated with ICI monotherapy (ROR 1.3 [95% CI 1.1-1.7]), and the same was observed for hyperthyroidism (ROR 1.9 [95% CI 1.5-2.4]), thyroiditis (ROR 3.3 [95% CI 2.3-4.8]), thyrotoxic crisis (ROR 11.5 [95% CI 2.4-53.8]). All 11 thyrotoxic crisis cases were malignant melanoma patients, of which 7 occurred under ICI combination therapy.Thyroid dysfunction may occur after ICI therapies, and severe thyrotoxic crisis may even occurs.

Targeting - inhibitors represents a standard option for advanced NSCLC. Improvements in understanding of the  profile of NSCLC has led to the development of immunotherapeutic strategies, including inhibitory molecules responsible for abrogating an anticancer  response such as programmed -death 1 and programmed -death ligand 1. A recently published phase III trial (PACIFIC) showed for the first time an improved overall survival in stage III NSCLC patients with consolidative durvalumab.

However, its therapeutic mechanism of action (MOA) remains unclear, with antitumor responses to Trastuzumab remaining heterologous and metastatic HER2+ BC remaining incurable. Consequently, understanding its MOA could enable rational strategies to enhance its efficacy. Using both novel murine and human versions of Trastuzumab, we found its antitumor activity dependent on Fcγ-Receptor stimulation of tumor-associated-macrophages (TAM) and Antibody-Dependent-Cellular-Phagocytosis (ADCP), but not cytotoxicity (ADCC). Trastuzumab also stimulated TAM activation and expansion, but did not require adaptive immunity, natural killer cells, and/or neutrophils. Moreover, inhibition of the innate  ADCP , CD47, significantly enhanced Trastuzumab-mediated ADCP, TAM expansion and activation, resulting in the emergence of a unique hyper-phagocytic macrophage population, improved antitumor responses and prolonged survival. In addition, we found tumor-associated CD47 expression was inversely associated with survival in HER2+ BC patients and that human HER2+ BC xenografts treated with Trastuzumab+CD47 inhibition underwent complete tumor regression. Collectively, our study identifies Trastuzumab-mediated ADCP as a significant antitumor MOA that may be clinically enabled by CD47 blockade to augment therapeutic efficacy.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672768>How to Train your T cells: Overcoming  Dysfunction in Multiple Myeloma.</a></h1><p>The progression of multiple myeloma (MM), a hematologic malignancy characterized by unregulated plasma  growth, is associated with increasing innate and adaptive  system dysfunction, notably in the T- repertoire. Although treatment advances in MM have led to deeper and more durable clinical responses, the disease remains incurable for most patients. Therapeutic strategies aimed at overcoming the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and activating the host  system have recently shown promise in MM, particularly in the relapsed and/or refractory disease setting. As the efficacy of T--dependent immuno-oncology therapy is likely affected by the health of the endogenous T- repertoire, these therapies may also provide benefit in alternate treatment settings (e.g., precursor disease; after stem  transplantation). This review describes T--associated changes during the evolution of MM and provides an overview of T--dependent immuno-oncology approaches under investigation. Vaccine and  inhibitor interventions are being explored across the MM disease continuum; treatment modalities that redirect patient T cells to elicit an anti-MM response, namely chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells and bispecific antibodies (including BiTE [bispecific T- engager] molecules), have been primarily evaluated to date in the relapsed and/or refractory disease setting. CAR T cells and bispecific antibodies/antibody constructs directed against B- maturation antigen (BCMA) have generated excitement, with clinical data demonstrating deep responses. An increased understanding of the complex interplay between the  system and MM throughout the disease course will aid in maximizing the potential for T--dependent immuno-oncology strategies in MM.Copyright ©2019, American Association for Cancer Research.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31684954>The tumor inflammation signature (TIS) is associated with anti-PD-1 treatment benefit in the CERTIM pan-cancer cohort.</a></h1><p>The 18-gene tumor inflammation signature (TIS) is a clinical research assay that enriches for clinical benefit to   blockade. We evaluated its ability to predict clinical benefit of immunotherapy in cancer patients treated with PD-1  inhibitors in routine clinical care.The CERTIM cohort is a prospective cohort which includes patients receiving   inhibitors in Cochin University hospital. RNA extracted from 58 archival formalin fixed paraffin embedded tumor blocks (including 38 lung cancers, 5 melanomas, 10 renal carcinomas, 4 urothelial carcinomas and 1 colon carcinoma) was hybridized to a beta version of the NanoString PanCancer IO360™ CodeSet using nCounter technology. Gene expression signatures were correlated with tumor responses (by RECIST criteria) and overall survival. PD-L1 immunostaining on tumor cells was assessed in 37 non-small  lung cancer (NSCLC) samples and tumor mutational burden (TMB) measured by whole exome sequencing in 19 of these.TIS scores were significantly associated with complete or partial response to anti-PD-1 treatment in the whole cohort (odds ratio = 2.64, 95% CI [1.4; 6.0], p = 0.008), as well as in the NSCLC population (odds ratio = 3.27, 95% CI [1.2; 11.6], p = 0.03). Patients whose tumor had a high TIS score (upper tertile) showed prolonged overall survival compared to patients whose tumor had lower TIS scores, both in the whole cohort (hazard ratio = 0.37, 95% CI [0.18, 0.76], p = 0.005) and in the NSCLC population (hazard ratio = 0.36, 95% CI [0.14, 0.90], p = 0.02). In the latter, the TIS score was independent from either PD-L1 staining on tumor cells (spearman coefficient 0.2) and TMB (spearman coefficient - 0.2).These results indicate that validated gene expression assay measuring the level of tumor microenvironment inflammation such as TIS, are accurate and independent predictive biomarkers and can be easily implemented in the clinical practice.</p></html>
