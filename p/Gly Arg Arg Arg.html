We analyzed effects of body weight (BW) and gestational period on nutrient composition in fetal Huanjiang mini-pigs. Fetuses with the lowest BW (LBW), middle BW (MBW), and highest BW (HBW) were collected at days 45, 75, and 110 of gestation. Crude protein (CP), crude fat, amino acid (AA), and  acid (FA) concentrations were determined. The BW gain, carcass weight, fat percentage, and uterus weight of sows increased as gestation progressed, as did litter weight, average individual fetal weight, fetal body weight, and dry matter (DM). The concentrations of Ala, , crude fat, , Pro, Tyr, C14:0, C16:0, C16:1, C18:1n9c, C18:2n6c, C18:3n3, C18:3n6, C20:0, C20:3n6, saturated FA (SFA), and monounsaturated FA (MUFA) increased significantly as gestation progressed. The percentage of skeleton, and the ratio of the , lung, and stomach to BW decreased as gestation progressed. There were also significant reductions in the concentrations of CP, Asp, Glu, His, Ile, Leu, Lys, Phe, Ser, Thr, essential AA (EAA), acidic AA, C17:0, C20:4n6, C22:6n3, unsaturated FA (UFA), polyunsaturated FA (PUFA), n-3PUFA, n-6PUFA as gestation progressed, and reductions in EAA/total AA (TAA), PUFA/SFA, and n-3/n-6 PUFA. The LBW fetuses exhibited the lowest BW and crude fat, C14:0, C16:1, C17:0, C18:2n6c, and MUFA concentrations at days 75 and 110 of gestation. They also exhibited lower Tyr concentration at day 45 of gestation and lower Glu concentration at day 75 of gestation than HBW fetuses. These findings suggest that LBW fetuses exhibit lower amounts of crude fat and several FAs during mid-gestation and late-gestation, which may in turn affect adaptability, growth, and development.</p><p>Keyword:['fatty liver']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27143603>Characterization and functional analysis of  acid binding protein from the carcinogenic  fluke, Opisthorchis viverrini.</a></h2><p>In the present study, the cDNA encoding FABP (Ov-FABP) was isolated from the adult stage of Opisthorchis viverrini and characterized. The Ov-FABP protein sequence (107 amino acids) was predicted to have a molecular mass of 12.26kDa and an isoelectric point (PI) of 6.82. This sequence had a high identity and similarity to Cs-FABP of the related opisthorchid Clonorchis sinensis. Multiple sequence alignment with FABPs from other parasitic flatworms and mammals showed a number of conserved amino acids including Phe, , Glu, Glu,Val, Iso, , Ile, Ser and . In addition, the structure of Ov-FABP was predicted to have eleven β-sheets and one α-helix based on the known structures for FABPs from human (hL-FABP), rat and a schistosome. Phylogenetic analysis of amino acid sequence data revealed a close relationship of Ov-FABP with Cs-FABP and hL-FABP. Reverse transcription-PCR revealed that Ov-FABP was transcribed in the egg, metacercaria, juvenile and adult stages. The soluble form of recombinant Ov-FABP (rOv-FABP) was shown to specifically bind  acids, including oleic acid, palmitic acid and linoleic acid, as shown for other animals. Anti-serum against rOv-FABP (produced in mice) located the protein to parenchyma, egg, sucker musculature, testes and tegument of adult O. viverrini. Taken together, the findings suggest key functional roles for Ov-FABP in development, reproduction and/or host-parasite interactions.Copyright © 2016 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

A single-nucleotide polymorphism leading to a glutamine () by arginine () substitution at codon 460 of the purinergic P2X7 receptor (P2X7R) has been associated with mood disorders. No change in function (loss or gain) has been described for this SNP so far. Here we show that although the P2X7R-Gln460Arg variant per se is not compromised in its function, co-expression of wild-type P2X7R with P2X7R-Gln460Arg impairs receptor function with respect to calcium influx, channel currents and intracellular signaling in vitro. Moreover, co-immunoprecipitation and FRET studies show that the P2X7R-Gln460Arg variant physically interacts with P2X7R-WT. Specific silencing of either the normal or polymorphic variant rescues the heterozygous loss of function phenotype and restores normal function. The described loss of function due to co-expression, unique for mutations in the P2RX7 gene so far, explains the mechanism by which the P2X7R-Gln460Arg variant affects the normal function of the channel and may represent a mechanism of action for other mutations.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29356900>Structural insights on bioremediation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons using microalgae: a modelling-based computational study.</a></h2><p>Research on bioremediation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) has established that several remediating microbial species are capable of degrading only low molecular weight (LMW)-PAHs, whereas high molecular weight (HMW)-PAHs are hardly degradable. In the present study, the efficiency of degradation of both LMW and HMW-PAHs by cytochrome P450 monooxygenase (CYP) of microalgae was studied. CYP have a key role in the detoxification of xenobiotics. So far, the structure of CYP in microalgae is not predicted; the protein structure was constructed by molecular modelling in the current study using the available template of microalgal CYP. Modelled microalgae 3D structures were docked against 38 different PAH compounds, and the information regarding the interaction between protein and PAHs viz. binding sites along with mode of interactions was investigated. We report that CYP from the microalgae Haematococcus pluvialis and Parachlorella kessleri was found to possess broad oxidising capability towards both LMW and HMW-PAHs. P. kessleri showed a least value with extra precision glide score of - 10.23 and glide  of - 23.48 kcal/mol. PAHs bind to CYP active sites at Lys , Trp ,   and   through intermolecular hydrogen bonding. Also, study revealed that PAHs interacted with CYP active sites through intermolecular hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic bonding, π-π interactions and van der waals interactions. Thus, structural elucidation study confirms that microalgae Parachlorella kessleri have the capacity to remediate HMW more efficiently than other microorganisms. Our results provide a framework in understanding the structure and the possible binding sites of CYP protein for degradation of PAH and that could be a screening tool in identifying the phycoremediation potential.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26262824>Adsorption of Modified , Lys, Asp, and  to Dry and Hydrated ZnO Surface: A Density Functional Theory Study.</a></h2><p>The interface of biological molecules with inorganic surfaces has been the subject of several recent studies.

New evidence of XPA's existence as a dimer and the redefinition of its DNA-binding domain (DBD) raises new questions regarding the stability and functional position of XPA in NER. Here, we have investigated XPA's dimeric status with respect to its previously defined DBD (XPA) as well as with its redefined DBD (XPA). We studied the stability of XPA and XPA homo-dimer systems using all-atom molecular dynamics simulation, and we have also characterized the protein-protein interactions (PPI) of these two homo-dimeric forms of XPA. After conducting the root mean square deviation (RMSD) analyses, it was observed that the XPA homo-dimer has better stability than XPA. It was also found that XPA has a larger number of hydrogen bonds, salt bridges, and hydrophobic interactions than the XPA homo-dimer. We further found that Lys, Glu, , Asn, and  residues shared the major contribution toward the intermolecular interactions in XPA homo-dimers. The binding free  (BFE) analysis, which used the molecular mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann method (MM-PBSA) and the generalized Born and surface area continuum solvation model (GBSA) for both XPA homo-dimers, also substantiated the positive result in favor of the stability of the XPA homo-dimer.

Optimized structures of the 1:1 complexes and ΔHbinding for calcium binding as calculated by density functional theory (DFT) confirmed in all complexes a stronger calcium binding and shorter calcium- bond length in the deprotonated form. In addition, the stronger calcium binding was also accompanied by a binding site shift from carboxylate binding to chelation by α-amino group and carboxylate  for leucine, aspartate, glutamate, alanine, and asparagine. For binary amino acid mixtures, the calcium-binding constant was close to the predicted geometric mean of the individual amino acid binding constants indicating separate binding of calcium to two amino acids when present together in solution. At high pH, corresponding to conditions for calcium absorption, the binding affinity increased in the order Lys <  < Cys <  < Gly ∼ Ala < Asn < His < Leu < Glu< Asp. In a series of glycine peptides, calcium-binding affinity was found to increase in the order Gly-Leu ∼ Gly-Gly < Ala-Gly < Gly-His ∼ Gly-Lys-Gly < Glu-Cys-Gly < Gly-Glu, an ordering confirmed by DFT calculations for the dipeptides and which also accounted for large synergistic effects in calcium binding for up to 6 kJ/mol when compared to the corresponding amino acid mixtures.</p><p>Keyword:['oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28507948>Characterizing the Hot Spots Involved in RON-MSPβ Complex Formation Using  Alanine Scanning Mutagenesis and Molecular Dynamics Simulation.</a></h2><p> Implication of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) in development of many diseases such as cancer makes them attractive for therapeutic intervention and rational drug design.

A molecule able to recognize cardiomyocytes would have significant value in diagnosis and treatment. Recently a novel peptide termed myocyte targeting peptide (MTP), with three residues of a non-natural amino acid biphenylalanine (Bip), showed good affinity to cardiomyocytes. Its selectivity towards cardiac tissues was concluded to be due to the ability of Bip to bind cardiac troponin I. With the aim of optimizing the affinity and the specificity towards cardiac myocytes and to better understand structure-activity relationship, a library of MTP derivatives was designed.

Saxatilin, a snake venom disintegrin containing the --Asp (RGD) motif, exerts thrombolytic and antiplatelet effects by interacting with multiple integrins on platelets. Integrin signalling is indispensable for regulation of endothelial permeability. Saxatilin may play a role in vascular leakage after ischaemia because it has high affinity for endothelial integrins. Here, we determined whether Fc-saxatilin, an Fc-fusion protein of saxatilin, could prevent vascular leakage under hypoxic or ischaemic conditions. In mouse brain microvascular endothelial cells, hypoxia increased the permeability to FITC-dextran, and this effect was attenuated by Fc-saxatilin treatment. Fc-saxatilin also blocked vascular leakage of Evans Blue in the ischaemic brain induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion in mice. Furthermore, the expression of occludin, a   protein, was reduced by hypoxia in endothelial cells. This downregulation of occludin was attenuated by Fc-saxatilin treatment. We also determined the activity of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) 2 and 9 because they are implicated in the degradation of occludin and of the microvascular basal lamina. Hypoxia increased MMP-9 activity, and this increase was attenuated by Fc-saxatilin treatment. Fc-saxatilin specifically bound to integrin αβ of the endothelial cells and inhibited hypoxia-induced activation of FAK, a downstream signalling molecule in integrin-dependent signal transduction. Taken together, these results provide new insights into the mechanism via which Fc-saxatilin, as an integrin antagonist, prevents vascular leakage under ischemic conditions by regulating occludin expression in endothelial  junctions.</p><p>Keyword:['tight junction']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27431272>Protection of rat liver against hepatic ischemia-reperfusion injury by a novel selenocysteine-containing 7-mer peptide.</a></h2><p>Hepatic ischemia-reperfusion (I-R) injury causes acute organ damage or dysfunction, and remains a problem for liver transplantation.

The 7‑mer peptide significantly inhibited the increase in serum hepatic amino‑transferases, tissue malondialdehyde, nitric oxide contents, myeloperoxidase activity and decrease of GPX activity compared with I‑R tissue. Following treatment with the 7‑mer peptide, the expression of B‑cell CLL/lymphoma‑2 (Bcl‑2) was significantly upregulated at the mRNA and protein level compared with the I‑R group, as determined by reverse transcription‑polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry, respectively.

In addition, both peptidases were specifically immunoprecipitated by monoclonal antibodies anti-CD 13 and anti-CD 26 from plasma membranes. Cell surface proteolytic activities were also investigated in human fibroblasts derived from dermatological and rheumatic diseases (i.e., , rheumatoid arthritis, and lichen planus). It was found that these fibroblasts also expressed both types of proteinases initially identified on normal skin fibroblasts and that the levels of Ala-aminopeptidase activities were similar in all cases. In contrast, the levels of -, Leu-exoaminopeptidase, and DPP IV activities were significantly higher (up to 6.6-fold) in the three pathological fibroblast populations than in their normal counterparts.

It is not known what type of Fn is present in psoriatic skin, however, and how this Fn may regulate signaling. Embryonic forms of cellular Fn containing extra domains, designated EDA and EDB, are generated by alternative splicing and are seen in proliferating, developing tissue and in wound healing. Because the EDA segment enhances the integrin binding sequence , , Asp (RGD), which, when present, has been shown to be critical in integrin-extracellular matrix signaling, we were particularly interested in determining whether or not EDA-containing Fn (EDA+Fn) represented the aberrantly expressed Fn in . Increased EDA+ Fn protein was demonstrated by immunostaining at the dermal-epidermal junction in clinically uninvolved skin from six of six patients with , but not in skin from control subjects. Using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction an increased ratio of EDA+ Fn versus EDA- Fn mRNA was present in epidermal samples from psoriatic but not control individuals. Interestingly, the EDA+Fn in the psoriatic epidermis had the IIICS region spliced out (EDA+, FDB-, IIICS-, III9+), which was shared with normal epidermis (EDA-, EDB-, IIICS-, III9+). These results suggest a selective predominance of the EDA+ Fn isoform at the dermal-epidermal junction of psoriatic skin. The consistent aberrant localization of EDA+ Fn at the dermal-epidermal junction in uninvolved skin of psoriatics may confer the hyperresponsiveness of psoriatic uninvolved basal keratinocytes for rapid cellular proliferation in response to T cell signals.

In the current study, we hypothesized that the different ligand-decoration procedures might affect the extent of interaction between nanoparticles and immune cells (especially phagocytes). In order to investigate our hypothesis, we decorated lipidic nanoparticles with a widely used cyclic --Asp (cRGD) peptide using the two different procedures. As proven from in vivo experiments in mice, the presence of nonconjugated surface moieties results in increased recognition by the immune system.

Mast cell tryptase was stained with the sensitive substrate Z--Pro--4-methoxy-2-naphthylamide, and chymase with Suc-Val-Pro-Phe-MNA and monoclonal B7 anti-chymase antibody. In addition, healthy-looking skin from 27 psoriatic patients was tape-stripped resulting in induction of the Köbner response in 9 patients. Sequential biopsies were taken before and after (7, 14 and 21 days) tape-stripping, and both tryptase and chymase were stained enzyme-histochemically. In non-lesional psoriatic skin, 70 +/- 24% (mean +/- SD) of the mast cells contained chymase enzyme activity, and 78 +/- 18% chymase immunoreactivity. About 10% of the chymase-immunoreactive cells lacked chymase activity. In lesional psoriatic skin, tryptase-positive cells were increased in number throughout the dermis but especially beneath the epidermis. Chymase immunoreactivity paralleled the tryptase activity, whereas chymase activity was strongly diminished both in terms of mast cell numbers and in staining intensity in the papillary dermis. The apparent inactivation of chymase may be due to the action of the chymase inhibitors, alpha 1-antitrypsin and alpha 1-antichymotrypsin, localized immunohistochemically in mast cells of lesional and non-lesional psoriatic skin.

Amino acid and glucose consumption, cell growth, metabolism, antibody titer, and N-glycosylation patterns are always the major concerns during upstream process optimization, especially media optimization. Gaining knowledge on their interrelations could provide insight for obtaining higher immunoglobulin G (IgG) titer and better controlling glycosylation-related product quality. In this work, different fed-batch processes with two chemically defined proprietary media and feeds were studied using two IgG-producing cell lines. Our results indicate that the balance of glucose and amino acid concentration in the culture is important for cell growth, IgG titer and N-glycosylation. Accordingly, the ideal fate of glucose and amino acids in the culture could be mainly towards  and recombinant product, respectively. Accumulation of by-products such as NH4(+) and lactate as a consequence of unbalanced nutrient supply to cell activities inhibits cell growth. The levels of Leu and  in the culture, which relate to cell growth and IgG productivity, need to be well controlled. Amino acids with the highest consumption rates correlate with the most abundant amino acids present in the produced IgG, and thus require sufficient availability during culture. Case-by-case analysis is necessary for understanding the effect of media and process optimization on glycosylation. We found that in certain cases the presence of Man5 glycan can be linked to limitation of UDP-GlcNAc biosynthesis as a result of insufficient extracellular . However, under different culture conditions, high Man5 levels can also result from low α-1,3-mannosyl-glycoprotein 2-β-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (GnTI) and UDP-GlcNAc transporter activities, which may be attributed to high level of NH4+ in the cell culture. Furthermore, galactosylation of the mAb Fc glycans was found to be limited by UDP-Gal biosynthesis, which was observed to be both cell line and cultivation condition-dependent. Extracellular glucose and glutamine concentrations and uptake rates were positively correlated with intracellular UDP-Gal availability. All these findings are important for optimization of fed-batch culture for improving IgG production and directing glycosylation quality.© 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25344233>Uptake of amino acids and their metabolic conversion into the compatible solute proline confers osmoprotection to Bacillus subtilis.</a></h2><p>The data presented here reveal a new facet of the physiological adjustment processes through which Bacillus subtilis can derive osmostress protection. We found that the import of proteogenic (Glu, , Asp, Asn, and ) and of nonproteogenic (Orn and Cit) amino acids and their metabolic conversion into proline enhances growth under otherwise osmotically unfavorable conditions. Osmoprotection by amino acids depends on the functioning of the ProJ-ProA-ProH enzymes, but different entry points into this biosynthetic route are used by different amino acids to finally yield the compatible solute proline. Glu, , Asp, and Asn are used to replenish the cellular pool of glutamate, the precursor for proline production, whereas , Orn, and Cit are converted into γ-glutamic semialdehyde/Δ(1)-pyrroline-5-carboxylate, an intermediate in proline biosynthesis. The import of Glu, , Asp, Asn, , Orn, and Cit did not lead to a further increase in the size of the proline pool that is already present in osmotically stressed cells. Hence, our data suggest that osmoprotection of B. subtilis by this group of amino acids rests on the savings in biosynthetic building blocks and  that would otherwise have to be devoted either to the synthesis of the proline precursor glutamate or of proline itself. Since glutamate is the direct biosynthetic precursor for proline, we studied its uptake and found that GltT, an Na(+)-coupled symporter, is the main uptake system for both glutamate and aspartate in B. subtilis. Collectively, our data show how effectively B. subtilis can exploit environmental resources to derive osmotic-stress protection through physiological means.Copyright © 2015, American Society for Microbiology.

Two experiments were conducted to evaluate the effects of supplemental glutamine (-/+, 0 and 1%) and arginine (-/+, 0 and 0.25%) in a 2 × 2 factorial arrangement. Experiment 1 consisted of 8 replicates using 32 pens and focused on live performance to 44 d of age, carcass yield, and meat quality evaluations at 45 d of age. Live performance parameters including feed intake, BW gain, mortality, and feed conversion were evaluated. Post-harvest carcass yield, breast muscle quality (including WB and WS), proximate analysis, and mineral analysis of breast muscle and tibia bone were also evaluated. Experiment 2 comprised 4 replicates using 8 pens with weekly measurements of blood physiology and muscle myopathy development from 21 to 45 d of age. Broilers fed supplemental  and  (+/+) produced broilers with greater BW and improved FCR. The WB and WS severity increased with + diets, while only WB increased using + diets. Weekly observations revealed the greatest increase in WB myopathies occurred between 28 to 35 d, while WS significantly increased one week later (35 to 42 d). When comparing broilers of similar BW at 45 d, + diets resulted in greater WS scores and percentage breast muscle fat. Further analysis of WB and WS scores (independent of treatment affect) revealed that increased myopathy scores were associated with increased blood CO2, H2CO3, and reduced O2 with increased meat pH, moisture content, and Ca concentration. These results indicated that increased muscle Ca is associated with increased WB, while increased dietary glutamine and lack of  may have resulted in a reverse flux of the citric acid cycle and reduced electron transport chain activity resulting in increased WS.© 2018 Poultry Science Association Inc.</p><p>Keyword:['oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29490339>Enteral - Dipeptide Administration Increases Retinal Docosahexaenoic Acid and Neuroprotectin D1 in a Murine Model of Retinopathy of Prematurity.</a></h2><p>Low levels of the long chain polyunsaturated fatty acid (LCPUFA) docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) have been implicated in retinopathy of prematurity (ROP).

The only one amino acid residue that is significantly overrepresented around ethanol molecules is Tyr. There are usually two or more Tyr residues in the same ethanol binding site, while residues of Thr, Asp and  are underrepresented around them. Residues of Ala and Pro are significantly underrepresented in ethanol binding surfaces. Several residues (Phe, Val, Pro, Ala, , His, Ser, Asp) bind ethanol significantly more frequent if they are not included in beta strands. Residues of Ala, Ile and  preferably bind ethanol when they are included in an alpha helix. Ethanol molecules often make hydrogen bonds with  and nitrogen atoms from the main chain of a protein. Because of this reason, the binding of ethanol may be associated with the decrease of the length of alpha helices and the disappearance of 3/10 helices.

Up to 15% ethanol can blend with diesel to make e-diesel that can be used in fuel compression ignition engine. Urea-modified amino acids can be used as a very good vitalizer for yeast (, Baker's yeast (ATCC 204508)) growth and thus promote ethanol production.

Our previous study on the structural features of Mtb-SigH, consisting of three alpha helices, and its interaction with core RNA polymerase has been extended herein to determine the little known DNA sequence recognition pattern involving its cognate promoters. Herein, high resolution X-ray crystallographic structures of the protein-DNA complexes were inspected to determine the tentative DNA-binding helix of the σ factor. The binding interface in the available crystal structures is found to be populated mainly with specific residues such as , Asn, Lys, , and Ser. We uncovered the helix 3 of Mtb-SigH containing most of these amino acids, which ranged from  64 to  75, forming the predicted active site. The complex of Mtb-SigH:DNA is modelled with 20 promoter sequences. The binding affinity is predicted by scoring these protein-DNA complexes through proximity and interaction parameters obtained by molecular dynamics simulations. The promoters are ranked considering hydrogen bonding,  of interaction, buried surface area, and distance between centers of masses in interaction with the protein. The ranking is validated through in vitro transcription assays. The trends of these selected promoter interactions have shown variations parallel to the experimental evaluation, emphasizing the success of the active site determination along with screening of the promoter strength.

This enzyme catalyzes the deamination of N-formimino-l-glutamate to N-formyl-l-glutamate and ammonia in the histidine degradation pathway. The crystal structure of Pa5106 was determined in the presence of the inhibitors N-formimino-l-aspartate and N-guanidino-l-glutaric acid at resolutions of 1.9 and 1.4 Å, respectively. The structure of an individual subunit is composed of two domains with the larger domain folding as a distorted (β/α)8-barrel. The (β/α)8-barrel domain is composed of eight β-strands flanked by 11 α-helices, whereas the smaller domain is made up of eight β-strands. The active site of Pa5106 contains a single zinc atom that is coordinated by His-56, His-58, His-232, and Asp-320. The nucleophilic solvent water molecule coordinates with the zinc atom at a distance of 2.0 Å and is hydrogen bonded to Asp-320 and His-269. The α-carboxylate groups of both inhibitors are hydrogen bonded to the imidazole moiety of His-206, the hydroxyl group of Tyr-121, and the side chain amide group of -61. The side chain carboxylate groups of the two inhibitors are ion-paired with the guanidino groups of -209 and -82.

Targeting of cytokine by tumor homing peptides (THPs) to the tumor cell surface molecule-like integrin shows to be beneficial in gene  approaches. In this study, the in silico targeting of RGD/NGR-modified IL-24 to tumor cells was conducted. In this regard, the sequences of six new synthetic IL-24s that have been modified by RGD (--Asp) or NGR (CRNGRGPDC) were aligned and their structures were modeled through homology modeling to evaluate their attachment potential to cognate receptor complexes such as IL-20R1/IL-20R2, IL-22R1/IL-20R2, or Sig1R. The results of homology modeling showed that modification of IL-24 with RGD motif in N-terminal and middle of this protein exhibited stronger interaction with cognate receptors. These results also demonstrated that modified IL-24 with RGD motif in the C-terminal has lost native activity. However, the interaction of THP-modified IL-24 with Sig1R would not be affected to that extent, interestingly. Conclusively, in silico analysis showed that modification of IL-24 with THPs needs a more detailed study as these modifications may disrupt native interaction with receptors and reduce apoptosis induction property.

(2) Cathepsin A and D and neutral proteinase activity first decreased (during the 5 days before birth) and then increased (primarily during the first 10 days after birth) in development. The total enzyme content per unit weight of brain did not change greatly after 10 days, although specific activity fell owing to an increase in protein in older animals. (3) The developmental pattern of activities or peptidases measured with Leu- and Leu-- and of arylamidases measured with - and -beta-naphthylamides was similar to that of proteinases. Total and specific activities increased rapidly after birth; then total activity did not change and specific activity decreased. (4) The proteinase content of tissue fractions (nuclear and lysosomal-mitochondrial) similarly reached a maximal peak in the rapid growth phase of the brain. (5) The decrease of hydrolytic activity after 10 days of age seems to parallel a decrease in the rates of protein breakdown in vivo, showing parallel behavior with decreasing protein turnover. In contrast, during the first 10 days of life protein turnover and calculated rate of protein breakdown in vivo decrease while the level of hydrolytic enzymes increases.</p><p>Keyword:['mitochondria']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25109467>Proteomic analysis of protein methylation in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.</a></h2><p>Protein methylation catalyzed by SAM-dependent methyltransferase represents a major PTM involved in many important biological processes. Because methylation can occur on nitrogen,  and sulfur centers and multiple methylation states exist on the nitrogen centers, methylproteome remains poorly documented. Here we present the methylation by isotope labeled SAM (MILS) strategy for a highly-confident analysis of the methylproteome of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae based on the online multidimensional μHPLC/MS/MS technology. We identified 43 methylated proteins, containing 68 methylation events associated with 64 methylation sites. More than 90% of these methylation events were previously unannotated in Uniprot database. Our results indicated, 1) over 2.6% of identified S. cerevisiae proteins are methylated, 2) the amino acid residue preference of protein methylation follows the order Lys≫>Asp>Asn≈≈His>Glu>Cys, and 3) the methylation state on nitrogen center is largely exclusive. As our dataset covers various types of methylation centers, it provides rich information about yeast methylproteome and should significantly contribute to the field of protein methylation.In this paper, we presented the methylation by isotope labeled SAM (MILS) strategy for a highly-confident analysis of the methylproteome of the yeast S. cerevisiae and collected a comprehensive list of proteins methylated on a set of distinct residues (K, R, N, E, D, Q, H, C).

The hypothesis for the study was that progressive basement membrane (BM) modification by advanced glycation end products (AGEs) contributes to impairment of EPC reparative function after diabetes-related endothelial injury.EPCs isolated from peripheral blood were characterized by immunocytochemistry and flow cytometry. EPC interactions on native or AGE-modified fibronectin (AGE-FN) were studied for attachment and spreading, whereas chemotaxis to SDF-1 was assessed with the Dunn chamber assay. In addition, photoreactive agent-treated monolayers of retinal microvascular endothelial cells (RMECs) produced circumscribed areas of apoptosis and the ability of EPCs to "endothelialize" these wounds was evaluated.EPC attachment and spreading on AGE-FN was reduced compared with control cells (P < 0.05-0.01) but was significantly restored by pretreatment with --Asp (RGD). Chemotaxis of EPCs was abolished on AGE-FN but was reversed by treatment with exogenous RGD. On wounded RMEC monolayers, EPCs showed clustering at the wound site, compared with untreated regions (P < 0.001); AGE-FN significantly reduced this targeting response (P < 0.05). RGD supplementation enhanced EPC incorporation in the monolayer, as determined by EPC participation in   formation and restoration of transendothelial electric resistance (TEER).AGE-modification of vascular substrates impairs EPC adhesion, spreading, and migration; and alteration of the RGD integrin recognition motif plays a key role in these responses.

The structure of PCNA from Leishmania donovani (LdPCNA) has been determined at 2.73Å resolution. Structure consists of six crystallographically independent molecules which form two trimeric rings. The pore diameter of the individual trimeric ring is of the order of 37Å. The two rings are stacked through their front to front faces. In order to gain a stable packing, the rings are rotated by 42° about the pore axis and shifted by 7Å and tilted by 16° along the perpendicular direction to pore axis. This form of stacking reduced the effective diameter of the pore to 32Å. The sequence of LdPCNA consists of a long segment of 41 amino acid residues (186--Val-Ser-Asp--Ser-Thr-Lys-Ser-Glu-Val-Lys-Ala-Glu-Val-Lys-Ala-Glu-Ala--Asp-Asp-Asp-Glu-Glu-Pro-Leu-Ser--Lys-Tyr--Lys-Ala-Asp-Ser-Ser-Ala-Asn-Ala-Ile-226) whereas the corresponding segments in other PCNAs contain only eight residues corresponding to 186--Val-Ser-Asp-------224-Asn-Ala-Ile-226.

The report that several high-resolution X-ray crystal structures of orotidine 5'-monophosphate decarboxylase (OMPDC) failed to provide a consensus mechanism for enzyme-catalyzed decarboxylation of OMP to form uridine 5'-monophosphate, therefore, provoked a flurry of controversy. This controversy was fueled by the enormous 10-fold rate acceleration for this enzyme, which had " jolted many biochemists' assumptions about the catalytic potential of enzymes." Our studies on the mechanism of action of OMPDC provide strong evidence that catalysis by this enzyme is not fundamentally different from less proficient catalysts, while highlighting important architectural elements that enable a peak level of performance. Many enzymes undergo substrate-induced protein conformational changes that trap their substrates in solvent occluded protein cages, but the conformational change induced by ligand binding to OMPDC is incredibly complex, as required to enable the development of 22 kcal/mol of stabilizing binding interactions with the phosphodianion and ribosyl substrate fragments of OMP. The binding  from these fragments is utilized to activate OMPDC for catalysis of decarboxylation at the orotate fragment of OMP, through the creation of a tight, catalytically active, protein cage from the floppy, open, unliganded form of OMPDC. Such utilization of binding  for ligand-driven conformational changes provides a general mechanism to obtain specificity in transition state binding. The rate enhancement that results from the binding of carbon acid substrates to enzymes is partly due to a reduction in the carbon acid p K that is associated with ligand binding. The binding of UMP to OMPDC results in an unusually large >12 unit decrease in the p K = 29 for abstraction of the C-6 substrate hydrogen, due to stabilization of an enzyme-bound vinyl carbanion, which is also an intermediate of OMPDC-catalyzed decarboxylation. The protein-ligand interactions operate to stabilize the vinyl carbanion at the enzyme active site compared to aqueous solution, rather than to stabilize the transition state for the concerted electrophilic displacement of CO by H that avoids formation of this reaction intermediate. There is evidence that OMPDC induces strain into the bound substrate. The interaction between the amide side chain of -215 from the phosphodianion gripper loop and the hydroxymethylene side chain of Ser-154 from the pyrimidine umbrella of ScOMPDC position the amide side chain to interact with the phosphodianion of OMP. There are no direct stabilizing interactions between dianion gripper protein side chains -215, Tyr-217, and -235 and the pyrimidine ring at the decarboxylation transition state. Rather these side chains function solely to hold OMPDC in the catalytically active closed conformation. The hydrophobic side chains that line the active site of OMPDC in the region of the departing CO product may function to stabilize the decarboxylation transition state by providing hydrophobic solvation of this product.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27108103>Dynamics simulation of soybean agglutinin (SBA) dimer reveals the impact of glycosylation on its enhanced structural stability.</a></h2><p>The legume lectins are widely used as a model system for studying protein-carbohydrate and protein-protein interactions. They exhibit a fascinating quaternary structure variation. Recently, it has become clear that lectins exist as oligomers. Soybean agglutinin is a tetrameric legume lectin, each of whose subunits are glycosylated. In the present study we explore the main origin for the stability of soybean agglutinin dimer. In order to understand the role of glycosylation on the dimeric interface, we have carried out normal (298K), high temperatures (380K, 500K) long explicit solvent molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and compared the structural and conformational changes between the glycosylated and non-glycosylated dimers. The study reveals that the high degree of stability at normal temperature is mostly contributed by interfacial ionic interactions (~200 kcal/mol) between polar residues like Lys, , Asp, Thr, Ser, Asn and  (62%). It maintains its overall folded conformation due to high subunit interactions at the non-canonical interface. Mainly five important hydrogen bonds between CO of one β sheet of one subunit with the N-H of other β strand of the other subunit help to maintain the structural integrity. Ten inter subunit salt-bridge interactions between  185-Asṕ192, Lys 163-Asṕ169, Asp 169-Lyś 163 and Asp 192-Arǵ 185 at non-canonical interface appear to be important to maintain the three dimensional structure of SBA dimer.

Anti-PD1 antibody (aPD1)  is the most significant and impactful therapy for melanoma by immune checkpoint inhibition and T cell stimulation to mediate tumor killing. But the clinical remission rate of aPD1  is limited in melanoma. Here we show a potent combination of aPD1 and photothermal therapy (PTT) by effective delivery of a multifunctional phase-transformation nanocarrier to melanoma tumor. We successfully synthesized multifunctional nanoparticles (NPs) encapsulated with aPD1, iron oxide and perfluoropentane (PFP) in lactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) shell modified with poly ethylene glycol (PEG) and ---Asp-Ser (GRGDS) peptides (GOP@aPD1). In vitro, GOP@aPD1 NPs were characterized for particle size and drug-loading efficiency. The NPs were also tested for photothermal property, optical droplet vaporization (ODV) capacity and the ability of aPD1 release profile. In vivo, GOP@aPD1 NPs were systemically administered to melanoma-bearing mice demonstrated no toxicity and accumulation at tumor site. When mediated with PTT, this synergistic treatment achieved enhanced antitumor efficacy, due to combination of the effective aPD1 release and increased CD8+ T cell infiltration in tumor site. In conclusion, GOP@aPD1 NPs combined with PTT could potentiate the efficacy of aPD1 not only by tumor-targeted delivery of aPD1 but also by activating the immune system in the tumor microenvironment, which is a highly effective approach to treat melanoma.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Nanostructured surfaces represent a novel T-cell stimulation technique that enables us to fine-tune the density and orientation of activating molecules presented to the cells. In this work, we studied the influence of integrin-mediated cell-adhesion on T-cell activation, proliferation, and differentiation using nanostructured surfaces, which provide a well-defined system at the nanoscale compared with standard cultures. Specifically, we synthesized a polymeric polyethylene glycol (PEG) hydrogel cross-linked with two fibronectin-derived peptides, cyclic --Asp (cRGD) and cyclic Leu-Asp-Val (cLDV), that are known to activate different integrins. Moreover, the hydrogels were decorated with a quasi-hexagonal array of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) functionalized with the activating antibody CD3 to initiate T-cell activation.

Oxidative stress (OS) has been implicated to play a role in its cause; therefore, antioxidants and repair systems may help in restoring oxidant-antioxidant balance. Since polymorphisms in DNA repair genes can result in reduced DNA repair capacity, it is important to investigate its association with OS products to demonstrate the impact of individual susceptibility. Our aim is to examine whether a defect in one of the detoxifying and DNA repair enzyme systems could explain the association between MS and exposure to OS products.We investigated the association of polymorphisms in the metabolizing and DNA repair genes with serum Reactive  Species (ROS) levels. Gene polymorphisms were analyzed by simultaneous multiplex and Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism Polymerase Chain Reaction and serum ROS levels were detected.OGG1 Ser/Cys and Ser/Cys+Cys/Cys genotypes had higher MS risk. XRCC1 /+/ genotype increased the risk of MS.Our data suggested that OGG1 Ser326Cys gene polymorphism is a major genetic factor involved in the development of MS. Smoking is also a pivotal confounding factor for subjects with mutant genotypes of XRCC1 Arg399Gln. Further studies are needed to reaffirm our results.Copyright © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Egg white ovotransferrin-derived tripeptides, IRW (Ile--Trp), IQW (Ile--Trp), or LKP (Leu-Lys-Pro) are previously identified as the inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), a key enzyme in the RAS. This study aims at determining whether these peptides are effective in improving insulin resistance, and their mechanisms of action, in a rat derived skeletal muscle cell line (L6 cells).Insulin resistance is induced by treating L6 cells with 1 μm angiotensin II (Ang II) for 24 h. Effects of peptides on glucose uptake are determined using glucose uptake assay, glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) translocation by immunofluorescence, reactive  species (ROS) by dihydroethidium (DHE) staining, while insulin signaling pathway, Ang II receptor (AT1R or AT2R) levels, and NADPH oxidase activation are measured using Western Blot. Only IRW treatment significantly improves insulin resistance in L6 cells via stimulation of insulin signaling. IRW decreases Ang II-stimulated AT1R expression, ROS formation, and NADPH oxidase activation.Of three ACE inhibitory peptides studied, only IRW improves insulin resistance in L6 cells, at least partially via reduced AT1R expression and its anti-oxidative activity.© 2017 The Authors.

All LOX belong to the same gene family, and they are widely distributed. LOX of animals, plants, and prokaryotes contain iron as the catalytic metal, whereas fungi express LOX with iron or with manganese. Little is known about metal selection by LOX and the adjustment of the redox potentials of their protein-bound catalytic metals. Thirteen three-dimensional structures of animal, plant, and prokaryotic FeLOX are available, but none of MnLOX. The MnLOX of the most important plant pathogen, the rice blast fungusMagnaporthe oryzae(Mo), was expressed inPichia pastoris.Mo-MnLOX was deglycosylated, purified to homogeneity, and subjected to crystal screening and x-ray diffraction. The structure was solved by sulfur and manganese single wavelength anomalous dispersion to a resolution of 2.0 Å. The manganese coordinating sphere is similar to iron ligands of coral 8R-LOX and soybean LOX-1 but is not overlapping. The Asn-473 is positioned on a short loop (Asn--Gly-Glu-Pro) instead of an α-helix and forms hydrogen bonds with -281. Comparison with FeLOX suggests that Phe-332 and Phe-525 might contribute to the unique suprafacial hydrogen abstraction and oxygenation mechanism of Mo-MnLOX by controlling  access to the pentadiene radical. Modeling suggests that -525 is positioned close to -182 of 8R-LOX, and both residues likely tether the carboxylate group of the substrate. An  channel could not be identified. We conclude that Mo-MnLOX illustrates a partly unique variation of the structural theme of FeLOX.© 2016 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><p>Keyword:['oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31076642>Complement C3 activation regulates the production of tRNA-derived fragments -tRFs and promotes alcohol-induced  injury and steatosis.</a></h2><p>Complement is known to play a role in alcoholic   disease (AFLD), but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood, thereby constraining the development of a rational approach for therapeutic intervention in the complement system. C3 deficiency has been shown to impart protective effects against ethanol-induced hepatic steatosis and inflammation. Here we demonstrate a protection effect in wild-type mice by treatment with CR2-Crry, a specific inhibitor of C3 activation. The expression of glycine transfer (t) RNA-derived fragments (-tRFs) is upregulated in ethanol-fed mice and inhibition of -tRFs in vivo decreases chronic ethanol feeding-induced hepatosteatosis without affecting inflammation. The expression of -tRF was downregulated in C3-deficient or CR2-Crry-treated mice, but not in C5-deficient mice; -tRF expression was restored by the C3 activation products C3a or Asp (C3a-des-) via the regulation of CYP2E1. Transcriptome profiling of hepatic tissues showed that -tRF inhibitors upregulate the expression of sirtuin1 (Sirt1) and subsequently affect downstream lipogenesis and β-oxidation pathways. Mechanistically, -tRF interacts with AGO3 to downregulate Sirt1 expression via sequence complementarity in the 3' UTR. Notably, the expression levels of C3d, CYP2E1 and -tRF are upregulated, whereas Sirt1 is decreased in AFLD patients compared to healthy controls. Collectively, our findings suggest that C3 activation products contribute to hepatosteatosis by regulating the expression of -tRF. Complement inhibition at the C3 activation step and treatment with -tRF inhibitors may be potential and precise therapeutic approaches for AFLD.</p><p>Keyword:['fatty liver']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27301873>TAT Peptide-Conjugated Magnetic PLA-PEG Nanocapsules for the Targeted Delivery of Paclitaxel: In Vitro and Cell Studies.</a></h2><p>Paclitaxel (PTX) and organophilic iron oxide nanocrystals of 7 nm average size were co-encapsulated in the oily core of poly(lactide)-poly(ethyleneglycol) (PLA-PEG) nanocapsules in order to develop magnetically responsive nanocarriers of PTX.

In the present study, we sought, in a model of Western diet-induced NAFLD, to determine whether citrulline (Cit), an amino acid that regulates protein and  metabolism, could decrease Western diet-induced liver injuries, as well as the mechanisms involved. Sprague-Dawley rats were fed a high-fat diet (45 %) and fructose (30 %) in drinking water or a control diet associated with water (group C) for 8 weeks. The high-fat, high-fructose diet (Western diet) was fed either alone (group WD) or with Cit (1 g/kg per d) (group WDC) or an isonitrogenous amount of non-essential amino acids (group WDA). We evaluated nutritional and metabolic status, liver function, intestinal barrier function, gut microbiota and splanchnic inflammatory status. Cit led to a lower level of hepatic TAG restricted to microvesicular lipid droplets and to a lower mRNA expression of CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein homologous protein, a marker of endoplasmic reticulum stress, of pro-inflammatory cytokines Il6 (P<0·05) and Tnfα, and of toll-like receptor 4 (Tlr4) (P<0·05). Cit also improved plasma TAG and insulin levels. In the colon, it decreased inflammation (Tnfα and Tlr4 expressions) and increased claudin-1 protein expression. This was associated with higher levels of Bacteroides/Prevotella compared with rats fed the Western diet alone. Cit improves Western diet-induced liver injuries via decreased lipid deposition, increased insulin sensitivity, lower inflammatory process and preserved antioxidant status. This may be related in part to its protective effects at the gut level.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28153100>Systemic Delivery of Tumor-Targeted Bax-Derived Membrane-Active Peptides for the Treatment of Melanoma Tumors in a Humanized SCID Mouse Model.</a></h2><p>Melanoma is a highly metastatic and deadly form of cancer. Invasive melanoma cells overexpress integrin αβ, which is a well-known target for --Asp-based (RGD) peptides. We developed a sophisticated method to synthetize milligram amounts of a targeted vector that allows the RGD-mediated targeting, internalization, and release of a mitochondria-disruptive peptide derived from the pro-apoptotic Bax protein. We found that 2.5 μM Bax[109-127] was sufficient to destabilize the mitochondria in ten different tumor cell lines, even in the presence of the anti-apoptotic Bcl2 protein, which is often involved in tumor resistance. This pore-forming peptide displayed antitumor activity when it was covalently linked by a disulfide bridge to the tetrameric RAFT-c[RGD]-platform and after intravenous injection in a human melanoma tumor model established in humanized immuno-competent mice. In addition to its direct toxic effect, treatment with this combination induced the release of the immuno-stimulating factor monocyte chimoattractant protein 1 (MCP1) in the blood and a decrease in the level of the pro-angiogenic factor FGF2.

Protective effects of glutamine on intestinal barrier function have been previously shown but the effects of other amino acids remained poorly documented. Thus, we aimed to evaluate the effects of nine amino acids on intestinal permeability during methotrexate (MTX) treatment in Caco-2 cells.Caco-2 cells were incubated in culture medium supplemented with glutamine, arginine, glutamate, leucine, taurine, citrulline, glycine, histidine or cysteine during 24 h and then treated with MTX (100 ng/ml). The dose of each amino acid was 16.6 fold the physiological plasma concentrations. Barrier function was assessed by transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER), FITC-dextran paracellular flux, occludin and ZO-1 expression and localization. Signaling pathways were also studied.Only glutamine, glutamate, arginine and leucine reversed the decrease of TEER observed after MTX treatment (P < 0.05). Interestingly, the addition of 6-diazo-5-oxo-1-norleucine, an inhibitor of glutaminase, blunted the effect of glutamine on MTX-treated cells (P < 0.05). Glutamine and arginine combination restored TEER and FITC-dextran flux to a similar extent than glutamine alone. In addition, pretreatment of Caco-2 cells with glutamine and arginine, alone or combined, differently limited the decrease of ZO-1 and occludin expression (P < 0.05) and the alteration of their cellular distribution, through c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), Extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) pathways.Glutamine prevented MTX-induced barrier disruption in Caco-2 cells.

In this meta-analysis, we summarized the association of the II/I polymorphism in leptin gene and Gln223Arg polymorphism in LEPR gene with hypertension and circulating leptin.PubMed and Embase were systematically searched. Data extraction and study quality were assessed in duplicate. Statistical analyses were carried out with the STATA software (v. 11.2).A total of 11 articles written in English were eligible. Overall analysis identified a significant association between II/I polymorphism I allele and increased risk of hypertension under allelic (odds ratio; 95% confidence interval; P: 1.48; 1.06-2.08; 0.022) and homozygous genotypic (2.27; 1.20-4.29; 0.012) models. The magnitude of the association for II/I polymorphism I allele with hypertension was substantiated in Asians and for essential hypertension under both genetic models.

Four of the peptides have been identified in bag cell releasates and are known to act as nonsynaptic neurotransmitters in the abdominal ganglion. The isolation, primary structure, and proposed biological activity of a fifth peptide product (delta-bag cell peptide (delta-BCP)) from the ELH precursor are described. delta-BCP was established to be a 39-residue peptide: NH2-Asp-Gln-Asp-Glu--Asn-Phe--Phe-Pro-Thr-Asn-Ala-Val-Ser-Met- Ser-Ala-Asp- Glu-Asn-Ser-Pro-Phe-Asp-Leu-Ser-Asn-Glu-Asp--Ala-Val-Tyr-Gln-- Asp-Leu-COOH. This sequence corresponds to residues 81-119 of the ELH prohormone and shares sequence identity with atrial gland peptides A and B.

In the cellulase and xylanase families, the conserved amino acids in the active site architecture were mostly found at the -2 to +1 subsites, while in β-glucosidase they were mainly concentrated at the -1 subsite. Families with more conserved binding amino acid residues displayed strong selectivity for their ligands, while those with fewer conserved binding amino acid residues often exhibited promiscuity when recognizing ligands. Enzymes with different activities also tended to bind different hydroxyl  atoms on the ligand.

Insulin resistance (IR), a central component of this disease, occurs in 30%-40% of women with PCOS. To date, the molecular mechanism underlying PCOS-IR remains largely unknown. Most recently, increasing evidence has shown that mitochondrial dysfunction caused by mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations plays important roles in the pathogenesis of PCOS-IR. To identify the contribution of mitochondrial tRNA (mt-tRNA) mutations in this disease, we screened 80 women with PCOS-IR and 50 healthy control participants for mt-tRNA mutations. After genetic amplification and direct sequencing, we identified nine mt-tRNA mutations that were potentially associated with PCOS-IR: mt-tRNA A3302G and C3275A mutations, mt-tRNA T4363C and T4395C mutations, mt-tRNA C7492T mutation, mt-tRNA A7543G mutation, mt-tRNA A8343G mutation, mt-tRNA T10454C mutation and mt-tRNA A14693G mutation. These mutations were localized at evolutionarily conserved nucleotides and altered the secondary structure of mt-tRNAs, thus resulting in failure of mt-tRNA metabolism. Moreover, molecular and biochemical analysis revealed that levels of 8-OHdG, malondialdehyde and reactive  species were increased in patients with PCOS-IR carrying these mt-tRNA mutations compared with in healthy control participants, whereas superoxide dismutase levels, mitochondrial copy number, membrane potential and ATP levels were significantly reduced. Taken together, our data indicate that mt-tRNAs are key locations for pathogenic mutations associated with PCOS-IR. Mitochondrial dysfunction caused by mt-tRNA mutations may be involved in the pathogenesis of PCOS-IR.

We first obtained the X-ray structure of cyclolavandulyl diphosphate synthase containing two molecules of the substrate analog dimethylallyl ()-thiolodiphosphate (DMASPP). The two molecules have similar diphosphate group orientations to those seen in other ζ-fold (- head-to-tail and head-to-middle) prenyltransferases with one diphosphate moiety forming a bidentate chelate with Mg in the so-called S1 site (which is typically the allylic binding site in ζ-fold proteins) while the second diphosphate binds to Mg in the so-called S2 site (which is typically the homoallylic binding site in ζ-fold proteins)  a single P1O1 . The latter interaction can facilitate direct phosphate-mediated proton abstraction  P1O2, or more likely by an indirect mechanism in which P1O2 stabilizes a basic asparagine species that removes H, which is then eliminated  an Asn-Ser shuttle. The universal occurrence of Asn-Ser pairs in ζ-fold proteins leads to the idea that the highly conserved amide (Asn, ) and OH-containing (Tyr) residues seen in many "head-to-head" prenyltransferases such as squalene and dehydrosqualene synthase might play similar roles, in H elimination.

The separation of beneficial T cells from potentially harmful T cells can be achieved by using the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) I-Streptamer isolation technology, which has proven its feasibility for the fast and pure isolation of T-cell populations with a single specificity. We have analyzed the feasibility of the simultaneous isolation of multiple antigen-specific T-cell populations in one procedure by combining different MHC I-Streptamers.First, the effect of combining different amounts of MHC I-Streptamers used in the isolation procedure on the isolation efficacy of target antigen-specific T cells and on the number of off-target co-isolated contaminating cells was assessed. The feasibility of this approach was demonstrated in large-scale validation procedures targeting both high and low frequent T-cell populations using the Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP)-compliant CliniMACS Plus device.T-cell products targeting up to 24 different T-cell populations could be isolated in one, simultaneous MHC I-Streptamer procedure, by adjusting the amount of MHC I- Streptamers per target antigen-specific T-cell population.

The resulting GlcN-amino acid caramels were analysed for α-dicarbonyl compounds, polyhydroxyalkyl pyrazines, heterocyclic compound and alkylimidazoles. All the analyses were performed by using HPLC-MS/MS followed by pooling the variables with principal component analysis (PCA). GlcN- caramels generated the greatest amount of butterscotch aromatic compound diacetyl and polyhydroxyalkyl pyrazines (fructosazine and deoxyfructosazine). The potentially toxic heterocyclic compound, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) was generated in greater amounts with the GlcN- caramels. However, the toxic alkylimidazoles (4-MEI and THI) were not present in any of the GlcN-amino acid caramels. The results suggest that caramel with butterscotch aroma and bioactivity can be produced with GlcN-amino acid at 70 °C. The PCA performed discriminated the majority of the GlcN-amino acid combinations; GlcN- and GlcN-Ser were best discriminated.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The mfbA transcript was abundant in mature fruiting bodies, detectable in immature fruiting bodies but absent in earlier developmental stages and in the vegetative mycelium.

A 425-aa MFBA peptide containing the RGD motif (named MFBA(582-1006) peptide) was successfully produced using the phage T7 expression system. This MFBA(582-1006) peptide exhibited a cell adhesion and spreading activity toward mammalian cells.

Numerous studies have been reported aiming at the fractionation and characterization of the many molecular species present in the extract, but more efforts are still required to obtain sufficient quantities of the various purified protease forms for detailed physicochemical, enzymatic and structural characterization. In this work, we describe an efficient strategy towards the purification of at least eight enzymatic forms. Thus, following rapid fractionation on a SP-Sepharose FF column, two sub-populations with proteolytic activity were obtained: the unbound (termed acidic) and bound (termed basic) bromelain fractions. Following reversible modification with monomethoxypolyethylene glycol (mPEG), both fractions were further separated on Q-Sepharose FF and SP-Sepharose FF, respectively. This procedure yielded highly purified molecular species, all titrating ca. 1 mol of thiol group per mole of enzyme, with distinct biochemical properties. N-terminal sequencing allowed identifying at least eight forms with proteolytic activity. The basic fraction contained previously identified species, i.e. basic bromelain forms 1 and 2, ananain forms 1 and 2, and comosain (MEROPS identifier: C01.027). Furthermore, a new proteolytic species, showing similarities with basic bomelain forms 1 and 2, was discovered and termed bromelain form 3. The two remaining species were found in the acidic bromelain fraction and were arbitrarily named acidic bromelain forms 1 and 2. Both, acidic bromelain forms 1, 2 and basic bromelain forms 1, 2 and 3 are glycosylated, while ananain forms 1 and 2, and comosain are not. The eight protease forms display different amidase activities against the various substrates tested, namely small synthetic chromogenic compounds (DL-BAPNA and Boc-Ala-Ala--pNA), fluorogenic compounds (like Boc-Gln-Ala--AMC, Z--AMC and Z-Phe--AMC), and proteins (azocasein and azoalbumin), suggesting a specific organization of their catalytic residues. All forms are completely inhibited by specific cysteine and cysteine/serine protease inhibitors, but not by specific serine and aspartic protease inhibitors, with the sole exception of pepstatin A that significantly affects acidic bromelain forms 1 and 2. For all eight protease forms, inhibition is also observed with 1,10-phenanthrolin, a metalloprotease inhibitor. Metal ions (i.e. Mn, Mg and Ca) showed various effects depending on the protease under consideration, but all of them are totally inhibited in the presence of Zn. Mass spectrometry analyses revealed that all forms have a molecular mass of ca. 24 kDa, which is characteristic of enzymes belonging to the papain-like proteases family. Far-UV CD spectra analysis further supported this analysis. Interestingly, secondary structure calculation proves to be highly reproducible for all cysteine proteases of the papain family tested so far (this work; see also Azarkan et al., 2011; Baeyens-Volant et al., 2015) and thus can be used as a test for rapid identification of the classical papain fold.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

In the present study, the distribution of chymase- and tryptase-containing mast cells was morphometrically analysed at different dermal levels of lesional and non-lesional psoriatic skin (12 patients) as well as normal human skin. Mast cell tryptase was identified enzyme-histochemically, using Z--Pro--MNA as the substrate. For demonstrating mast cell chymase, a simple and specific enzyme-histochemical staining method was developed, using Suc-Val-Pro-Phe-MNA as the substrate. All mast cells positive for chymase were also positive for tryptase and Giemsa stain. Although the number of tryptase-positive mast cells was slightly increased throughout the dermis of lesional psoriatic skin, this increase was most pronounced in the upper dermis immediately beneath, and in close contact with, the epidermis. In contrast, the number of chymase-positive mast cells was clearly decreased in the upper dermis of psoriatic lesions, but not in the deeper dermis, as compared with non-lesional psoriatic skin. In addition, all chymase-positive mast cells observed in the upper dermis were very weakly stained when compared with those in the deeper dermis. No differences were found between non-lesional psoriatic skin and normal skin in which the number of mast cells containing chymase was 72-73% of the number containing tryptase. The present results suggest that T mast cells particularly, containing tryptase but no chymase, proliferate in psoriatic lesions, and that the increase in tryptase activity and the decrease in chymase activity in the upper dermis may lead to an imbalance in the biochemical regulatory systems.</p><p>Keyword:['psoriasis']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27637923>Fluorescent substrates for ADAM15 useful for assaying and high throughput screening.</a></h2><p>A disintegrin and metalloproteinase 15 (ADAM15), also known as metargidin, plays important roles in regulating inflammation, wound healing, neovascularization, and is an attractive drug target. Fluorescence resonance  transfer (FRET)-based peptide substrates were tested to identify candidate reagents for high throughput screening and detection of ADAM15 in biological samples. ADAM15 exhibits a unique and diverse activity profile compared to other metalloproteinases. Two FRET substrates, Dabcyl-Gly-Pro-Leu-Gly-Met--Gly-Lys(FAM)-NH2 (PEPDAB011) and Dabcyl-Ala-Pro--Trp-Ile--Asp-Lys(FAM)-NH2 (PEPDAB017), which also detect activities of several matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs -2, -9, and -13), were efficiently cleaved by ADAM15 with specificity constants of 5800 M s and 4300 M s, respectively. Additionally, ADAM15 efficiently processed Dabcyl-Leu--Glu----Leu-Lys-Ser-Lys(FAM)-NH2 (PEPDAB022), which is based on a physiological CD23 cleavage site, with a specificity constant (k/K) of 5200 M s. PEPDAB022 was used to screen the ability of known metalloproteinase inhibitors including TAPI-2, marimastat, GI-254023, and the Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinases(TIMPs) 1 and 3 to block ADAM15 activity. Even though ADAM15 exhibits similar substrate preferences to other metalloproteinases, many broad spectrum inhibitors failed to block ADAM15 activity at concentrations as high as 50 μM. Thus, a clear need exists to develop potent and selective ADAM15 inhibitors, and the FRET substrates described herein should aid future research efforts towards this aim.Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

In mammalian mitochondria, the initial step of the Fe-S cluster assembly process is assisted by the NFS1-ISD11 complex, which delivers sulfur to scaffold protein ISCU during Fe-S cluster synthesis. Although ISD11 is an essential protein, its cellular role in Fe-S cluster biogenesis is still not defined. Our study maps the important ISD11 amino acid residues belonging to putative helix 1 (Phe-40), helix 3 (Leu-63, -68, -69, Ile-72, Tyr-76), and C-terminal segment (Leu-81, Glu-84) are critical for in vivo Fe-S cluster biogenesis. Importantly, mutation of these conserved ISD11 residues into alanine leads to its compromised interaction with NFS1, resulting in reduced stability and enhanced aggregation of NFS1 in the mitochondria. Due to altered interaction with ISD11 mutants, the levels of NFS1 and Isu1 were significantly depleted, which affects Fe-S cluster biosynthesis, leading to reduced electron transport chain complex (ETC) activity and mitochondrial respiration. In humans, a clinically relevant ISD11 mutation (R68L) has been associated in the development of a mitochondrial genetic disorder, COXPD19. Our findings highlight that the ISD11 R68A/R68L mutation display reduced affinity to form a stable subcomplex with NFS1, and thereby fails to prevent NFS1 aggregation resulting in impairment of the Fe-S cluster biogenesis. The prime affected machinery is the ETC complex, which showed compromised redox properties, causing diminished mitochondrial respiration. Furthermore, the R68L ISD11 mutant displayed accumulation of mitochondrial iron and reactive  species, leading to mitochondrial dysfunction, which correlates with the phenotype observed in COXPD19 patients.© 2015 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><p>Keyword:['oxygen']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25996182>Oncolytic viruses: From bench to bedside with a focus on safety.</a></h2><p>Oncolytic viruses are a relatively new class of anti-cancer  agents.

However, excessive activity and poor control over such engineered T cells cause significant safety challenges, such as cytokine release syndrome and organ toxicities. To enhance the specificity and controllable activity of CAR-T cells, we report a novel switchable dual-receptor CAR-engineered T (sdCAR-T) cell and a new switch molecule of FITC-HM-3 bifunctional molecule (FHBM) in this study.We designed a fusion molecule comprising FITC and HM-3. HM-3, an antitumor peptide including an --Asp sequence, can specifically target integrin αvβ3 that is presented on some tumor cells. Moreover, to improve the specificity of CAR-T cells, we also generated the sdCAR-T cell line against cognate tumor cells expressing human mesothelin (MSLN) and integrin αvβ3. Finally, the activity of sdCAR-T cell and FHBM is verified via in vitro and in vivo experiments.In the presence of FHBM, the designed sdCAR-T cells exerted high activity including activation and proliferation and had specific cytotoxicity in a time- and dose-dependent manner in vitro. Furthermore, using a combination of FHBM in nude mice, sdCAR-T cells significantly inhibited the growth of MSLN K562 cells and released lower levels of the cytokines (e.g., interleukin-2, interferon γ, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor α) relative to conventional CAR-T cells, obtaining specific, controllable, and enhanced cytotoxicity.Our data indicate that FHBM can accurately control timing and dose of injected CAR-T cells, and sdCAR-T cells exert significant antitumor activity while releasing lower levels of cytokines for the cognate tumor cells expressing both MSLN and integrin αvβ3. Therefore, combination therapies using sdCAR-T cells and the switch molecule FHBM have significant potential to treat malignancies.</p><p>Keyword:['immunotherapy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31250878>Postprandial insulin and nutrient concentrations in lipopolysaccharide-challenged growing pigs reared in thermoneutral and high ambient temperatures1.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to evaluate the associated effects of ambient temperature and inflammation caused by repeated administration of Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on insulin, , and AA metabolism. Twenty-eight pigs were assigned to one of the two thermal conditions: thermoneutral (24 °C) or high ambient temperature (30 °C). The experimental period lasted 17 d, which was divided into a 7-d period without LPS (days -7 to -1), and a subsequent 10-d LPS period (days 1 to 10) in which pigs were administered 5 repeated injections of LPS at 2-d intervals. Postprandial profiles of plasma insulin and nutrients were evaluated through serial blood samples taken on days -4 (P0), 4 (P1), and 8 (P2). Before the LPS-challenge (P0), postprandial concentrations of glucose, lactate, , Ile, Leu, Phe, Tyr, and Val were greater in pigs kept at 24 °C than at 30 °C (P < 0.05). In contrast, , Asp, Gly, His, and Met postprandial concentrations at P0 were lower at 24 °C than at 30 °C (P < 0.05). At both 24 and 30 °C conditions, pigs had greater postprandial concentrations of insulin (P < 0.01) and lower concentrations of NEFA (P < 0.01) and α-amino nitrogen (P < 0.05) at P1 and P2 than at P0. Compared with P0, postprandial concentrations of glucose were greater (P < 0.05) at P1 in pigs kept at 24 °C, and at P1 and P2 in pigs kept at 30 °C. At both ambient temperatures, pigs had lower (P < 0.05) postprandial concentrations of Ala, Gly, His, Ile, Leu, Pro, Ser, Thr, Trp, and Val at P1 and P2 than at P0. Arginine postprandial concentration at P1 was lower than at P0 in pigs kept at 24 °C (P < 0.05), whereas no difference was observed in pigs at 30 °C. Relative to P0,  and Tyr concentrations were lower at P1 and P2 in pigs kept at 24 °C (P < 0.01), whereas lower  concentration was observed only at P2 (P < 0.01) and lower Tyr only at P1 (P < 0.01) in pigs kept at 30 °C. Our study shows a hyperglycemic and hyperinsulinemic state in LPS-challenged pigs and a greater magnitude of this response in pigs kept at 30 °C. Furthermore, LPS caused important changes in BCAA, His, Thr, and Trp profiles, suggesting the role these AA in supporting the inflammatory response. Finally, our results suggest that LPS-induced effects on postprandial profiles of specific AA (, , Phe, and Tyr) may be modulated by ambient temperature.© The Author(s) 2019.

The answer given by bioinformatics relies on the frequency of change of each amino acid by another one and the propensity of each to remain unchanged. We propose that these replacement rules are recoverable from the secondary structural trends of amino acids. A distance measure between high-resolution Ramachandran distributions reveals that structurally similar residues coincide with those found in substitution matrices such as BLOSUM: Asn ↔ Asp, P™he ↔ Tyr, Lys ↔ ,  ↔ Glu, Ile ↔ Val, Met → Leu; with Ala, Cys, His, Gly, Ser, Pro, and Thr, as structurally idiosyncratic residues. We also found a high average correlation ([Formula: see text] = 0.85) between thirty amino acid mutability scales and the mutational inertia (I  ), which measures the energetic cost weighted by the number of observations at the most probable amino acid conformation. These results indicate that amino acid substitutions follow two optimally-efficient principles: (a) amino acids interchangeability privileges their secondary structural similarity, and (b) the amino acid mutability depends directly on its biosynthetic  cost, and inversely with its frequency. These two principles are the underlying rules governing the observed amino acid substitutions.</p><p>Keyword:['energy']</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8828796>Chemical conjugation of -Pro--Pro.

The residues Tyr 95, Ala 138, Lys 145, Trp 153,  192, and  226 of HA of CA09 virus have found more interaction energies with human than avian receptors.

The molecular dynamics simulation was made to understand the different dynamical properties of HA and molecular interactions between HA of these two viruses with sialo-trisaccharide receptors of avian and human receptors.
