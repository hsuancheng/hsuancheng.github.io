In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a downward shift in temperature from an optimal reduces membrane fluidity, which triggers a  remodeling of the plasma membrane. How changes in membrane fluidity are perceived, and how the abundance and composition of different  classes is properly balanced, remain largely unknown. Here, we show that the levels of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate [PI(4,5)P], the most abundant plasma membrane phosphoinositide, drop rapidly in response to a downward shift in temperature. This change triggers a signaling cascade transmitted to cytosolic diphosphoinositol phosphate derivatives, among them 5-PP-IP and 1-IP, that exert regulatory functions on genes involved in the inositol and phospholipids (PLs) , and inhibit the activity of the protein kinase Pho85. Consistent with this, cold exposure triggers a specific program of neutral lipids and PLs changes. Furthermore, we identified Pho85 as playing a key role in controlling the synthesis of long-chain bases (LCBs) via the Ypk1-Orm2 regulatory circuit. We conclude that Pho85 orchestrates a coordinated response of  metabolic pathways that ensure yeast thermal adaptation.Copyright © 2019.

Cellular lipids can be synthesized in two different pathways: de novo by metabolizing hydrophilic substrates and ex novo by fermenting hydrophobic substrates. The aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of carbon source (glucose and olive oil) in the culture medium on the course of microbial oil accumulation in   cells. The level of selected gene expression by real time quantitative PCR method was investigated. The significant increase in expression of the  gene encoding acyl-CoA oxidase II, which preferentially oxidizes long-chain acyl-CoAs formed from substrate fatty acids incorporated inside the microbial cell, was observed in medium with olive oil in relation to glucose containing medium. Noteworthily, the presence of  carbon substrate did not inhibit the level of  gene transcription coding for ATP-citrate lyase, the key enzyme of the  de novo accumulation process. The present study indicated that de novo  biosynthesis could occur despite the presence of fatty acids in the medium, and the synthesis of storage lipids in the presence of  carbon substrates could be carried out with the use of both pathways (de novo and ex novo).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31683987>Inhibition of GSK3β Reduces Ectopic  Accumulation and Induces Autophagy by the AMPK Pathway in Goat Muscle Satellite Cells.</a></h1><p>Ectopic  accumulation in muscle is important not only for obesity and myopathy treatment, but also for meat quality improvement in farm animals. However, the molecular mechanisms involved in  in muscle satellite cells are still elusive. In this study, SB216763 reduced GSK3β activation by increasing the level of pGSK3β (Ser9) and decreasing the level of total GSK3β protein. GSK3β inhibition decreased  accumulation and downregulated the expression level of lipogenesis-related genes in the adipogenic differentiation of goat muscle satellite cells. Furthermore, SB216763 treatment increased the levels of pAMPKα (T172) and pACC (Ser79). Further, we found that GSK3β inhibition promoted levels of LC3B-II and reduced the protein levels of p62 to induce the autophagy in muscle satellite cells. Taken together, our results provide new insight into a critical function for GSK3β: modulating  accumulation in goat muscle satellite cells through activating the AMPK pathway.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694237>Effects of Endurance and Endurance-Strength Training on Endothelial Function in Women with Obesity: A Randomized Trial.</a></h1><p>Some investigations have demonstrated that a combined endurance-strength training is the most effective in the treatment of obesity. The aim of the research was to access how different trainings influence: endothelial function, , and risk of atherosclerosis in women with obesity. In a randomized trial, 39 obese women aged 28-62 completed endurance (n = 22, 60-80% HR) or combined training (n = 17, 20 minutes of strength exercises, 50-60% 1RM and 25 minutes of endurance training, 60-80% HR). Before and after the intervention vascular endothelial function (endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), blood total antioxidant capacity (TAC)), total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), triglycerides and C-reactive protein (CRP)as well as visceral adiposity index (VAI), total-body skeletal muscle mass and atherogenic index of plasma (AIP) were determined. After the trainings, in both groups total cholesterol and total-body skeletal muscle mass increased ( < 0.05). In the group undergoing combined training, lower ( < 0.05) VAI, AIP, CRP and LDL-C were noted. In the group undergoing endurance training TBARS concentration decreased ( < 0.01), while the HDL-C ( < 0.01) concentration as well as eNOS ( < 0.05) activity increased. No significant differences between groups were found, either before or after the programs.

Despite an increasing amount of people worldwide developing NAFLD and having it progress to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and potentially cirrhosis, there is still no approved therapy. Therefore, huge efforts are being made to find and develop a successful treatment. One of the special interests is understanding the liver-gut axis and especially the role of bile acids in the progression of NAFLD. Farnesoid X receptor (FXR)-agonists have been approved und used in other liver diseases, such as primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) and primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), and have shown signs of being able to decrease inflammation and potentially steatosis. This review will mainly focus on targets/ligands that play an important role in bile acid  and give an overview of ongoing clinical as well as pre-clinical trials. With the complexity of the issue, we did not aim at giving a complete review, rather highlighting important targets and potential treatments that could be approved for NAFLD/NASH treatment within the next few years.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31691574>Nrf2 mediates oxidative stress-induced  accumulation in adipocytes by increasing adipogenesis and decreasing lipolysis.</a></h1><p>Nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is a regulator of cellular oxidative stress and is also involved in  in adipocytes. However, it remains unknown whether Nrf2 is the link between oxidative stress and the induction of  accumulation in adipocytes.Here, we show that oxidative stress is markedly increased in white adipose tissue from mice with high- diet-induced or genetically (ob/ob)-induced obesity and from human subjects with obesity. Notably, in response to oxidative stress, Nrf2 expression and activity were induced, further promoting  accumulation in adipocytes and exacerbating the development of obesity. In contrast, Nrf2 ablation alleviated oxidative stress-induced  accumulation. Mechanistically, oxidative stress promoted Nrf2 recruitment to the SREBP-1 promoter, inducing target gene transcription and subsequent lipogenesis. Additionally, Nrf2 mediated oxidative stress-inhibited lipolysis in adipocytes via the PKA pathway. Innovation and Conclusion: Our data provide a novel insight that Nrf2, as a critical signaling node, links oxidative stress to the induction of  accumulation in adipocytes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696743>High- diet effects on the prostatic adenocarcinoma model and jaboticaba peel extract intake: protective response in metabolic disorders and liver histopathology.</a></h1><p>Prostate cancer (PCa), overweight and obesity are frequent worldwide health problems. Clinical studies have shown that increased high- diet (HFD) consumption is associated with higher incidence of PCa. Brazilian berries, such as  (Vell.) Berg, present high polyphenol concentration in the peel and exhibit positive effects on metabolic disorders and hepatic lesions. Therefore, the aim of the study herein was to investigate the patented jaboticaba peel extract effects (PJE) on different metabolic parameters and liver histopathology in the transgenic adenocarcinoma of the mouse prostate model, receiving a either normolipid diet or HFD for 8 weeks. The results showed that PJE reduced insulin resistance and glucose intolerance, decreased hepatic  accumulation, and inflammatory markers such as PPARγ and TNFα, respectively. In conclusion, the PJE treatment promoted protective effects in the  of insulin and glucose and liver imbalance caused by HFD intake in the PCa model, suggesting that it may be a good protector against metabolic disorders present in overweight and associated with PCa.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694752>Association of apolipoprotein B/apolipoprotein A1 ratio and cardiovascular events in rheumatoid arthritis: results of the CARMA study.</a></h1><p>To assess the plasma apolipoprotein B/apolipoprotein A1 ratio and its potential association with cardiovascular events (CVE) in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).A baseline analysis was made of the CARdiovascular in rheuMAtology Project (CARMA), a 10-year prospective study evaluating the presence of at least one CVE in 775 Spanish patients with RA. Of them, 29 had already experienced CVE prior to the inclusion in the study. We assessed the association between the elevation of the apoB/apoA1 ratio with the presence of CVE according to a logistic regression model for possible confounding factors. We also analysed the main parameters of activity of RA and parameters related to . RA patients were classified according to treatment: patients treated with disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs without biologics and those undergoing biologic therapy (anti-TNF-α, anti-IL-6 receptor, and other biologic agents).The apoB/apoA1 ratio of patients who had experienced CVE was higher than that of patients without previous CVE (0.65 vs. 0.60). However, the difference between both subgroups did not reach statistical significance (p=0.197). It was also the case after the multivariate analysis [OR: 1.48 (95% CI: 0.15-14.4); p=0.735]. RA patients from the group with CVE were more commonly receiving -lowering treatment with statins than those without CVE history (41.4% vs. 20%, p=0.005). High HAQ and high atherogenic index were significantly associated with the presence of CVE. There was no statistical association between the type of biologic therapy used in RA and the presence of CVE.No association between ApoB/apoA1 ratio and CVE was found at the baseline visit of patients with RA from the CARMA study.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31697717>Protein synthesis rates of muscle, tendon, ligament, cartilage, and bone tissue in vivo in humans.</a></h1><p>Skeletal muscle plasticity is reflected by a dynamic balance between protein synthesis and breakdown, with basal muscle tissue protein synthesis rates ranging between 0.02 and 0.09%/h. Though it is evident that other musculoskeletal tissues should also express some level of plasticity, data on protein synthesis rates of most of these tissues in vivo in humans is limited. Six otherwise healthy patients (62±3 y), scheduled to undergo unilateral total knee arthroplasty, were subjected to primed continuous intravenous infusions with L-[ring-13C6]-Phenylalanine throughout the surgical procedure. Tissue samples obtained during surgery included muscle, tendon, cruciate ligaments, cartilage, bone, menisci, , and synovium. Tissue-specific fractional protein synthesis rates (%/h) were assessed by measuring the incorporation of L-[ring-13C6]-Phenylalanine in tissue protein and were compared with muscle tissue protein synthesis rates using a paired t test. Tendon, bone, cartilage, Hoffa's  pad, anterior and posterior cruciate ligament, and menisci tissue protein synthesis rates averaged 0.06±0.01, 0.03±0.01, 0.04±0.01, 0.11±0.03, 0.07±0.02, 0.04±0.01, and 0.04±0.01%/h, respectively, and did not significantly differ from skeletal muscle protein synthesis rates (0.04±0.01%/h; P>0.05). Synovium derived protein (0.13±0.03%/h) and intercondylar notch bone tissue protein synthesis rates (0.03±0.01%/h) were respectively higher and lower compared to skeletal muscle protein synthesis rates (P<0.05 and P<0.01, respectively). Basal protein synthesis rates in various musculoskeletal tissues are within the same range of skeletal muscle protein synthesis rates, with fractional muscle, tendon, bone, cartilage, ligament, menisci, , and synovium protein synthesis rates ranging between 0.02 and 0.13% per hour in vivo in humans.

Inflammasome activation and IL-1β secretion are implicated in myocardial infarction (MI) and resultant heart failure; however, little is known about how macrophage lysosomes regulate these processes. In mice subjected to cardiac ischemia/reperfusion (IR) injury and humans with ischemic cardiomyopathy, we observed evidence of lysosomal impairment in macrophages. Inducible macrophage-specific overexpression of transcription factor EB (TFEB), a master regulator of lysosome biogenesis (Mϕ-TFEB), attenuated postinfarction remodeling, decreased abundance of proinflammatory macrophages, and reduced levels of myocardial IL-1β compared with controls. Surprisingly, neither inflammasome suppression nor Mϕ-TFEB-mediated attenuation of postinfarction myocardial dysfunction required intact ATG5-dependent macroautophagy (hereafter termed "autophagy"). RNA-seq of flow-sorted macrophages postinfarction revealed that Mϕ-TFEB upregulated key targets involved in lysosomal . Specifically, inhibition of the TFEB target, lysosomal acid lipase, in vivo abrogated the beneficial effect of Mϕ-TFEB on postinfarction ventricular function. Thus, TFEB reprograms macrophage lysosomal  to attenuate remodeling after IR, suggesting an alternative paradigm whereby lysosome function affects inflammation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693217>AMPK α1 mediates the protective effect of adiponectin against insulin resistance in INS-1 pancreatic β cells.</a></h1><p>The -derived protein adiponectin is known to reverse the effects of insulin resistance and to lower blood glucose levels. The AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signalling pathway plays a central role in  and energy homeostasis. Here, to investigate the role of AMPK in the protective effect of adiponectin against insulin resistance, we established the model of high-glucose (HG)- and high- (HL)-induced insulin resistance in INS-1 pancreatic β cells. We found that 25mM of glucose and 0.4mM of palmitic acid treatment significantly increased cell apoptosis and impaired insulin secretion in INS-1 cells. However, recombinant human adiponectin dramatically reduced HG- and/or HL-induced cell apoptosis and greatly improved insulin secretion. Interestingly, adiponectin treatment also activated AMPK signalling pathway by increasing the phosphorylation of Thr172 in the AMPK α subunit; 10μM of compound C, a potent AMPK inhibitor, blocked the protective effects of adiponectin against HG/HL-induced insulin resistance. Furthermore, knockout experiments by CRISPR/Cas9 technology showed that AMPK α1, but not AMPK α2, is involved in the protective effects of adiponectin. Taken together, adiponectin reversed the effects of insulin resistance via AMPK α1, which provides a novel insight into the protective mechanism of adiponectin and may be used as a new strategy for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY: Adiponectin can reverse the effects of insulin resistance and lower blood glucose levels. Here, adiponectin reduced HG/HL-induced cell apoptosis and greatly improved insulin secretion. These effects were blocked by AMPK inhibitor, compound C. Specifically, we found that AMPK α1, but not AMPK α2, mediates the protective effects of adiponectin, which provides a novel insight into the protective mechanism of adiponectin against insulin resistance.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672758>Relationship of obstructive sleep apnoea severity and subclinical systemic atherosclerosis.</a></h1><p>Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is a common form of sleep-disordered breathing. Untreated OSA might accelerate atherosclerosis, potentially increasing the cardiovascular disease burden in patients. The present study aimed to evaluate the association between objectively measured OSA severity and the presence of subclinical systemic atherosclerosis using non-invasive measurements, including tomographic quantification of the calcium burden.A total of 2157 participants of the Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study, who were free of structural heart disease and underwent both in-home polysomnography and chest computed tomography, were cross-sectionally analysed. Participants were divided into three groups based on the severity of OSA: no OSA (apnoea-hypopnea index [AHI]<5, n=1096), mild OSA (5≤AHI<15, n=700), and moderate-to-severe OSA (AHI≥15, n=361). Calcium deposits in the thoracic aorta and coronary arteries were measured by the Agatston score.Participants with moderate-to-severe OSA were 1.6 times (95% CI=1.18-2.15, p=0.002) more likely to have ascending thoracic aorta calcification (aTAC≥100 units) than those without OSA, after adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors. In addition, the association between moderate-to-severe OSA and aTAC of subjects with higher epicardial  volume (EFV) was slightly stronger than that in patients without OSA and lower EFV tertile (OR=2.11; 95% CI=1.30-3.43).Severity of OSA in the general population was independently associated with subclinical systemic atherosclerosis. These findings highlight the potential importance of severe OSA, especially in subjects with higher epicardial , as a possible predictive factor for systemic atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease.Copyright ©ERS 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31678511>Trichothecin inhibits invasion and metastasis of colon carcinoma associating with SCD-1-mediated metabolite alteration.</a></h1><p> metabolic abnormalities have received intensified concerns and increased de novo synthesis of lipids is recognized as a common feature of many human cancers. Nevertheless, the role of  that confers aggressive properties on human cancers still remains to be revealed. Natural compounds represent an abundant pool of agents for the discovery of novel lead compounds. Trichothecin (TCN) is a sesquiterpenoid originating from an endophytic fungus of the herbal plant Maytenus hookeri Loes. Here, we assess the association of stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD-1) over-expression with malignant progression of colorectal cancer (CRC). Based on this association, the effect of TCN on migration and invasion of colon carcinoma cells closely related to the inhibition of SCD-1 is evaluated. We further demonstrate that reduced production of unsaturated fatty acids (FAs) by blocking SCD-1 activity is beneficial for the anti-invasion effect of TCN. The aim of this study was to clarify the mechanistic connection between metabolite alterations induced by metabolic rewiring and the aggressive tumor phenotype and further develop novel pharmacological tools for the intervention of tumor invasion associated with SCD-1-mediated metabolite alterations.Copyright © 2019.

Despite greater intramuscular lipids, athletes are highly insulin sensitive, which could result from higher rates of insulin-stimulated glycogen synthesis or glucose transport/phosphorylation and oxidation. Thus, we examined the time course of muscle glycogen and glucose-6-phosphate concentrations during low and high systemic  availability.METHODSEight endurance-trained and 9 sedentary humans (VO2 peak: 56 ± 2 vs. 33 ± 2 mL/kg/min, P < 0.05) underwent 6-hour hyperinsulinemic-isoglycemic clamp tests with infusions of triglycerides or saline in a randomized crossover design. Glycogen and glucose-6-phosphate concentrations were monitored in vastus lateralis muscles using 13C/31P magnetic resonance spectroscopy.RESULTSAthletes displayed a 25% greater (P < 0.05) insulin-stimulated glucose disposal rate (Rd) than sedentary participants. During Intralipid infusion, insulin sensitivity remained higher in the athletes (ΔRd: 25 ± 3 vs. 17 ± 3 μmol/kg/min, P < 0.05), supported by higher glucose transporter type 4 protein expression than in sedentary humans. Compared to saline infusion, AUC of glucose-6-phosphate remained unchanged during Intralipid infusion in athletes (1.6 ± 0.2 mmol/L vs. 1.4 ± 0.2 [mmol/L] × h, P = n.s.) but tended to decrease by 36% in sedentary humans (1.7 ± 0.4 vs. 1.1 ± 0.1 [mmol/L] × h, P < 0.059). This drop was accompanied by a 72% higher rate of net glycogen synthesis in the athletes upon Intralipid infusion (47 ± 9 vs. 13 ± 3 μmol/kg/min, P < 0.05).CONCLUSIONAthletes feature higher skeletal muscle glucose disposal and glycogen synthesis during increased  availability, which primarily results from maintained insulin-stimulated glucose transport with increased myocellular glucose-6-phosphate levels for subsequent glycogen synthesis.TRIAL REGISTRATIONClinicalTrials.gov .FUNDINGGerman Federal Ministry of Health (BMG).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31690052>Dietary EPA Increases Rat Mortality in Diabetes Mellitus, A Phenomenon Which Is Compensated by Green Tea Extract.</a></h1><p> Diabetes is characterized by a high mortality rate which is often associated with heart failure. Green tea and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) are known to lessen some of the harmful impacts of diabetes and to exert cardio-protection. The aim of the study was to determine the effects of EPA, green tea extract (GTE), and a combination of both on the cardiac consequences of diabetes mellitus, induced in Wistar rats by injection of a low dose of streptozotocin (33 mg/kg) combined with a high  diet. Cardiac mechanical function, coronary reactivity, and parameters of oxidative stress, inflammation, and energy  were evaluated. In the context of diabetes, GTE alone limited several diabetes-related symptoms such as inflammation. It also slightly improved coronary reactivity and considerably enhanced . EPA alone caused the rapid death of the animals, but this effect was negated by the addition of GTE in the diet. EPA and GTE combined enhanced coronary reactivity considerably more than GTE alone.

Lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A (Lp-PLA) catalyzes the synthesis of pro-inflammatory lipids that recruit monocytes. Current guidelines for assessing cardiovascular risk in HIV-infected patients suggest that Lp-PLA may be a useful surrogate marker for CVD health in this patient population. Lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A, lipids, glucose, physical parameters, and carotid intimal-medial thickness (CIMT) were measured in 98 participants (49 HIV-uninfected, 27 antiretroviral therapy [ART]-naive PWH, and 22 ART-treated PWH).

In obesity, adipokines released from expanding adipose tissue are implicated in disease progression and metabolic dysfunction. However, mechanisms controlling the progression of adiposity and metabolic complications are not fully understood. It has been suggested that expanding  mass and sustained release of inflammatory adipokines in adipose tissue lead to hypoxia, oxidative stress, apoptosis, and cellular damage. These changes trigger an immune response involving infiltration of adipose tissue with immune cells, complement activation and generation of factors involved in opsonization and clearance of damaged cells. Abundant evidence now indicates that adipose tissue is an active secretory source of complement and complement-related adipokines that, in addition to their inflammatory role, contribute to the regulation of metabolic function. This article highlights advances in knowledge regarding the role of these adipokines in energy regulation of adipose tissue through modulating lipogenic and lipolytic pathways. Several adipokines will be discussed including adipsin, Factor H, properdin, C3a, Acylation-Stimulating Protein, C1q/TNF-related proteins, and response gene to complement-32 (RGC-32). Interactions between these factors will be described considering their immune-metabolic roles in the adipose tissue microenvironment and their potential contribution to progression of adiposity and metabolic dysfunction. The differential expression and the role of complement factors in gender-related  partitioning will also be addressed. Identifying lipogenic adipokines and their specific autocrine/paracrine roles may provide means for adipose-tissue-targeted therapeutic interventions that may disrupt the vicious circle of adiposity and disease progression. © 2019 American Physiological Society.

Many Archaea maintain the fluidity and permeability of their membranes by adjusting the number of cyclic moieties within the cores of their glycerol dibiphytanyl glycerol tetraether (GDGT) lipids. Cyclized GDGTs increase membrane packing and stability, which has been shown to help cells survive shifts in temperature and pH. However, the extent of this cyclization also varies with growth phase and electron acceptor or donor limitation. These observations indicate a relationship between energy  and membrane composition. Here we show that the average degree of GDGT cyclization increases with doubling time in continuous cultures of the thermoacidophile Sulfolobus acidocaldarius (DSM 639). This is consistent with the behavior of a mesoneutrophile, Nitrosopumilus maritimus SCM1. Together, these results demonstrate that archaeal GDGT distributions can shift in response to electron donor flux and energy availability, independent of pH or temperature. Paleoenvironmental reconstructions based on GDGTs thus capture the energy available to microbes, which encompasses fluctuations in temperature and pH, as well as electron donor and acceptor availability.

Endogenous EpFAs are further metabolized into corresponding diols by the soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH). Through inhibition of sEH, many studies have demonstrated the cardioprotective and renoprotective effects of EpFAs; however, the role of sEH inhibition in modulating the pathogenesis of neuroinflammatory disorders is less well described. In this review, we discuss the current knowledge surrounding the effects of sEH inhibition and EpFA action in neuroinflammatory disorders such as Parkinson's Disease (PD), stroke, depression, epilepsy, and Alzheimer's Disease (AD), as well as the potential mechanisms that underlie the therapeutic effects of sEH inhibition.Copyright © 2019.

In the current study, we show that crd1Δ cells exhibit decreased levels of glutamate and cysteine and are deficient in the essential antioxidant, glutathione, a tripeptide of glutamate, cysteine, and glycine. Glutathione is the most abundant non-protein thiol essential for maintaining intracellular redox potential in almost all eukaryotes, including yeast. Consistent with glutathione deficiency, the growth defect of crd1Δ cells at elevated temperature was rescued by supplementation of glutathione or glutamate and cysteine. Sensitivity to the oxidants iron (FeSO) and hydrogen peroxide (HO), was rescued by supplementation of glutathione. The decreased intracellular glutathione concentration in crd1Δ was restored by supplementation of glutamate and cysteine, but not by overexpressing YAP1, an activator of expression of glutathione biosynthetic enzymes. These findings show for the first time that CL plays a critical role in regulating intracellular glutathione .Copyright © 2019.

Among the  classes, levels of phospholipids, lysophospholipids, and cholesterol esters were impacted the most along with differential incorporation of stearic, palmitic, oleic and arachidonic acids. Integrated analysis with proteomic data suggested potential links to supplementation-mediated alterations in protein levels of phospholipases and pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 1 (PDK1).Associations between the observed differences in lipidemia, total triglyceride, and VLDL-cholesterol levels suggest that micronutrients may play a role in reducing these risk factors for cardiovascular disease in children.

Accumulating evidence has demonstrated that Wingless type 5a (Wnt5a) is implicated in cardiovascular diseases through non-canonical Wnt cascades. However, its precise role during the pathogenesis of AS is still unclear. Therefore, the present study aims to investigate the role and the underlying mechanism of Wnt5a/receptor tyrosine kinase-like orphan receptor 2 (Ror2) pathways in the promotion of AS process through affecting  accumulation and inflammation. In atherosclerotic clinical samples, Wnt5a levels were measured by using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) assay. In vivo experiments were conducted by using apolipoprotein E knockout (apoE) mice model. Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) were applied for in vitro studies. Wnt5a was highly expressed in both of atherosclerotic clinical samples and apoE mice. The knockdown of Wnt5a significantly inhibited cholesterol accumulation and inflammatory response. Additionally, the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammation aggravated the cholesterol accumulation and decreased adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) expression in VSMCs. Depletion of intracellular cholesterol by β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) led to the upregulation of ABCA1 and the inhibition of inflammation. Conversely, the overexpression of Wnt5a inhibited ABCA1 expression, facilitated cholesterol accumulation, impared cholesterol efflux, promoted NF-κB nuclear translocation and the inflammatory cytokines secretion. Moreover, the knockdown of Ror2 increased ABCA1 expression and reduced Wnt5a-induced cholesterol accumulation and inflammatory responses. Furthermore, the knockdown of ABCA1 enhanced cholesterol accumulation and inflammatory response. Therefore, Wnt5a/Ror2 pathway was critical in regulating cholesterol homeostasis and inflammatory response, which might be a promising therapeutic target for AS therapy.Copyright © 2019.

The aim of this evidence synthesis was to summarize the available evidence in order to update the European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD) clinical practice guidelines for nutrition therapy. We conducted a systematic review and, where appropriate, meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) carried out in people with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) (six studies) or dysmetabolism (one study) to answer the following questions: What is the evidence that T2D is preventable by lifestyle changes? What is the optimal diet (with a particular focus on diet quality) for prevention, and does the prevention of T2D result in a lower risk of late complications of T2D? The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was applied to assess the certainty of the trial evidence. Altogether seven RCTs (N = 4090) fulfilled the eligibility criteria and were included in the meta-analysis. The diagnosis of incident diabetes was based on an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). The overall risk reduction of T2D by the lifestyle interventions was 0.53 (95% CI 0.41; 0.67). Most of the trials aimed to reduce weight, increase physical activity, and apply a diet relatively low in saturated  and high in fiber. The PREDIMED trial that did not meet eligibility criteria for inclusion in the meta-analysis was used in the final assessment of diet quality. We conclude that T2D is preventable by changing lifestyle and the risk reduction is sustained for many years after the active intervention (high certainty of evidence). Healthy dietary changes based on the current recommendations and the Mediterranean dietary pattern can be recommended for the long-term prevention of diabetes. There is limited or insufficient data to show that prevention of T2D by lifestyle changes results in a lower risk of cardiovascular and microvascular complications.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672575>Adipose tissue as a target for second-generation (atypical) antipsychotics: A molecular view.</a></h1><p>Schizophrenia is a neuropsychiatric disorder that chronically affects 21 million people worldwide. Second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) are the cornerstone in the management of schizophrenia. However, despite their efficacy in counteracting both positive and negative symptomatology of schizophrenia, recent clinical observations have described an increase in the prevalence of metabolic disturbances in patients treated with SGAs, including abnormal weight gain, hyperglycemia and dyslipidemia. While the molecular mechanisms responsible for these side-effects remain poorly understood, increasing evidence points to a link between SGAs and adipose tissue depots of white, brown and beige adipocytes. In this review, we survey the present knowledge in this area, with a particular focus on the molecular aspects of adipocyte biology including differentiation, , thermogenic function and the browning/beiging process.Copyright © 2019.

However, little is known about serine  in fatty liver disease (FLD). We aimed to investigate the changes in serine biosynthetic pathways in humans and animal models of fatty liver and their contribution to the development of FLD.High- diet (HFD)-induced steatosis and methionine-choline-deficient diet-induced steatohepatitis animal models were employed. Human serum samples were obtained from patients with FLD whose proton density  fraction was estimated by magnetic resonance imaging. 3-Phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (Phgdh)-knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) and transgenic mice overexpressing Phgdh (Tg-phgdh) were used to evaluate the role of serine  in the development of FLD.Expression of Phgdh was markedly reduced in the animal models. There were significant negative correlations of the serum serine with the liver  fraction, serum alanine transaminase, and triglyceride levels among patients with FLD. Increased  accumulation and reduced NAD and SIRT1 activity were observed in Phgdh-knockout MEF and primary hepatocytes incubated with free fatty acids; these effects were reversed by overexpression of Phgdh. Tg-Phgdh mice showed significantly reduced hepatic triglyceride accumulation compared with wild-type littermates fed a HFD, which was accompanied by increased SIRT1 activity and reduced expression of lipogenic genes and proteins.Human and experimental data suggest that reduced Phgdh expression and serine levels are closely associated with the development of FLD.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Many researchers have studied the most common chloropropanol contaminant, 3-monochloropropane-1,2-diol (3-MCPD), as well as its  ester derivatives. A plethora of toxicological outcomes have been described in vivo, including effects on the heart, nervous system, reproductive organs, and kidneys. To better understand the concordance of some of these effects to in vitro outcomes, we focused our research on using an in vitro cellular model to investigate whether the proximal tubule cells of the kidney would be vulnerable to the effects of free 3-MCPD and nine of its common esters in commercial formula. Using the established human kidney proximal tubule cell line, HK-2, we performed 24-h treatments using 3-MCPD and nine mono- or di-esters derived from palmitate, oleate, and linoleate. By directly exposing HK-2 cells at treatment doses ranging from 0 to 100 μM, we could evaluate their effects on cell viability, mitochondrial health, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and other endpoints of toxicity. Since chloropropanols reportedly inhibit cellular  through interference with glycolysis, we also tested the extent of this mechanism. Overall, we found mild but statistically significant evidence of cytotoxicity at the highest tested treatment concentrations, which were also associated with mitochondrial dysfunction and transient perturbations in cellular . Based on these findings, further studies will be required to better understand the effects of these compounds under conditions that are more physiologically relevant to human infant and toddler proximal tubules in order to mimic their exposure to chloropropanol-containing foods.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671915>1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D Decreases Tertiary Butyl-Hydrogen Peroxide-Induced Oxidative Stress and Increases AMPK/SIRT1 Activation in C2C12 Muscle Cells.</a></h1><p>Enhanced oxidative stress has been associated with muscle mitochondrial changes and metabolic disorders. Thus, it might be a good strategy to decrease oxidative stress and improve mitochondrial changes in skeletal muscle. In the present study, we investigate the role of the most biologically active metabolite of vitamin D, 1,25-dihyroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)2D) in oxidative stress and mitochondrial changes in tertiary butyl-hydrogen (tBHP)-treated C2C12 muscle cells. Differentiated C2C12 muscle cells were pretreated with tBHP, followed by 1,25(OH)2D for additional 24 h. An exogenous inducer of oxidative stress, tBHP significantly increased oxidative stress,  peroxidation, intracellular damage, and cell death which were reversed by 1,25(OH)2D in C2C12 myotubes. 1.25(OH)2D improves tBHP-induced mitochondrial morphological changes such as swelling, irregular cristae, and smaller size and number, as observed by transmission electron microscope. In addition, 1,25(OH)2D treatment increases mtDNA contents as well as gene expression involved in mitochondrial biogenesis such as PGC1α, NRF1, and Tfam. Significant increments in mRNA levels related to antioxidant enzymes such as Nrf2, HMOX1, and TXNRD1, myogenic differentiation markers including myoglobin, muscle creatine kinase (MCK), and MHCІ and ІІ, and vitamin D  such as CYP24, CYP27, and vitamin D receptor (VDR) were found in 1,25(OH)2D-treated myotubes. Moreover, upon t-BHP-induced oxidative stress, significant incremental changes in nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) levels, activities of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)/sirtulin 1 (SIRT1), and SIRT1 expression were noted in 1,25(OH)2D-treated C2C12 muscle cells. Taken together, these results suggest the observed potent inhibitory effect of 1,25(OH)2D on muscle oxidative stress and mitochondrial dynamics might be at least involved in the activation of AMPK and SIRT1 activation in muscle cells.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31676115>Detection techniques of carboxylesterase activity: An update review.</a></h1><p>Mammalian carboxylesterases (CESs) are essential members of serine esterase hydrolase superfamily, which are widely distributed in many tissues including liver, intestine, lung and kidney.

We summarize recent discoveries of the roles that the eCBome plays within peripheral tissues in diabetes, and how it is being targeted, in an effort to develop novel therapeutics for the treatment of this increasingly prevalent disease.As with the eCB system, many eCBome members regulate several physiological processes, including energy intake and storage, glucose and  and pancreatic health, which contribute to the development of type 2 diabetes (T2D). Preclinical studies increasingly support the notion that targeting the eCBome may beneficially affect T2D. The eCBome is implicated in T2D at several levels and in a variety of tissues, making this complex  signaling system a potential source of many potential therapeutics for the treatments for T2D.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31677009>Effects of Docosahexaenoic Acid and Its Peroxidation Product on Amyloid-β Peptide-Stimulated Microglia.</a></h1><p>Growing evidence suggests that docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) exerts neuroprotective effects, although the mechanism(s) underlying these beneficial effects are not fully understood. Here we demonstrate that DHA, but not arachidonic acid (ARA), suppressed oligomeric amyloid-β peptide (oAβ)-induced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in primary mouse microglia and immortalized mouse microglia (BV2). Similarly, DHA but not ARA suppressed oAβ-induced increases in phosphorylated cytosolic phospholipase A (p-cPLA), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) in BV2 cells. LC-MS/MS assay indicated the ability for DHA to cause an increase in 4-hydroxyhexenal (4-HHE) and suppress oAβ-induced increase in 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE). Although oAβ did not alter the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathway, exogenous DHA, ARA as well as low concentrations of 4-HHE and 4-HNE upregulated this pathway and increased production of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) in microglial cells. These results suggest that DHA modulates ARA  in oAβ-stimulated microglia through suppressing oxidative and inflammatory pathways and upregulating the antioxidative stress pathway involving Nrf2/HO-1. Understanding the mechanism(s) underlying the beneficial effects of DHA on microglia should shed light into nutraceutical therapy for the prevention and treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31675622>Markers of bone and  with eslicarbazepine acetate monotherapy.</a></h1><p>To evaluate the impact of eslicarbazepine acetate (ESL) monotherapy on markers of bone and .We conducted a post-hoc analysis of data pooled from two Phase III, dose-blind, conversion-to-ESL (1600 mg and 1200 mg) monotherapy studies in patients with focal seizures. Laboratory measurements included lipids (total cholesterol [TC]; high-density lipoprotein cholesterol [HDL-C]; low-density lipoprotein cholesterol; and triglycerides) and markers of bone  (alkaline phosphatase; 25-hydroxyvitamin D; osteocalcin; and parathyroid hormone [PTH]); measurements were taken at baseline, Week 18, and Month 12, and analyzed according to enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs (EIAEDs) use at baseline (+EIAED and -EIAED subgroups).Data from 337 treatment-compliant patients were used for the Week 18 analyses (+EIAED subgroup, n = 119; -EIAED subgroup, n = 218); data from 161 treatment-compliant patients were used for the Month 12 analyses (+EIAED subgroup, n = 53; -EIAED subgroup, n = 108). At baseline, alkaline phosphatase and PTH concentrations were higher in the + EIAED versus -EIAED subgroup. Changes from baseline in markers of bone turnover were generally insignificant, except for some elevation in alkaline phosphatase in the -EIAED subgroup (18 weeks and 12 months) and osteocalcin in both subgroups (18 weeks only). Regarding lipids, TC and HDL-C concentrations were higher in the + EIAED versus -EIAED subgroup at baseline. Concentrations of markers of  fell in the + EIAED group and rose in the -EIAED group, reaching very similar values that were intermediate between the -EIAED and + EIAED baseline values.Based on this retrospective analysis, ESL seems to have had only a modest and primarily clinically insignificant impact on plasma lipids.

The MFC supplement (658 mg flavonoids, split dose 8:30, 13:00) contained quercetin, green tea catechins, and anthocyanins from bilberry extract, and 214 mg caffeine. Participants were measured twice in a metabolic chamber for a day, four weeks apart, with outcomes including 22 h EE (8:30-6:30), substrate utilization from the respiratory quotient (RQ), plasma caffeine levels (16:00), and genotyping for the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs762551. Areas under the curve (AUC) for metabolic data from the MFC and PL trials were calculated using the trapezoid rule, with a mixed linear model (GLM) used to evaluate the overall treatment effect. The 22 h oxygen consumption and EE were significantly higher with MFC than PL (1582 ± 143, 1535 ± 154 kcal/day, respectively,  = 0.003, trial difference of 46.4 ± 57.8 kcal/day). FATox trended higher for MFC when evaluated using GLM (99.2 ± 14.0, 92.4 ± 14.4 g/22 h,  = 0.054). Plasma caffeine levels were significantly higher in the MFC versus PL trial (5031 ± 289, 276 ± 323 ng/mL, respectively,  < 0.001). Trial differences for 22 h EE and plasma caffeine were unrelated after controlling for age and body mass ( = -0.249,  = 0.139), and not different for participants with the homozygous allele 1, A/A, compared to C/A and C/C ( = 0.50 and 0.56, respectively). In conclusion, EE was higher for MFC compared to PL, and similar to effects estimated from previous trials using caffeine alone. A small effect of the MFC on FATox was measured, in contrast to inconsistent findings previously reported for this caffeine dose. The trial variance for 22 h EE was not significantly related to the variance in plasma caffeine levels or CYP1A2*1F allele carriers and non-carriers.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31678111>Heat shock response to exercise in pancreatic islets of obese mice.</a></h1><p>Chronic obesity imposes an organismal state of low-grade inflammation because the physiological resolution of inflammation is progressively repressed giving rise to cellular senescence and its accompanying Senescence-Associated Secretory Phenotype (SASP), which avoids apoptosis but perpetuates the relay of inflammatory signals from adipose tissue toward the rest the body. Conversely, resolution of inflammation depends on the integrity of heat shock response (HSR) pathway that leads to the expression of cytoprotective and anti-inflammatory protein chaperones of the 70 kDa family (HSP70). However, chronic exposure to the aforementioned injuring factors leads to SASP, which, in turn, suppress the HSR. A main metabolic tissue severely jeopardized by obesity-related dysfunctions is the endocrine pancreas, particularly β-cells of the islets of Langerhans. Because exercise is a powerful inducer of HSR and predicted to alleviate negative health outcomes of obesity, we sought whether obesity influence HSP70 expression in pancreatic islets and other metabolic tissues (adipose tissue and skeletal muscle) of adult B6.129SF2/J mice fed on a high- diet (HFD) for 13 weeks since the weaning and whether acute exercise as well as moderate-intensity exercise training (8 weeks) could interfere with this scenario. We showed that acute exercise of moderate intensity protects pancreatic islets against cytokine-induced cell death. In addition, acute exercise challenge time-dependently increased islet HSP70 that peaked at 12 h post-exercise in both trained and untrained mice fed on a control diet, suggesting an adequate HSR to exercise training. Unexpectedly, however, neither exercise training nor acute exercise challenges were able to increase islet HSP70 contents in trained mice submitted to HFD, but only in untrained HFD animals. In parallel, HFD disrupted glycemic status which is accompanied by loss of muscular mass resembling sarcopenic obesity that could not be rescued by exercise training. These results suggest that exercise influences HSR in pancreatic islets but obesity undermines islet, muscle and adipose tissue HSR, which is associated with metabolic abnormalities observed in such tissues.Copyright © 2019.

SOD3 expression and release were evaluated in adipocytes differentiated from primary human preadipocytes and murine bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells. The regulatory role for SOD3 was determined by SOD3 lentivirus knockdown in human adipocytes and global SOD3 KO mice. SOD3 was expressed at high levels in white adipose tissue and adipocytes were the main cells expressing SOD3 in adipose tissue. SOD3 expression was significantly elevated in adipose tissue of HFD-fed mice. Moreover, SOD3 expression and release were markedly increased in differentiated human adipocytes and adipocytes differentiated from mouse bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells compared to undifferentiated cells. In addition, SOD3 silencing in human adipocytes increased expression of genes involved in  metabolic pathways such as PPARγ and SREBP1c and promoted the accumulation of triglyceride. Finally, global SOD3 KO mice were more obese and insulin resistant with enlarged adipose tissue and increased triglyceride accumulation.Our data showed that SOD3 is secreted from adipocytes and regulates  in adipose tissue. This important discovery may open up new avenues of research for the cytoprotective role of SOD3 in obesity and its associated metabolic disorders.SOD3 is a protective factor secreted by adipocytes in response to HFD-induced obesity and regulates adipose tissue .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31690730>Metformin induces  changes on sphingolipid species and oxidized lipids in polycystic ovary syndrome women.</a></h1><p>Metformin is one of the treatments used for PCOS pathology decreasing body weight, plasma androgen, FSH and glucose levels. Unfortunately, there is little known about metformin's effects on , a crucial process in PCOS pathology. We have employed a lipidomic approach to explore alterations in the plasma  profile of patients with PCOS following metformin treatment. The aim is to offer new insights about the effect of metformin in PCOS patients. Plasma samples were obtained from 27 subjects prior to and following 12 weeks of metformin treatment. A detailed biochemical characterization and lipidomic profile was performed. Metformin reduces BMI, HOMA-IR, FSH and androstenedione and increases DHEA-S but no changes were found in glucose levels after treatment. Multivariate statistics revealed a specific lipidomic signature due to the effect of 12 weeks of metformin treatment in PCOS patients. This signature includes changes in sphingolipid  suggesting a crosstalk between these  species and the androgenic  and a decrease in oxidized lipids reinforcing that metformin treatment improves oxidative stress status.

Diabetes is a chronic disease, and metabolic factors affecting brain metabolisms, such as serum glucose, insulin, and glucagon, are altered according to disease progression. In our previous study, we applied hyperpolarized [1-C] pyruvate magnetic resonance spectroscopy in prediabetic mice after feeding them a 60% high- diet (HFD) for 6 months. Ultimately, we detected significantly increased [1-C]lactate conversion in the whole brain and an almost five-fold increased [1-C]lactate/pyruvate ratio in the hippocampal region. In the present study, we induced diabetes in mice by injecting streptozotocin and feeding them an HFD for 6 months. Unlike in prediabetic mice, [1-C]lactate conversion in the diabetic mice did not differ from that in the control group, but [1-C]lactate/total C ratio showed an almost 1.4-fold increase in the hippocampal region. We measured the amount of the lactate and mRNA levels of glucose transporters from isolated hippocampus and cortex samples. In the hippocampus, significantly decreased GLUT1 mRNA levels and increased lactate were detected, suggesting an inconsistency between glucose and pyruvate . Pyruvate can be produced from oxaloacetate as well as glucose. We investigated ATP citrate lyase (ACLY) because it cleaves citrate into oxaloacetate and acetyl CoA. Phosphorylated ACLY (Ser455), the active form, was increased in both hippocampus and cortex samples of mice injected with streptozotocin and fed an HFD. Also, phosphorylated ACLY/total ACLY showed a positive correlation with lactate amount in the hippocampus. Our results suggest that the brain has different responses to diabetic progression, but, in the hippocampus, maintains metabolic alteration toward increasing lactate production from the prediabetic to the diabetic stage. We suggest that ACLY-mediated pyruvate be used to support lactate levels in the hippocampus in cases of limited glucose availability.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31681171>Obesity and Cardiometabolic Risk Factors in Children and Young Adults With Non-classical 21-Hydroxylase Deficiency.</a></h1><p> Classical congenital adrenal hyperplasia is associated with an increased risk of obesity and cardiometabolic disease. The aim of the study was to determine if this is also true for non-classical congenital adrenal hyperplasia (NCCAH).  A retrospective, cross-sectional, single-center study design was used. Data were collected on 114 patients (92 female) with NCCAH diagnosed during childhood/adolescence at a tertiary medical center. Patients were classified by treatment status at the last clinic visit. Outcome measures were assessed at diagnosis and the last clinic visit: weight status, body composition, blood pressure,  profile, and glucose . The prevalence of overweight/obesity was compared to the parental prevalence, and for patients aged 11-20 years, to the Israeli National Survey.  Mean age was 7.9 ± 4.2 years at diagnosis and 17.1 ± 6.9 years at the last follow-up. At the last clinic visit, 76 patients were under treatment with glucocorticoids, 27 were off-treatment (previously treated), and 11 had never been treated. The rate of obesity (11.4%) was similar to the parental rates, and the rate of overweight was significantly lower.

Osteocalcin (OC) could regulate testosterone secretion and energy , but it remains unknown whether such an effect exists in IHH patients. Our study is aimed to examine the relationship between serum OC levels with testosterone and its responsiveness to gonadotropin stimulation and metabolic profiles in male IHH patients. A total of 99 male patients aged 18-37 years and diagnosed with IHH were enrolled in the current study, and the relationships between OC and testicular volume, baseline total testosterone (TT), free testosterone (FT), and peak TT (Tmax) levels after human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) stimulation, gonadotropin responsiveness index (GRI), which is calculated by dividing Tmax by testicular volume, as well as metabolic profiles, such as 2-h post-challenge glucose (2hPG) and  percentage (%), were analyzed. The results showed that OC had an independent negative relationship with testicular volume ( = -0.253,  = 0.012) and a positive association with Tmax ( = 0.262,  = 0.014) after adjusting for confounders. In addition, OC was a major determinant of GRI (adjusted   for the model = 0.164,  = 0.012), % (adjusted   for the model = 0.100,  = 0.004), and 2hPG (adjusted   for the model = 0.054,  = 0.013) in IHH patients. In conclusion, OC is associated with testosterone secretion upon gonadotropin stimulation, glucose , and  mass variations in IHH.

SCFAs are known to improve host  but their underlying mechanism of action remains elusive. In this study, sixteen growing pigs were infused with saline or sodium propionate solution (25 mL, 2 mol/L), respectively through a cecal fistula twice a day during a 28 days experimental period. The results showed that the cecal infusion of the SCFA propionate decreased serum and liver triglyceride levels, and increased serum PYY secretion in growing pigs. Hepatic metabolomics identified 12 metabolites that were significantly altered by propionate. These included decreased levels of  related stearic acid and glycerol-2-phosphate; increased levels of TCA cycle components including malic acid, fructose-6-phosphate, and succinic acid; and decreased levels of the amino acid  products aspartic acid and serine. Hepatic transcriptomics demonstrated that propionate inhibited fatty acid synthesis and promoted  metabolic process. Pathway enrichment analysis showed that propionate accelerated gluconeogenesis and decreased glycolysis. Taken together, these data support a role of the SCFA propionate on host  and glucose .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31677208>β-cell Function, Incretin Response, and Insulin Sensitivity of Glucose and  in Obese Youth: Relationship to OGTT Time to Glucose Peak.</a></h1><p>In adults, the time to glucose peak at or after 30 min during an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) identifies physiologically distinct groups with differences in insulin sensitivity, β-cell function and risk for type 2 diabetes. In obese non-diabetic adolescents, we investigated if the OGTT-time-to-glucose-peak also reflects incretin and free fatty acid (FFA) responses besides insulin sensitivity and β-cell function, measured by the clamp.Obese adolescents (n=278) were categorized according to their OGTT-time-to-glucose-peak by Early-peak (at 30 min) vs. Late-peak (>30 min) groups. Body composition, visceral adipose tissue, oral disposition index (oDI) and OGTT-area under the curve (AUC) were examined. A subset of 102 participants had both hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic and hyperglycemic clamps to measure in vivo insulin sensitivity, insulin secretion, and β-cell function relative to insulin sensitivity.Compared with the Early-peak group, the Late-peak group had impaired β-cell function relative to insulin sensitivity, lower glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP)-AUC, and higher FFA-AUC despite higher insulin and C-peptide-AUC. They also had lower hepatic and peripheral insulin sensitivity despite similar percent body  and visceral adipose tissue, and had higher prevalence of impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) (all P<0.05).In obese non-diabetic youth, those with a Late-peak vs. an Early-peak glucose during an OGTT showed diminished β-cell function, blunted incretin secretion, and lower insulin sensitivity of glucose and FFA . It remains to be determined if Late-peak glucose predicts the future development of type 2 diabetes in these high-risk youth. This article is protected by copyright.

Despite significant advances in the diagnosis and treatment of cancer, survival rates are still insufficient in progressive cancers. Today, one of the most important reasons for not being able to reach the desired level in the fight against progressive cancer types is cancer stem cells (CSCs). The ineffectiveness of conventional therapies on CSCs has made it necessary to investigate the molecular mechanisms and signaling pathways used in the survival, drug resistance, and metastasis of CSCs. In this context, studies investigating the biology of CSCs suggest that  and extracellular vesicles are critical for understanding the stemness and metastasis of these cells. These studies have demonstrated that a number of molecules play a vital role in resistant to apoptosis in CSCs, including the cellular FLICE-inhibitor protein (c-FLIP), which inhibits TRAIL-induced extrinsic apoptosis. Another important output of these studies is the demonstration of the relationship of the cancer microenvironment in terms of epithelial-mesenchymal transition, which CSCs frequently use in the metastasis process. In addition, studies investigating the differences in glycosylation observed in CSCs and investigating cancer vaccines are promisng. These findings will strengthen our aresnal in the fight against cancer.

It is mainly formed via  of arachidonic acid by cyclooxygenases (COX) and the terminal enzyme microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1 (mPGES-1). Widely used non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) inhibit COX activity, resulting in decreased PGE production and symptomatic relief. However, NSAIDs block the production of many other  mediators that have important physiological and resolving actions, and these drugs cause gastrointestinal bleeding and/or increase the risk for severe cardiovascular events. Selective inhibition of downstream mPGES-1 for reduction in only PGE biosynthesis is suggested as a safer therapeutic strategy. This review covers the recent advances in characterization of new mPGES-1 inhibitors in preclinical models and their future clinical applications.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

BCAA may promote insulin resistance through either mTOR-mediated suppression of insulin receptor substrate-1 or through the accumulation of toxic BCAA catabolites. Although the link between circulating BCAA and insulin resistance has been consistent, it has yet to be concluded if BCAA causally contribute to the development or worsening of insulin resistance. This work investigated the effect of leucine both with and without varying levels of insulin resistance on , metabolic gene expression, and insulin signaling. C2C12 myotubes were treated with and without varied concentrations of leucine up to 2mM for 24 hours both with and without varied levels of insulin resistance. Gene and protein expression were measured via qRT-PCR and western blot, respectively. Mitochondrial  was measured via O consumption. Leucine at 2mM increased oxidative  as well as gene expression of mitochondrial biogenesis, which was associated with increased cellular  content. Despite increased  content of leucine-treated cells, neither acute nor chronic leucine treatment at 2mM affected insulin signaling in insulin sensitive, mildly insulin resistant, or severely insulin resistant cells. Similarly, leucine at lower concentrations (0.25mM, 0.5mM, and 1mM) did not alter insulin signaling either, regardless of insulin resistance. Leucine appears to improve myotube oxidative  and related metabolic gene expression. And despite increased  content of leucine-treated cells, leucine does not appear to alter insulin sensitivity either acutely or chronically, regardless of level of insulin resistance.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V. and Société Française de Biochimie et Biologie Moléculaire (SFBBM).

Due to its poor clinical prognosis, increasing the diagnostic rate of HCC is urgently needed. Herein, we validate discovered metabolomic biomarkers to distinguish Hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related HCC, including alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) negative (AFP-) and positive (AFP+) individuals.  We recruited 130 HCC subjects (independent case-control, randomized clinical cohorts) to our study. We separated the subjects randomly into two panels: (1) 58 individuals for the discovery panel; and (2) 72 individuals for the validation panel. For each panel, gender and age-matched hepatitis B group (HBG) and healthy group were included as controls. Plasma samples were collected for metabolic profiling by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-based metabolomics assays. We applied both non-targeted metabolomics analyses and targeted metabolomics analyses. Significantly changed metabolites (SCMs) were identified. The power of SCMs to discriminate HCC and HBG or healthy group was determined by receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis.  Ten SCMs were selected form the discovery panel, and further verified in the validation panel. ROC analyses indicated that 1 SCMs (LysoPC (24:0)) could discriminate HCC from HBG (AUC = 0.765). Further, 8 SCMs including (LysoPC (17:0), LysoPC (20:4(8Z,11Z,14Z,17Z)), LysoPC (22:0), LysoPC (24:0), PE (P-16:0/22:4(7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z)), SM (d18:1/22:1(13Z)), Creatinine, and L-Isoleucine) displayed a heightened ability to discriminate between HCC and healthy controls (AUC were more than 0.800). Most of these SCMs were important in .  LysoPC (24:0) could distinguished HCC from HBG, and 8 SCMs distinguished HCC from healthy controls.

SR-B1 and CD36 share an affinity for a wide array of ligands. Although they exhibit similar ligand binding specificity, SR-B1 and CD36 have some very specific  transport functions. Whereas SR-B1 primarily facilitates the selective delivery of cholesteryl esters (CEs) and cholesterol from HDL particles to the liver and non-placental steroidogenic tissues, as well as participating in cholesterol efflux from cells, CD36 primarily mediates the uptake of long-chain fatty acids in high fatty acid-requiring organs such as the heart, skeletal muscle and adipose tissue. However, CD36 also mediates cholesterol efflux and facilitates selective lipoprotein-CE delivery, although less efficiently than SR-B1. Interestingly, the ability or efficiency of SR-B1 to mediate fatty acid uptake has not been reported. In this paper, using overexpression and siRNA-mediated knockdown of SR-B1, we show that SR-B1 possesses the ability to facilitate fatty acid uptake. Moreover, this function is not blocked by BLT-1, a specific chemical inhibitor of HDL-CE uptake activity of SR-B1, nor by sulfo-N-succinimidyl oleate, which inhibits fatty acid uptake by CD36. Attenuated fatty acid uptake was also observed in primary adipocytes isolated from SR-B1 knockout mice. In conclusion, facilitation of fatty acid uptake is an additional function that is mediated by SR-B1.Copyright © 2019.

This study aims to explore the relationship between TSH levels and metabolic factors in euthyroid individuals.A total of 2,663 subjects were enrolled from a nationwide population-based cross-sectional survey of iodine nutrition, thyroid disease and diabetes in China (2014-2017). Euthyroid individuals were divided into four groups according to quartiles of TSH levels: group A (n=305, 0.3-1.3 mIU/L), group B (n=829, 1.3-2.2 mIU/L), group C (n=673, 2.2-3.2 mIU/L) and group D (n=349, 3.2-4.2 mIU/L). Anthropometric parameters, biochemical indicators and TSH levels were determined.A total of 2,156 euthyroid subjects with serum TSH levels within the normal range accounted for 86.8% of the sample. The systolic blood pressure (SBP) in group D was significantly higher than that in the other three groups. Group C displayed significantly lower thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPOAb) levels than the other three groups. Group C also had lower anti-thyroglobulin antibody (TgAb) levels than groups A and D, whereas the TgAb levels in group B were only lower than those in group A. Spearman's or Pearson's linear regression analysis showed that SBP (r=0.054; =0.013) was positively correlated with TSH, but cholesterol (TC) (r=-0.043, =0.047) was negatively correlated with TSH. Multiple stepwise regression analysis revealed that SBP, the urinary iodine concentration (UIC), waist circumference (WC), body mass index (BMI), TC, triglycerides (TGs) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) were independent predictors of serum TSH levels.This large population-based study demonstrates a significant interaction between metabolic factors and TSH levels. An adverse weight status, high blood pressure levels, blood  disorder and excessive iodine intake may be early manifestations of thyroid disease in euthyroid subjects.© 2019 Ren et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31685417>Metastatic pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma: Management of endocrine manifestations, surgery and ablative procedures, and systemic therapies.</a></h1><p>Metastatic pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas (MPPGs) are rare neuroendocrine tumors. Most patients present with advanced disease that is associated with manifestations of catecholamine release. Surgical resection of the primary tumor and ablative therapies of metastases-whenever possible-may improve clinical outcomes and, perhaps, lengthen the patient's overall survival. Significant steps in understanding the genetic alterations linked to MPPGs and scientific progress made on cancers that share a similar pathogenesis are leading to the recognition of potential systemic therapeutic options. Data derived from clinical trials evaluating targeted therapies such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors, radiopharmaceuticals, immunotherapy, and combinations of these will likely improve the outcomes of patients with advanced and progressive MPPGs. Exemplary of this success is the recent approval in the United States of the high-specific-activity iodine meta-iodine-benzylguanidine (MIBG) for patients with unresectable and progressive MPPGs that express the noradrenaline transporter.

To identify HAMLET's bacterial targets, here we used Streptococcus pneumoniae as a model organism and employed a proteomic approach that identified several potential candidates. Two of these targets were the glycolytic enzymes fructose bis-phosphate aldolase (FBPA) and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). Treatment of pneumococci with HAMLET immediately inhibited their ATP and lactate production, suggesting that HAMLET inhibits glycolysis. This observation was supported by experiments with recombinant bacterial enzymes, along with biochemical and bacterial viability assays, indicating that HAMLET's activity is partially inhibited by high glucose-mediated stimulation of glycolysis but enhanced in the presence of the glycolysis inhibitor 2-deoxyglucose. Both HAMLET and ALA bound directly to each glycolytic enzyme in solution and solid phase assays and effectively inhibited their enzymatic activities. In contrast, oleic acid alone had little to no inhibitory activity. However, ALA alone also exhibited no bactericidal activity and did not block glycolysis in whole cells, suggesting a role for the  moiety in the internalization of HAMLET into the bacterial cells to reach its target(s). This was verified by inhibition of enzyme activity in whole cells after HAMLET but not ALA exposure. The results of this study suggest that part of HAMLET's antibacterial activity relates to its ability to target and inhibit glycolytic enzymes, providing an example of a natural antimicrobial agent that specifically targets glycolysis.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31686320>Regulation of glucose and  in health and disease.</a></h1><p>Glucose and fatty acids are the major sources of energy for human body.

First, we conducted a sex-stratified GWA study in a discovery sample (2,231 men and 2,431 women) and replication sample (2,599 men and 3,109 women) to identify SNPs influencing log-transformed HDL-C in Japanese participants in the baseline survey of Japan Multi-Institutional Collaborative Cohort Study. We also replicated previously reported HDL-C-related SNPs in a combined (discovery plus replication) sample (4,830 men and 5,540 women). We then analyzed the interactions of the HDL-C-related SNPs with PA on HDL-C. The sex-stratified GWA analyses identified 11 and 10 HDL-C-related SNPs in men and women as targets for an interaction analysis. Among these, only 1 interaction of ABCA1 rs1883025 with PA was statistically significant in men, after Bonferroni correction (P-interaction = 0.001 [α = 0.05/21 = 0.002]). The per-major-allele (C) increase in log-transformed HDL-C was lost in men with low PA (β = 0.008) compared with those with medium (β = 0.032) or high PA (β = 0.034).

However, few reports have focused on the effects of different fatty acid (FA) compositions on the diversity of gut microbiota and its metabolites. Therefore, the aim of this research was to investigate the effects of different dietary fats on liver mRNA expression levels of genes related to cholesterol and bile acid (BA) , as well as to investigate cecal microbiota composition and bacterial metabolites composition in rats. Four-week-old male Wistar/ST rats were fed a 15%  diet for 30 days, including from different sources (soybean oil, lard, menhaden oil, or tuna oil). Then, the rats' cecal microbiota composition was determined by sequencing the 16S ribosomal RNA gene using next-generation sequencing. Lard diet drastically decreased the expression level of liver ATP-binding cassette subfamily G genes (Abcg5 and Abcg8 genes) compared with other diets. Menhaden oil diet increased the fecal BA excretion compared with soybean oil and lard diets. Fecal BA excretion tended to be positively correlated with the relative abundance of Firmicutes, and negatively correlated with the relative abundance of Bacteroidetes. These results have shown that dietary fats with different FA compositions have a different effect on the relative composition of cecal microbiota, and in particular, menhaden oil may have very different effects compared to other experimental fats. The effects of fish oils on the cecal microbiota may differ greatly depending on the ratio of EPA to DHA and the composition of FA other than n-3 polyunsaturated FA.

Farnesoid X receptor (FXR) has recently emerged as an attractive target for obesity treatment. Here we demonstrate that isotschimgine (ITG), a constituent in genus Ferula, as a novel FXR agonist with anti-obesity and anti-hepatic steatosis effects. The results showed that ITG activated the FXR transactivity and bound with the ligand binding dormain (LBD) of FXR with gene reporter assays and AlphaScreen assays. In high- diet-induced obese (DIO) mice, ITG lowered body weight and  mass, improved insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis. Mechanistic studies showed that ITG altered the expression levels of FXR downstream genes,  synthesis and energy  genes in the liver of mice.

The prototypical ligand of the AHR is an environmental contaminant called 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD). TCDD exposure is associated with many adverse health outcomes in humans including non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Previous studies suggest that AHR ligands alter cholesterol homeostasis in mice through repression of genes involved in cholesterol biosynthesis, such as Hmgcr, which encodes the rate-limiting enzyme of cholesterol biosynthesis called 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR). In this study, we sought to characterize the impact of HMGCR repression in TCDD-induced liver injury. C57BL/6 mice were exposed to TCDD in the presence or absence of simvastatin, a competitive inhibitor of HMGCR. Simvastatin exposure decreased TCDD-induced hepatic  accumulation in both sexes, but was most prominent in females. Simvastatin and TCDD (S + T) co-treatment increased hepatic AHR-battery gene expression and liver injury in male, but not female, mice. In addition, the S + T co-treatment led to an increase in hepatic glycogen content that coincides with heavier liver in female mice. Results from this study suggest that statins, which are amongst the most prescribed pharmaceuticals, may protect from AHR-mediated steatosis, but alter glycogen  and increase the risk of TCDD-elicited liver damage in a sex-specific manner.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31689010>Plasma High-Resolution Metabolomics Differentiates Adults with Normal Weight Obesity from Lean Individuals.</a></h1><p>This study explored underlying -related dysfunction by examining metabolomic profiles in adults categorized as lean, as having normal weight obesity (NWO), or as having overweight/obesity.Participants (N = 179) had fasting plasma analyzed by liquid chromatography and high-resolution mass spectrometry for high-resolution metabolomics.

Peripheral quantitative computed tomography measured marrow density of the 4% distal tibia (surrogate for marrow ) by threshold-based, edge-detection segmentations and by examining residuals from trabecular bone density regressed on trabecular tissue mineral density. Muscle adiposity from MRI was regressed on marrow density using linear regression. Models were further examined with an interaction with osteoporosis status. Among 312 women (age: 75.4±5.9yrs, BMI: 29.5±5.7kg/m ), a larger amount of muscle  was associated with lower marrow density at the 66% mid-tibia (B: 84.08(27.56), p=0.002) and at the 4% distal tibia (B: 129.17(55.96), p=0.022) after accounting for age, height, weight, average daily energy expenditure, hypertension and diabetes. Interactions of this relationship with osteoporosis status were also significant. Upon probing these interactions, the relationships were significant only in women with osteoporosis, but not in those without osteoporosis.  from bone marrow and muscle may be related to one another through the same phenomenon, which is likely also responsible for osteoporosis, but independent of hypertension and diabetes. More research should focus on the potential abnormalities in muscle and bone  and mesenchymal cell commitment to  within patients with osteoporosis. This article is protected by copyright.

Although Rg1 has been proved to have an antiobesity effect, the mechanism of this effect and whether it involves adipose browning have not been elucidated.3T3-L1 and subcutaneous white adipocytes from mice were used to access the thermogenic effect of Rg1. Adipose mitochondria and uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) expression were analyzed by immunofluorescence. Protein level and mRNA of UCP1 were also evaluated by Western blotting and real-time polymerase chain reaction, respectively.Rg1 dramatically enhanced expression of brown adipocyte-specific markers, such as UCP1 and fatty acid oxidation genes, including carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1. In addition, it modulated , activated 5' adenosine monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase, and promoted  droplet dispersion.Rg1 increases UCP1 expression and mitochondrial biogenesis in 3T3-L1 and subcutaneous white adipose cells isolated from C57BL/6 mice. We suggest that Rg1 exerts its antiobesity effects by promoting adipocyte browning through activation of the AMP-activated protein kinase pathway.© 2018 The Korean Society of Ginseng, Published by Elsevier Korea LLC.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31690622>Functional Diversification of the Chemical Landscapes of Yeast Sec14-like Phosphatidylinositol Transfer Protein -Binding Cavities.</a></h1><p>Phosphatidylinositol-transfer proteins (PITPs) are key regulators of  signaling in eukaryotic cells. These proteins both potentiate the activities of phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) 4-OH kinases and help channel production of specific pools of PtdIns-4-phosphate (PtdIns4P) dedicated to specific biological outcomes. In this manner, PITPs represent a major contributor to the mechanisms by which the biological outcomes of phosphoinositide are diversified. The two-ligand priming model proposes that the engine by which Sec14-like PITPs potentiate PtdIns kinase activities is a heterotypic  exchange cycle where PtdIns is a common exchange substrate among the Sec14-like PITP family, but the second exchange ligand varies with the PITP. A major prediction of this model is that second-exchangeable ligand identity will vary from PITP to PITP. Thus, we used structural, computational and biochemical approaches to probe the diversities of the -binding cavity microenvironments of the yeast Sec14-like PITPs. Using Sfh2 and Sfh3 as models, we demonstrate these represent PtdIns/squalene and PtdIns/ergosterol exchange proteins, respectively. The collective data report that yeast Sec14-like PITP -binding pockets indeed define diverse chemical microenvironments that translate into differential ligand binding specificities across this protein family.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31679731>Vitamin D deficiency and its treatment in cystic fibrosis.</a></h1><p>Vitamin D deficiency is a common finding in individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF), despite routine supplementation. Hypovitaminosis D is often the result of  malabsorption, but other contributors include increased latitude, poor nutritional intake, decreased sun exposure, impaired hydroxylation of vitamin D, and non-adherence to the prescribed vitamin D regimen. Vitamin D is critical for calcium homeostasis and optimal skeletal health, and vitamin D deficiency in CF can lead to skeletal complications of osteopenia and osteoporosis. Over time, our understanding of treatment regimens for vitamin D deficiency in CF has evolved, leading to recommendations for higher doses of vitamin D to achieve target levels of circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D. There is also some evidence that vitamin D deficiency may have non-skeletal consequences such as an increase in pulmonary exacerbations. The exact mechanisms involved in the non-skeletal complications of vitamin D deficiency are not clearly understood, but may involve the innate immune system. Future clinical studies are needed to help address whether vitamin D has a role in CF beyond skeletal health.Copyright © 2019 European Cystic Fibrosis Society.

However, our poor understanding of the mechanisms that govern the differentiation and activation of brown adipocytes limits the development of such therapy. Various genetic factors controlling the differentiation of brown adipocytes have been identified, although most studies have been performed using in vitro cultured pre-adipocytes. We investigate here the differentiation of brown adipocytes from adipose progenitors in the mouse embryo. We demonstrate that the formation of multiple  droplets (LDs) is initiated within clusters of glycogen, which is degraded through glycophagy to provide the metabolic substrates essential for de novo lipogenesis and LD formation.

However, researches on the impact of isoflurane on insulin-related  in the central nervous system, especially in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), are scarce. This study sought to explore whether isoflurane anesthesia had a negative effect on insulin sensitivity both in peripheral and central tissues. Moreover, the possible role of isoflurane anesthesia in T2DM mice with pre-existing IR was analyzed. T2DM model in C57BL/6J mice was established by high  diet (HFD) and single intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (STZ, 60 mg/kg). Both HFD/STZ-induced T2DM mice and normal mice received 6 h isoflurane exposure. Blood glucose level and serum insulin concentration were detected and the homeostasis model assessment of IR (HOMA-IR) index was calculated to estimate peripheral IR. Relative levels of genes and proteins in the insulin-dependent signaling pathway in mouse prefrontal cortex and hippocampus were determined to measure central IR. Results indicated that 6 h isoflurane exposure induced hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia and raised HOMA-IR index. Meanwhile, phosphorylated insulin receptor substrate-1 (pIRS1) (Ser639) and phosphorylated insulin receptor substrate-2 (pIRS2) (Ser731) were upregulated, while phosphorylated protein kinase B (pAKT) (Ser473) and phosphorylated glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (pGSK3β) (Ser9) were downregulated in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus of anesthetized mice. Notably, isoflurane anesthesia significantly aggravated the degree of central IR in the aspects of gene transcriptions and protein expressions in HFD/STZ-induced T2DM mice with pre-existing IR. This study suggested that isoflurane anesthesia induced peripheral and central IR and aggravated pre-existing insulin resistance in T2DM mice.Copyright © 2019.

Here, we demonstrated that panx1 deletion protected against renal IRI byregulating ferroptotic cell death. In panx1 knockout mice subjected to renal IRI,decreased plasma creatinine, MDA contents in kidney tissue, and tubular cell death(decreased TUNEL positive renal tubular cells) were found compared to those inpanx1 wild type (wt) mice.

The mechanism of YY1 regulation on peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1β (PGC-1β) and its downstream genes medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD) and long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (LCAD) were investigated using molecular biology and biochemical methods. The role of YY1/ PGC-1β axis in hepatocarcinogenesis was studied using xenograft experiment.  This study showed that YY1 suppresses fatty acid β-oxidation, leading to increase of cellular triglyceride level and  accumulation in HCC cells, and subsequently induction of the tumorigenesis potential of HCC cells. Molecular mechanistic study revealed that YY1 blocks the expression of , an activator of fatty acid β-oxidation, by directly binding to its promoter; and thus downregulates PGC-1β/MCAD and PGC1-β/LCAD axis.

Stearoyl CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1) is a critical lipogenic enzyme that catalyzes the synthesis of two monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA), oleate and palmitoleate, from the saturated fatty acids, stearate and palmitate, respectively. SCD1-deficient mouse models are protected against diet-induced adiposity, hepatic steatosis, and hyperglycemia. However, the mechanism of this protection by SCD1 deficiency is unclear. Using a liver-specific SCD1 knockout (LKO) mouse model fed a high-carbohydrate, low- diet (HCD), we show that hepatic SCD1 deficiency increases systemic glucose uptake. Hepatic SCD1 deficiency enhanced glucose transporter type 1 (GLUT1) expression in the liver and also up-regulated GLUT4 and adiponectin expression in the adipose tissue. The enhanced glucose uptake correlated with increased liver expression and elevated plasma levels of fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21), a hepatokine known to increase systemic insulin sensitivity and to regulate whole-body . Feeding LKO mice with triolein-supplemented, but not tristearin-supplemented, HCD reduced FGF21 expression and plasma levels. Consistently, SCD1 inhibition in primary hepatocytes induced FGF21 expression, which was repressed by treatment with oleate but not palmitoleate. Moreover, deletion of the transcriptional coactivator PPARg coactivator 1α (PGC-1α) reduced hepatic and plasma FGF21 and white adipocyte tissue-specific GLUT4 expression and raised plasma glucose levels in the LKO mice. These results suggest that hepatic oleate regulates glucose uptake in adipose tissue either directly or partially by modulating the hepatic PGC-1α-FGF21 axis.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31690633>TFEB drives PGC-1α expression in adipocytes to protect against diet-induced metabolic dysfunction.</a></h1><p>TFEB is a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor that confers protection against metabolic diseases such as atherosclerosis by targeting a network of genes involved in autophagy-lysosomal biogenesis and  catabolism. In this study, we sought to characterize the role of TFEB in adipocyte and adipose tissue physiology and evaluate the therapeutic potential of adipocyte-specific TFEB overexpression in obesity. We demonstrated that mice with adipocyte-specific TFEB overexpression (Adipo-TFEB) were protected from diet-induced obesity, insulin resistance, and metabolic sequelae. Adipo-TFEB mice were lean primarily through increased metabolic rate, suggesting a role for adipose tissue browning and enhanced nonshivering thermogenesis in . Transcriptional characterization revealed that TFEB targeted genes involved in adipose tissue browning rather than those involved in autophagy. One such gene encoded PGC-1α, an established target of TFEB that promotes adipocyte browning. To dissect the role of PGC-1α in mediating the downstream effects of TFEB overexpression, we generated mice with adipocyte-specific PGC-1α deficiency and TFEB overexpression. Without PGC-1α, the ability of TFEB overexpression to brown adipose tissue and to elicit beneficial metabolic effects was blunted. Overall, these data implicate TFEB as a PGC-1α-dependent regulator of adipocyte browning and suggest its therapeutic potential in treating metabolic disease.Copyright © 2019 The Authors, some rights reserved; exclusive licensee American Association for the Advancement of Science.

Such RNA molecules have gained much attention from biotech and pharmaceutical companies, which led to the first Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved ncRNA therapeutic in 2018. However, the main barrier in clinical practice of ncRNAs is the lack of an effective delivery system that can protect the RNA molecules from nuclease degradation, deliver them to specific tissues and cell types, and release them into the cytoplasm of the targeted cells, all without inducing adverse effects. For that reason, drug delivery approaches, formulations, technologies and systems for transporting pharmacological ncRNA compounds to achieve a diagnostic or therapeutic effect in the human body are in demand. Here, we review the development of therapeutic -based nanoparticles for delivery of miRNAs, one class of endogenous ncRNAs with specific regulatory functions. We outline challenges and opportunities for advanced miRNA-based therapies, and discuss the complexity associated with the delivery of functional miRNAs. Novel strategies are addressed how to deal with the most critical points in miRNA delivery, such as toxicity, specific targeting of disease sites, proper cellular uptake and endosomal escape of miRNAs. Current fields of application and various preclinical settings involving miRNA therapeutics are discussed, providing an outlook to future clinical approaches.

It has been previously observed that lactate production is also an important metabolic feature of adipocytes, but its relationship to adipose and whole-body glucose disposal remains unclear. Therefore, using a combination of metabolic labeling techniques, here we closely examined lactate production of cultured and primary mammalian adipocytes. Insulin treatment increased glucose uptake and conversion to lactate, with the latter responding more to insulin than did other metabolic fates of glucose. However, lactate production did not just serve as a mechanism to dispose of excess glucose, since we also observed that lactate production in adipocytes did not solely depend on glucose availability and even occurred independently of glucose . This suggests that lactate production is prioritized in adipocytes. Furthermore, knocking down lactate dehydrogenase specifically in the  body of Drosophila flies lowered circulating lactate and improved whole-body glucose disposal. These results emphasize lactate production is an additional metabolic role of adipose tissue beyond  storage and release.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693892>Metformin Improves Mitochondrial Respiratory Activity through Activation of AMPK.</a></h1><p>Impaired mitochondrial respiratory activity contributes to the development of insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes. Metformin, a first-line antidiabetic drug, functions mainly by improving patients' hyperglycemia and insulin resistance. However, its mechanism of action is still not well understood. We show here that pharmacological metformin concentration increases mitochondrial respiration, membrane potential, and ATP levels in hepatocytes and a clinically relevant metformin dose increases liver mitochondrial density and complex 1 activity along with improved hyperglycemia in high-- diet (HFD)-fed mice. Metformin, functioning through 5' AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), promotes mitochondrial fission to improve mitochondrial respiration and restore the mitochondrial life cycle. Furthermore, HFD-fed-mice with liver-specific knockout of AMPKα1/2 subunits exhibit higher blood glucose levels when treated with metformin. Our results demonstrate that activation of AMPK by metformin improves mitochondrial respiration and hyperglycemia in obesity. We also found that supra-pharmacological metformin concentrations reduce adenine nucleotides, resulting in the halt of mitochondrial respiration.

Inferences drawn from both the literature (via indirect associations) and public transcriptome data (via correlation) point to the likely participation of ACSL1 and ACSL4, another family member, in inflammasome activation in neutrophils during sepsis. Furthermore, available clinical data indicate that levels of ACSL1 and ACSL4 induction was significantly higher in fatal cases of sepsis. This denotes potential translational relevance and is consistent with involvement in pathways driving potentially deleterious systemic inflammation. Finally, while ACSL1 expression was induced in blood  by a wide range of pathogen-derived factors as well as TNF, induction of ACSL4 appeared restricted to flagellated bacteria and pathogen-derived TLR5 agonists and IFNG. Taken together, this joint review of public literature and omics data records points to two members of the acyl-CoA synthetase family potentially playing a role in inflammasome activation in neutrophils. Translational relevance of these observations in the context of sepsis and other inflammatory conditions remain to be investigated.Copyright © 2019 Roelands, Garand, Hinchcliff, Ma, Shah, Toufiq, Alfaki, Hendrickx, Boughorbel, Rinchai, Jazaeri, Bedognetti and Chaussabel.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692408>Relationship between metabolic syndrome and acylated/desacylated ghrelin ratio in patients with schizophrenia under olanzapine medication.</a></h1><p>Ghrelin is a peptide hormone that mediates glucose homeostasis and . Acylated ghrelin (AG) and desacylated ghrelin (DAG) are the two main forms of ghrelin, which have opposing roles in energy homeostasis. The AG/DAG ratio has been proposed to be associated with metabolic syndrome (MetS) in the general population. This study compared the relationships between MetS and ghrelin parameters in patients with schizophrenia.Patients diagnosed with schizophrenia and under olanzapine monotherapy were recruited. Fasting blood samples were collected for the analyses of metabolic and ghrelin parameters. The serum levels of total ghrelin and AG were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits. DAG level was calculated by subtracting the AG level from the total ghrelin level.We recruited 151 subjects with schizophrenia, and classified them into those with MetS ( = 41) and those without MetS ( = 110). Subjects with MetS had a significantly higher AG/DAG ratio, as well as lower total ghrelin and DAG levels. There were no sex differences in ghrelin parameters. The AG/DAG ratio was significantly and positively correlated with weight, body mass index, waist circumference, insulin level, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance and number of MetS components. Multiple linear regression analysis indicated that the number of MetS components remained significantly associated with the AG/DAG ratio.Our results revealed that lower AG/DAG ratios were associated with better metabolic profiles in olanzapine-treated patients with schizophrenia. These observations suggest that the balance between AG and DAG plays a crucial role in the metabolic homeostasis among patients with schizophrenia.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31676981>Circulating palmitoleic acid is an independent determinant of insulin sensitivity, beta cell function and glucose tolerance in non-diabetic individuals: a longitudinal analysis.</a></h1><p>Experimental studies suggest that the fatty acid palmitoleate may act as an adipocyte-derived  hormone (or 'lipokine') to regulate systemic . We investigated the relationship of circulating palmitoleate with insulin sensitivity, beta cell function and glucose tolerance in humans.Plasma NEFA concentration and composition were determined in non-diabetic individuals from the Relationship between Insulin Sensitivity and Cardiovascular disease (RISC) study cohort at baseline (n = 1234) and after a 3 year follow-up (n = 924). Glucose tolerance, insulin secretion and beta cell function were assessed during an OGTT. Whole-body insulin sensitivity was measured by a hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp (M/I) and OGTT (oral glucose insulin sensitivity index [OGIS]). The liver insulin resistance index was calculated using clinical and biochemical data. Body composition including  mass was determined by bioelectrical impedance.Circulating palmitoleate was proportional to  mass (r = 0.21, p < 0.0001) and total NEFA levels (r = 0.19, p < 0.0001). It correlated with whole-body insulin sensitivity (M/I: standardised regression coefficient [std. β] = 0.16, p < 0.0001), liver insulin resistance (std. β = -0.14, p < 0.0001), beta cell function (potentiation: std. β = 0.08, p = 0.045) and glucose tolerance (2 h glucose: std. β = -0.24, p < 0.0001) after adjustment for age, sex, BMI, adiposity and other NEFA. High palmitoleate concentrations prevented the decrease in insulin sensitivity associated with excess palmitate (p = 0.0001). In a longitudinal analysis, a positive independent relationship was observed between changes in palmitoleate and insulin sensitivity over time (std. β = 0.07, p = 0.04).We demonstrated that plasma palmitoleate is an independent determinant of insulin sensitivity, beta cell function and glucose tolerance in non-diabetic individuals. These results support the role of palmitoleate as a beneficial lipokine released by adipose tissue to prevent the negative effects of adiposity and excess NEFA on systemic glucose .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694509>Modern Perspective on Metabolic Reprogramming in Malignant Neoplasms.</a></h1><p>Metabolic reprogramming is one of the central features of transformed cells.

The purpose of this study is to investigate the programming effects of maternal obesity during preconception and the preconception/gestational period on adiposity and adipose tissue inflammation in offspring using an animal model. Adult female C57Bl/6J mice were assigned either normal diet, high  diet (HFD) prior to pregnancy, or HFD prior to and through pregnancy. Some offspring were maintained on normal diet while others started HFD later in life. Offspring were assessed for body composition and metabolic responses.  storing tissues were evaluated for expansion and inflammation. Male offspring from the preconception group had the greatest weight gain, most subcutaneous adipose tissue, and largest liver mass when introduced to postnatal HFD. Male offspring of the preconception/gestation group had worsened glucose tolerance and an increase in resident (CD11c) adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) when exposed to postnatal HFD. Female offspring had no significant difference in any parameter between the diet treatment groups. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that prenatal and pregnancy windows have independent programming effects on offspring. Preconception exposure affects body composition and adiposity while gestation exposure affects  and tissue immune cell phenotypes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31678212>MicroRNA regulation of CTP synthase and cytoophidium in Drosophila melanogaster.</a></h1><p>CTPsyn is a crucial metabolic enzyme which synthesizes CTP nucleotides. It has the extraordinary ability to compartmentalize into filaments termed cytoophidia. Though the structure is evolutionarily conserved across kingdoms, the mechanisms behind their formation remain unknown. Micro-RNAs (miRNAs) are short single-stranded RNA capable of directing mRNA silencing and degradation. D. melanogaster has a high total gene count to miRNA gene number ratio, alluding to the possibility that CTPsyn too may come under their regulation. A thorough miRNA overexpression involving 123 miRNAs was conducted, followed by CTPsyn-specific staining upon cytoophidia-rich egg chambers. This revealed a small group of candidates which confer either a lengthening or truncating effect on cytoophidia, suggesting they may play a role in regulating CTPsyn. MiR-975 and miR-1014 are both cytoophidia-elongating, whereas miR-190 and miR-932 are cytoophidia-shortening. Though target prediction shows that miR-975 and miR-932 do indeed have binding sites on CTPsyn mRNA, in vitro assays instead revealed a low probability of this being true, instead indicating that the effects asserted by overexpressed miRNAs indirectly reach CTPsyn and its cytoophidia through the actions of middling elements. In silico target prediction and qPCR quantification indicated that, at least for miR-932 and miR-1014, these undetermined elements may be players in . This is the first study to thoroughly investigate miRNAs in connection to CTPsyn expression and activity in any species. The findings presented could serve as a basis for further queries into not only the fundamental aspects of the enzyme's regulation, but may uncover new facets of closely related pathways as well.Copyright © 2019.

IGFs take part in the embryonal development and postnatal growth, in interaction with the growth hormone (GH). The physiological effects of IGF1 are promotion of tissue growth and development, stimulation of cell proliferation, effects on  and carbohydrate , anti-aging, anti-inflammatory, anabolic, anti-oxidant, neuro- and hepatoprotective properties. Our knowledge about the GH/IGF axis is diverse, partly contradictory, their research is continued intensively nowadays. We considered it worthwhile to review and interpret this information. Study on GH/IGF medical reports, with particular reference to the less known metabolic control. 75% of the growth factors are produced in the liver by GH and insulin stimulation; their effects are expressed on specific receptors, and modified by specific binding proteins. IGF1 directly increases the muscle mass, bone density, and the structure of the bones. Intestinal microbiota induces secretion of IGF1, which promotes the development and remodeling of the bones. Short-chain fatty acids, produced in microbial fermented fibers, induce secretion of IGF1, suggesting that microbial activity also affects bone health  IGF1. IGF1 also has a direct and indirect glucose-lowering effect, enhances free fatty acid oxidation in the muscle, reducing the flow of free fatty acid into the liver, improving insulin signaling, resulting in the reduction of hepatic glucose output, and improves insulin sensitivity. IGF1 directly influences the expression of circadian BMAL1 in hypothalamic cells: this refers to the newly recognized 'zeitgeber' role of IGF1. The bioactivity of insulin-like peptides in the brain is characterized by neuronal survival, excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission, maintenance of normal free fatty acid levels, improvement of cognitive function, protection against cell damage, neurogenesis and angiogenesis. The effects of IGF2 are less outlined, however, it has a relevant role in the development of the fetus, and acts protectively on the brain. Lack or over-expression of IGF1 can be detected or may causally associated in many pathological conditions. According to these collected data, insulin sensitivity may be improved by different pathways. The role of IGFs in these processes should be a task of future research.

Here we identified acetoacetate as an endogenous agonist for short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) receptor GPR43 by ligand screening in a heterologous expression system. Under ketogenic conditions, such as starvation and low-carbohydrate diets, plasma acetoacetate levels increased markedly, whereas plasma and cecal SCFA levels decreased dramatically, along with an altered gut microbiota composition. In addition, -deficient mice showed reduced weight loss and suppressed plasma lipoprotein lipase activity during fasting and eucaloric ketogenic diet feeding. Moreover, -deficient mice exhibited minimal weight decrease after intermittent fasting.

The PD animals were further sub-divided into five groups ( = 6) where they were treated with BA for 12 weeks while monitoring changes in blood glucose, caloric intake, and body weight. Diet-induced prediabetes resulted in increased body weight, caloric intake, glycated haemoglobin, and glucose tolerance.

Recently, energy  in adipose tissue has been the subject of renewed interest, because significant energy expenditure can be induced in cells derived from white adipose tissue progenitors, in addition to brown adipose tissue (BAT). Here we evaluated whether aging-associated change in various adipose tissue depots affects the progression of NAFLD.Six-week-old male C57BL/6NCrSlc mice were fed control chow (C) or high- diet (60% ; HF) for 12 or 24 weeks (12w/C, 12w/HF, 24w/C and 24w/HF groups, respectively) or switched from C to HF diet at 18 weeks of age (24w/C/HF group) and fed for a further 24 weeks. Some 24w/HF mice received a subcutaneous transplantation of adipose progenitors (10 cells/mouse) from young donor mice. Basal energy expenditure, glucose tolerance, and liver and adipose tissue histology were then evaluated. In addition, features of senescence and the capacity of adipose progenitors to "brown" were compared in mice of various ages.12w/HF mice demonstrated compensation in the forms of hypertrophy of interscapular classical BAT and the appearance of subcutaneous beige adipocytes, consistent with improved metabolic homeostasis. In contrast, 24w/HF and 24w/C/HF mice developed obesity, glucose intolerance, and severe NAFLD, with accelerated senescence and loss of adipose progenitors in subcutaneous  tissues. Recruitment of adipose progenitors ameliorated these findings in 24w/HF mice.Impaired metabolic compensation in adipose tissue resulted in the progression of NAFLD, which was associated with aging-related deterioration in adipose progenitors. A new approach targeting adipose tissue progenitors might represent a potential strategy for the prevention of NAFLD.© 2019 Taketani et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31689374>PRADC1: a novel metabolic-responsive secretory protein that modulates physical activity and adiposity.</a></h1><p>Interorgan communication mediated by secreted proteins plays a pivotal role in metabolic homeostasis, yet the function of many circulating secretory proteins remains unknown. Here, we describe the function of protease-associated domain-containing 1 (PRADC1), an enigmatic secretory protein widely expressed in humans and mice. In metabolically active tissues (liver, muscle, , heart, and kidney), we showed that  expression is significantly suppressed by refeeding and reduced in kidney and brown  in the context of obesity. PRADC1 is dispensable for whole-body  when mice are fed a low- diet. However, in obesity induced by high- feeding, PRADC1-deficient female mice have reduced weight gain and adiposity despite similar caloric intake. Decreased  mass is attributed, in part, to increased metabolic rate, physical activity, and energy expenditure in these animals. Reduced adiposity in PRADC1-deficient mice, however, does not improve systemic glucose and , insulin sensitivity, liver steatosis, or adipose inflammation. Thus, in PRADC1-deficient animals, decreased  mass and enhanced physical activity are insufficient to confer a healthy metabolic phenotype in the context of an obesogenic diet.

However, the observed association was influenced by the consumption of alcohol. Furthermore, it is unknown whether impaired glucose  exists in people with extremely high HDL-C, regardless of their alcohol consumption. Therefore, we addressed this issue in people who did not have a habit of drinking alcohol.In this community-based cross-sectional study, we included 177,034 participants (40-74 years old) who reported being nondrinkers. We investigated levels of HbA, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), HDL-C, and clinical parameters according to 11 levels of HDL-C concentration from 20 to 120 mg/dL or over.A total of 6112 participants with HDL-C ≥ 100 mg/dL (3.5%) showed a better  profile, higher prevalence amongst women, more habitual exercise, a lower prevalence of smoking, and lower body mass index (BMI). Compared with an HDL-C of 70-79 mg/dL, HDL-C ≤ 69 mg/dL (except an HDL-C of 20-29 mg/dL) and HDL-C ≥ 90 mg/dL were significantly associated with a high HbA of ≥6.0%, independently of confounding factors.

Low carnitine availability may contribute to metabolic inflexibility and impaired glucose tolerance. Here, we investigated whether carnitine supplementation improves metabolic flexibility and insulin sensitivity in impaired glucose tolerant (IGT) volunteers.Eleven IGT- volunteers followed a 36-day placebo- and L-carnitine treatment (2 g/day) in a randomised, placebo-controlled, double blind crossover design. A hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp (40 mU/m/min), combined with indirect calorimetry (ventilated hood) was performed to determine insulin sensitivity and metabolic flexibility. Furthermore, metabolic flexibility was assessed in response to a high-energy meal. Skeletal muscle acetylcarnitine concentrations were measured in vivo using long echo time proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (H-MRS, TE=500 ms) in the resting state (7:00AM and 5:00PM) and after a 30-min cycling exercise. Twelve normal glucose tolerant (NGT) volunteers were included without any intervention as control group.Metabolic flexibility of IGT-subjects completely restored towards NGT control values upon carnitine supplementation, measured during a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp and meal test. In muscle, carnitine supplementation enhanced the increase in resting acetylcarnitine concentrations over the day (delta 7:00 AM versus 5:00 PM) in IGT-subjects. Furthermore, carnitine supplementation increased post-exercise acetylcarnitine concentrations and reduced long-chain acylcarnitine species in IGT-subjects, suggesting the stimulation of a more complete  oxidation in muscle. Whole-body insulin sensitivity was not affected.Carnitine supplementation improves acetylcarnitine formation and rescues metabolic flexibility in IGT-subjects.

Reaction mixtures without the extract served as negative control, while tissues without the extract or standard antioxidant (gallic acid) and pro-oxidant served as the normal control. The tissues were analyzed for levels of glutathione, malondialdehyde, and nitric oxide as well as cholinergic, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), lipase, and purinergic enzymes activities,  profiles, fatty acid metabolic pathways and metabolites.Induction of oxidative damage significantly (p < 0.05) depleted the levels of GSH, SOD, catalase, and ENTPDase activities, while concomitantly elevating the levels of MDA, NO, ACE, acetylcholinesterase, lipase and ATPase activities. These levels and activities were significantly reversed on treatment with B. saligna. Treatment with B. saligna also led to depletion of cardiac cholesterol and LDL-c levels, while elevating triglyceride and HDL-c level. It also depleted oxidative-induced  metabolites with concomitant generation of thirteen other metabolites.

Glucose transporter type 2 (GLUT2) and sodium-coupled glucose cotransporters 2 (SGLT2) in the proximal tubules play a critical role in the reabsorption of glucose and have been linked to the occurrence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Our study was designed to investigate the role of GLUT2 and SGLT2 in the pathogenesis of GDM, which is considered a forerunner of T2DM, and investigate the related molecular mechanism.High- diet (HFD) was utilized to build a GDM mouse model that closely induces metabolic abnormalities similar to human GDM. Body weight, blood glucose and serum insulin were recorded in the experimental process. Glucose tolerance was determined by the use of an intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test (IPGTT). In addition, levels of GLUT2 and SGLT2 were evaluated to further explore the underlying mechanism of GDM.HFD feeding induced abnormal glucose  as manifested by increased levels of blood glucose and insulin and prominent glucose intolerance. Additionally, fetal mice from mother feed on HFD showed higher mean body weight. Furthermore, HFD feeding led to an increase in the number of positive cells of GLUT2 and SGLT2 in the renal proximal tubule and the expressions of renal GLUT2 and SGLT2 mRNA and proteins in mice.

Progression of peritoneal metastasis, as with other advanced malignancies, is associated with cancer cachexia anorexia syndrome (CAS), involving poor appetite (anorexia), involuntary weight loss, and chronic inflammation. Eventual causes of mortality include dysfunctional  and energy store exhaustion. Etiology of CAS in PM patients is multifactorial including tumor growth, host response, cytokine release, systemic inflammation, proteolysis, lipolysis, malignant small bowel obstruction, ascites, and gastrointestinal side effects of drug therapy (chemotherapy, opioids). Metabolic changes of CAS in PM relate more to a systemic inflammatory response than an adaptation to starvation. Metabolic reprogramming is required for cancer cells shed into the peritoneal cavity to resist anoikis (i.e., programmed cell death). Profound changes in hexokinase  are needed to compensate ineffective oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria. During the development of PM, hypoxia inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) plays a key role in activating both aerobic and anaerobic glycolysis, increasing the uptake of glucose, , and glutamine into cancer cells. HIF-1α upregulates hexokinase II, phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (PGK1), pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase (PDK), pyruvate kinase muscle isoenzyme 2 (PKM2), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and glucose transporters (GLUT) and promotes cytoplasmic glycolysis. HIF-1α also stimulates the utilization of glutamine and fatty acids as alternative energy substrates. Cancer cells in the peritoneal cavity interact with cancer-associated fibroblasts and adipocytes to meet metabolic demands and incorporate autophagy products for growth. Therapy of CAS in PM is challenging. Optimal nutritional intake alone including total parenteral nutrition is unable to reverse CAS. Pressurized intraperitoneal aerosol chemotherapy (PIPAC) stabilized nutritional status in a significant proportion of PM patients. Agents targeting the mechanisms of CAS are under development.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31689973>Effects of  Supplementation in Dairy Goats on  and Health Status.</a></h1><p> supplementation has long been used in dairy ruminant nutrition to increase the  content of milk and supply energy during particularly challenging production phases. Throughout the years, advances have been made in the knowledge of metabolic pathways and technological treatments of dietary fatty acids (FAs), resulting in safer and more widely available  supplements. There is an awareness of the positive nutraceutical effects of the addition of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) to  supplementation, which provides consumers with healthier animal products through manipulation of their characteristics. If it is true that benefits to human health can be derived from the consumption of animal products rich in bioactive fatty acids (FAs), then it is reasonable to think that the same effect can occur in the animals to which the supplements are administered. Therefore, recent advances in  supplementation of dairy goats with reference to the effect on health status have been summarized. In vivo trials and in vitro analysis on cultured cells, as well as histological and transcriptomic analyses of hepatic and adipose tissue, have been reviewed in order to assess documented relationships between specific FAs, , and immunity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31675538>PPARG and FTO polymorphism can modulate the outcomes of a central European diet and a Mediterranean diet in centrally obese postmenopausal women.</a></h1><p>The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that polymorphism of genes with the biggest effects on body mass (FTO and PPARG) can affect the results of dieting in centrally obese postmenopausal women. A total of 144 volunteers were randomized to a 16-week intervention with two hypocaloric diets: either a Mediterranean diet (MED) moderate in  (37% total energy as ) or the Central European diet (CED) moderate in carbohydrates (55% total energy as carbohydrates). The associations between FTO and PPARG polymorphism on the baseline body mass, body composition, blood pressure,  and non- parameters, and their changes after the trial were analyzed. None of the examined baseline outcomes differed in the rs9939609 FTO subgroups; abdominal  was higher in the minor (G) allele carriers of the PPARG rs1801282. After the intervention, in the CED group, the PPARG G allele carriers showed greater reductions in weight (-6.58 ± 0.61 vs -9.58 ± 0.83; P < .01), lean mass (-0.38 ± 0.29 vs -1.79 ± 0.38; P < .05) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (-0.46 ± 0.77 vs -5.25 ± 1.49; P < .01) than the CC homozygotes, and the TT individuals of the rs9939609 FTO had greater reductions in diastolic blood pressure (-9.03 ± 1.78 vs. -7.58 ± 1.50; P < .05). In the MED group, greater reductions in abdominal  were observed in the G allele carriers than in the CC homozygotes (-3.31 ± 0.26 vs. -4.23 ± 0.41; P < .05). PPARG and FTO polymorphism may affect the outcomes of the diets aimed at weight reduction in postmenopausal women.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Thymol acts via its potential to enhance productive and reproductive performance, and by improving bioavailability of nutrients in fish. Nevertheless, the exact mechanisms associated with these phenomena remain poorly understood, although recent evidence has suggested the involvement of the phosphotransfer network and antioxidant status. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine whether the improvement of the antioxidant/oxidant status and the phosphoryl transfer network may be involved in enhanced growth performance in grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idella) fed with various levels of thymol (100, 200, and 300 mg/kg feed). Thymol-supplementation (100 mg/kg feed) produced higher body weight and weight gain for 60-day post-feeding compared to the control group. Specific growth rate was higher; while feed conversion ratio was lower in fish that consumed 100 mg of thymol/kg compared to other groups. Hepatic lactate dehydrogenase activity and  peroxidation levels were lower in the thymol-supplemented group (100 mg/kg feed) than in the control group, while reactive oxygen species were lower in all supplemented groups than in the control group. Hepatic superoxide dismutase (300 mg/kg feed) and glutathione peroxidase (100, 200, and 300 mg/kg feed) activities, as well as antioxidant capacity against peroxyl radicals (100 mg/kg feed) were higher in these groups than in the control group. Based on these data, we conclude that 100 mg thymol/kg dietary supplementation increased growth performance of fingerling grass carp. Finally, hepatic adenylate kinase activity was lower in the thymol supplemented group (100 mg/kg feed) than in the control group. Thymol supplementation (100 mg/kg feed) improved hepatic energy , while practically all tested concentrations of thymol enhanced hepatic antioxidant status, all of which may be pathways involved in increased growth performance in fingerling grass carp.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31683443>Obesogen effect of bisphenol S alters mRNA expression and DNA methylation profiling in male mouse liver.</a></h1><p>Environmental pollution is increasingly considered an important factor involved in the obesity incidence. Endocrine disruptors (EDs) are important actors in the concept of DOHaD (Developmental Origins of Health and Disease), where epigenetic mechanisms play crucial roles. Bisphenol A (BPA), a monomer used in the manufacture of plastics and resins is one of the most studied obesogenic endocrine disruptor. Bisphenol S (BPS), a BPA substitute, has the same obesogenic properties, acting at low doses with a sex-specific effect following perinatal exposure. Since the liver is a major organ in regulating body  homeostasis, we investigated gene expression and DNA methylation under low-dose BPS exposure. The BPS obesogenic effect was associated with an increase of hepatic triglyceride content. These physiological disturbances were accompanied by genome-wide changes in gene expression (1366 genes significantly modified more than 1.5-fold). Gene ontology analysis revealed alteration of gene cascades involved in protein translation and complement regulation. It was associated with hepatic DNA hypomethylation in autosomes and hypermethylation in sex chromosomes. Although no systematic correlation has been found between gene repression and hypermethylation, several genes related to liver  were either hypermethylated (Acsl4, Gpr40, Cel, Pparδ, Abca6, Ces3a, Sgms2) or hypomethylated (Soga1, Gpihbp1, Nr1d2, Mlxipl, Rps6kb2, Esrrb, Thra, Cidec). In specific cases (Hapln4, ApoA4, Cidec, genes involved in  and liver fibrosis) mRNA upregulation was associated with hypomethylation. In conclusion, we show for the first time wide disruptive physiological effects of low-dose of BPS, which raises the question of its harmlessness as an industrial substitute for BPA.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the mechanism through which RSV improves insulin resistance is not fully understood yet. The aim of this study was to determine the mechanism through which RSV ameliorates insulin resistance in skeletal muscle of high- diet (HFD)-induced mouse model, as well as palmitic acid (PA) treated L6 cells, with a specific focus on the response of RSV on fatty acid oxidation.Male C57BL6/J mice were randomly divided into three groups: normal diet-fed mice (ND), the high- diet-fed mice (HFD), HFD supplemented with RSV (100 mg/kg body weight [BW]/day orally; n = 10). Fasting plasma glucose, insulin, total cholesterol, triglyceride (TG), and free fatty acid levels were determined. The intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test was used to measure blood glucose and area under the curve. The quantitative insulin sensitivity index was calculated to assess insulin resistance. Skeletal muscles were collected for histology study and protein expression measurement. L6 cells were cultured with PA and the glucose concentration in the culture medium, and the intracellular TG levels were tested. RSV, chloroquine, palmitoyltransferase and Ku-55933 were administered to differentiate L6 cells.The HFD fed mice showed increased BW, hyperglycemia, and hyperlipidemia. The expressions of ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM), 5' adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1, cytochrome oxidase subunit IV protein were significantly decreased in the skeletal muscles of HFD fed mice and PA-treated L6 cells. All these effects induced by HFD and PA were reversed by RSV treatment.ATM is a key factor to improve HFD-induced  and insulin resistance in skeletal muscles. The effects of RSV on ameliorating HFD-induced abnormal  and insulin resistance mediated through ATM-AMPK pathway may due to its improvement in fatty acid oxidation efficiency and sequential reduction in ROS production in skeletal muscle. These results provide important theoretical evidence for the application of RSV in the prevention and treatment of diabetes mellitus and related metabolic diseases.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31683654>Metabolomic Analysis of Influenza A Virus A/WSN/1933 (H1N1) Infected A549 Cells during First Cycle of Viral Replication.</a></h1><p>Influenza A virus (IAV) has developed strategies to utilize host metabolites which, after identification and isolation, can be used to discover the value of immunometabolism. During this study, to mimic the metabolic processes of influenza virus infection in human cells, we infect A549 cells with H1N1 (WSN) influenza virus and explore the metabolites with altered levels during the first cycle of influenza virus infection using ultra-high-pressure liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer (UHPLC-Q-TOF MS) technology. We annotate the metabolites using MetaboAnalyst and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analyses, which reveal that IAV regulates the abundance of the metabolic products of host cells during early infection to provide the energy and metabolites required to efficiently complete its own life cycle. These metabolites are correlated with the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and mainly are involved in purine, , and glutathione metabolisms. Concurrently, the metabolites interact with signal receptors in A549 cells to participate in cellular energy  signaling pathways. Metabonomic analyses have revealed that, in the first cycle, the virus not only hijacks cell  for its own replication, but also affects innate immunity, indicating a need for further study of the complex relationship between IAV and host cells.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31682760>Predictive Metabolomic Signatures for Safety Assessment of Metal Oxide Nanoparticles.</a></h1><p>The widespread use of metal oxide nanoparticles (MOx NPs) poses a risk of exposure that may lead to adverse health effects on humans. Even though a number of toxicological methodologies are available for assessing nanotoxicity, the effect of MOx NPs on cell  in vitro and in vivo remains largely unknown, especially under the exposure to low-dose or supposedly low-toxicity MOx NPs. In this study, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) based metabolomics was used to reveal significantly altered metabolites and metabolic pathways in human bronchial epithelial cells exposed to four different types of MOx NPs (ZnO, SiO2, TiO2 and CeO2) at both high (25 µg/mL) and low (12.5 µg/mL) doses. We demonstrated that high-dose ZnO NPs caused severe cytotoxicity with altered  of amino acids, nucleotides, nucleosides, tricarboxylic acid cycle, lipids, inflammation/redox, and fatty acid oxidation, as well as the elevation of toxic and DNA damage related metabolites. Fewer metabolomic alterations were induced by low dose ZnO NPs. However, most metabolites significantly altered by high dose ZnO NPs were also slightly changed by low dose ZnO NPs. On the other hand, the cells exposed to SiO2, TiO2 and CeO2 NPs at either high or low dose displayed low cytotoxicity with similar metabolomic alterations, although each type of NPs induced distinct changes of certain metabolites. These three NPs significantly affected the metabolic pathways of sphingosine-1-phosphate, fatty acid oxidation, folate cycle, inflammation/redox, and . In addition, dose-dependent effects were observed for a number of metabolites significantly altered by respective MOx NPs. Representative metabolites of the significantly altered metabolic pathways were successfully validated in vitro using enzymatic assays. More importantly, these representative metabolites were further validated in a mouse model after lung exposure to respective NPs, indicating that in vitro metabolomic findings may be used to effectively predict the toxicological effects in vivo. Despite functional assay results demonstrated that the changes in cellular functions were largely reflected by the metabolomic alterations, LC-MS based metabolomics was sensitive enough to detect the subtle metabolomic changes when functional cellular assays showed no significant difference. Collectively, our studies have unveiled potential metabolic mechanisms of MOx NPs-induced nanotoxicity in lung epithelial cells and demonstrated the sensitivity and feasibility of using metabolomic signatures to understand and predict nanotoxicity in vivo.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31679277>Nrf2/HO-1 Mediated Protective Activity of Genistein Against Doxorubicin-Induced Cardiac Toxicity.</a></h1><p>The current study evaluated the cardioprotective activity of genistein in cases of doxorubicin-(Dox) induced cardiac toxicity and a probable mechanism underlying this protection, such as an antioxidant pathway in cardiac tissues. Animals used in this study were categorized into four groups. The first group was treated with sodium carboxymethylcellulose (0.3%; CMC-Na) solution. The second group received Dox (3.0 mg/kg, i.p.) on days 6, 12, 18, and 24. The third and fourth groups received Dox (3 mg/kg, i.p.) on days 6, 12, 18, and 24 and received protective doses of genistein (100 [group 3] and 200 [group 4] mg/kg/day, p.o.) for 30 days. Treatment with genistein significantly improved the altered cardiac function markers and oxidative stress markers. This was coupled with significant improvement in cardiac histopathological features. Genistein enhanced the Nrf2 and HO-1 expression, which showed protection against oxidative insult induced by Dox. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling assay showed substantial inhibition of apoptosis by genistein in myocardia. The study showed that genistein has a strong reactive oxygen species scavenging property and potentially (P ≤ .001) decreases the  peroxidation as well as inhibits DNA damage in cardiac toxicity induced by Dox. In conclusion, the potential antioxidant effect of genistein may be because of its modulatory effect on Nrf2/HO-1 signalling pathway and by this means exhibits cardioprotective effects from Dox-induced oxidative injury.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673028>Microplastics induce transcriptional changes, immune response and behavioral alterations in adult zebrafish.</a></h1><p>Microplastics have become pervasive environmental pollutants in both freshwater and marine ecosystems. The presence of microplastics have been recorded in the tissues of many wild fish species, and laboratory studies have demonstrated that microplastics can exert adverse health effects. To further investigate the biological mechanisms underlying microplastics toxicity we applied an integrated approach, analyzing the effects of microplastics at transcriptomic, histological and behavioral level. Adult zebrafish have been exposed to two concentrations of high-density polyethylene and polystyrene microplastics for twenty days. Transcriptomic results indicate alterations in the expression of immune system genes and the down-regulation of genes correlated with epithelium integrity and . The transcriptomic findings are supported by tissue alterations and higher occurrence of neutrophils observed in gills and intestinal epithelium. Even the daily rhythm of activity of zebrafish appears to be affected, although the regular pattern of activity is recovered over time. Considering the transcriptomic and histological findings reported, we hypothesize that the effects on mucosal epithelium integrity and immune response could potentially reduce the organism defense against pathogens, and lead to a different utilization of energy stores.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673766>Thermal energetics and behaviour of a small, insectivorous marsupial in response to the interacting risks of starvation and predation.</a></h1><p>Central to understanding animal ecology is how prey cope with the interacting risks of starvation and predation. This trade-off is modulated by the energy requirements of prey, yet relatively few studies have incorporated physiological mechanisms for energy savings when considering the behavioural response of prey to predation risk. In our study, we aimed to determine individual variation in behaviour, resting , body temperature and response to 24-h starvation within a captive population of -tailed dunnarts (Sminthopsis crassicaudata; 15-g insectivorous marsupials), and then, using semi-outdoor enclosures, test whether foraging effort and thermal energetics are adjusted in response to manipulation of ground cover, which for small mammals can simulate predation risk. We found that, under the low cover (high predation risk) treatment, dunnarts consumed less food and employed a greater daily reduction in body temperature between their active and rest phase. This result supports the hypothesis that rest-phase thermoregulatory energy savings are employed, even when food is available, if predation risk is perceived to increase the cost of foraging. Individuals exhibited correlated variation along two orthogonal axes incorporating the measured behavioural and metabolic variables, but these differences were not correlated with responses to starvation and predation risk. Our experiment demonstrates that flexibility in daily energy requirements provided by heterothermy can have important consequences for how small mammals respond to both starvation and predation risks. Such challenges are amplified in degraded habitat with introduced predators, making the capacity for heterothermy an even more important mechanism for survival.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31680003>Potentiation of Kras peptide cancer vaccine by avasimibe, a cholesterol modulator.</a></h1><p>No effective approaches to target mutant Kras have yet been developed. Immunoprevention using KRAS-specific antigenic peptides to trigger T cells capable of targeting tumor cells relies heavily on . To facilitate better TCR/peptide/MHC interactions that result in better cancer preventive efficacy, we combined KVax with avasimibe, a specific ACAT1 inhibitor, tested their anti-cancer efficacy in mouse lung cancer models, where Kras mutation was induced before vaccination.Control of tumor growth utilizing a multi-peptide Kras vaccine was tested in combination with avasimibe in a syngeneic lung cancer mouse model and a genetically engineered mouse model (GEMM). Activation of immune responses after administration of Kras vaccine and avasimibe was also assessed by flow cytometry, ELISpot and IHC.We found that Kras vaccine combined with avasimibe significantly decreased the presence of regulatory T cells in the tumor microenvironment and facilitated CD8+ T cell infiltration in tumor sites. Avasimibe also enhanced the efficacy of Kras vaccines target mutant Kras. Whereas the Kras vaccine significantly increased antigen-specific intracellular IFN-γ and granzyme B levels in CD8+ T cells, avasimibe significantly increased the number of tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells. Additionally, modulation of cholesterol  was found to specifically impact in T cells, and not in cancer cells.Avasimibe complements the efficacy of a multi-peptide Kras vaccine in controlling lung cancer development and growth. This treatment regimen represents a novel immunoprevention approach to prevent lung cancer.Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.

In this study, we used hydrogen peroxide (HO)-induced injury in human hepatic L02 cells to investigate the mechanisms involved in the hepatoprotective activity of γ-oryzanol. The injuries produced by HO in L02 cells include increased levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), decreased activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT), loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), increased protein expressions of caspase-9 and caspase-3, and induced apoptosis. Pretreatment with γ-oryzanol enhanced the ROS scavenging activity of endogenous antioxidant enzymes and decreased  peroxidation in HO treated cells. Moreover, pretreatment with γ-oryzanol inhibited HO-induced apoptosis by restoring MMP, upregulating the expression ratio of Bcl-2/Bax, and inhibiting the activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3. These findings show that γ-oryzanol can prevent HO-induced apoptosis by suppressing intracellular accumulation of ROS and impeding ROS-activated mitochondrial apoptotic pathway.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Here we show that the i-AAA protease YME1L rewires the proteome of pre-existing mitochondria in response to hypoxia or nutrient starvation. Inhibition of mTORC1 induces a  signalling cascade via the phosphatidic acid phosphatase LIPIN1, which decreases phosphatidylethanolamine levels in mitochondrial membranes and promotes proteolysis. YME1L degrades mitochondrial protein translocases,  transfer proteins and metabolic enzymes to acutely limit mitochondrial biogenesis and support cell growth. YME1L-mediated mitochondrial reshaping supports the growth of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cells as spheroids or xenografts. Similar changes to the mitochondrial proteome occur in the tumour tissues of patients with PDAC, suggesting that YME1L is relevant to the pathophysiology of these tumours. Our results identify the mTORC1-LIPIN1-YME1L axis as a post-translational regulator of mitochondrial proteostasis at the interface between  and mitochondrial dynamics.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31689964>Basal Metabolic Rate and Body Composition Predict Habitual Food and Macronutrient Intakes: Gender Differences.</a></h1><p>The underlying mechanisms that regulate energy homeostasis and food intake are not fully understood. Moreover, little research has been performed on the relation of body composition with habitual macronutrient intake among free-living populations. Since body composition and energy  differ between males and females, we aimed to determine whether the relationship between body composition and habitual macronutrient intakes is gender-dependent. In this cross-sectional study, 261 participants (99 males) were recruited from Singapore. Macronutrient intake was evaluated from a three-day self-reported dietary record. Body composition and basal metabolic rate (BMR) were determined by using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) and indirect calorimetry, respectively. Our results show that both BMR ( < 0.001) and lean body mass (LBM,  < 0.001) predicted daily energy intake (EI). LBM was positively associated with intakes of protein (PRO) and  () in females, but not in males. This relationship persisted even after adjustment for  mass (FM). On the other hand, no significant associations between FM and macronutrient intake were observed in both males and females. Therefore, the relationship between habitual macronutrient intake, LBM, and BMR is gender-dependent. Elucidating the gender differences in energy  is important for understanding the factors that regulate energy homeostasis and can subsequently help better manage energy balance.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31676768>Hepatic triglyceride accumulation via endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced SREBP-1 activation is regulated by ceramide synthases.</a></h1><p>The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is not only important for protein synthesis and folding but is also crucial for  synthesis and . In the current study, we demonstrate an important role of ceramide synthases (CerS) in ER stress and NAFLD progression. Ceramide is important in sphingolipid , and its acyl chain length is determined by a family of six CerS in mammals. CerS2 generates C22-C24 ceramides, and CerS5 or CerS6 produces C16 ceramide. To gain insight into the role of CerS in NAFLD, we used a high- diet (HFD)-induced NAFLD mouse model. Decreased levels of CerS2 and increased levels of CerS6 were observed in the steatotic livers of mice fed a HFD. In vitro experiments with Hep3B cells indicated the protective role of CerS2 and the detrimental role of CerS6 in the ER stress response induced by palmitate treatment. In particular, CerS6 overexpression increased sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1 (SREBP-1) cleavage with decreased levels of INSIG-1, leading to increased lipogenesis. Blocking ER stress abrogated the detrimental effects of CerS6 on palmitate-induced SREBP-1 cleavage. In accordance with the protective role of CerS2 in the palmitate-induced ER stress response, CerS2 knockdown enhanced ER stress and SREBP-1 cleavage, and CerS2 heterozygote livers exhibited a stronger ER stress response and higher triglyceride levels following HFD. Finally, treatment with a low dose of bortezomib increased hepatic CerS2 expression and protected the development of NAFLD following HFD. These results indicate that CerS and its derivatives impact hepatic ER stress and lipogenesis differently and might be therapeutic targets for NAFLD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693096>The Autophagy-Related Protein GABARAP Is Induced during Overwintering in the Bean Bug (Hemiptera: Alydidae).</a></h1><p>In most insects dependent on food resources that deplete seasonally, mechanisms exist to protect against starvation. Insects overcome periods of food depletion using diapause-associated physiological mechanisms, such as increased energy resources in  bodies and suppression of . Because autophagy supplies energy resources through the degradation of intracellular components, we hypothesized that it might be an additional strategy to combat starvation during overwintering. In this study, we measured the abundance of the proteins involved in the signaling pathway of autophagy during overwintering in adults of the bean bug Riptortus pedestris (Fabricius) (Hemiptera: Alydidae), which must withstand the periodic depletion of its host plants from late fall to early spring. Although the levels of gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor-associated protein (GABARAP) markedly increased after the cessation of food supply, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and target of rapamycin (TOR) were not found to be associated with food depletion. Thus, food depletion appears to induce autophagy independent of AMPK and TOR. The GABARAP levels significantly increased universally when the food supply ceased, irrespective of the diapause status of adults and low-temperature conditions. In overwintering diapause adults under seminatural conditions, the GABARAP levels significantly increased during early spring. Thus, autophagy appears to assist the survival of the bean bugs under natural conditions of food deficiency.© The Author(s) 2019.

CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein beta (C/EBPβ) is a transcription factor, and its inhibition has recently been shown to prevent atherosclerosis development and foam cell formation. However, whether C/EBPβ regulates inflammation, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and apoptosis, in macrophage foam cells and its underlying molecular mechanism remains unknown. Here, we investigated the effect of C/EBPβ knockdown on proteins and genes implicated in inflammation, ER stress, apoptosis, and autophagy in macrophage foam cells. RAW264.7 macrophage cells were transfected with control and C/EBPβ-siRNA and then treated with nLDL and oxLDL. Key proteins and genes involved in inflammation, ER stress, apoptosis, and autophagy were analyzed by western blot and qPCR. We found that short interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of C/EBPβ attenuated atherogenic -mediated induction of proteins and genes implicated in inflammation (P-NFkB-p65, NFkB-p65, and TNFα), ER stress (ATF4 and ATF6), and apoptosis (CHOP, caspase 1, 3, and 12). Interestingly, C/EBPβ knockdown upregulated the expression of autophagy proteins (LC3A/B-II, ATG5) and genes (LC3B, ATG5) but decreased the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) protein phosphorylation and mTORC1 gene expression in oxLDL-loaded RAW264.7 macrophage cells. More importantly, treatment with rapamycin (inhibitor of mTOR) increased expression of proteins implicated in autophagy and cholesterol efflux in oxLDL-loaded RAW 264.7 macrophage cells. The present results suggest that C/EBPβ inactivation regulates macrophage foam cell formation in atherogenesis by reducing inflammation, ER stress, and apoptosis and by promoting autophagy and inactivating mTOR.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31689145>Estradiol regulates daily rhythms underlying diet-induced obesity in female mice.</a></h1><p>The circadian system is a critical regulator of  and obesity in males, but its role in regulating obesity in females is poorly understood. Since there are sex differences in the development of obesity and susceptibility to obesity-related disorders, we sought to determine the role of estrogens in regulating the circadian mechanisms underlying diet-induced obesity. When fed high- diet, C57BL/6J male mice gain weight while females are resistant to diet-induced obesity. Here we demonstrate that estradiol regulates circadian rhythms in females to confer resistance to diet-induced obesity. We found that ovariectomized females with undetectable circulating estrogens became obese and had disrupted daily rhythms of eating behavior and locomotor activity when fed high- diet. The phase of the liver molecular circadian rhythm was also altered by high- diet feeding in ovariectomized mice. Estradiol replacement in ovariectomized females fed high- diet rescued these behavioral and tissue rhythms. Additionally, restoring the daily rhythm of eating behavior in ovariectomized females with time-restricted feeding inhibited diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance. Together, these data suggest that the circadian system is a target for treating obesity and its comorbidities in women after menopause, when circulating levels of estrogens are too low to protect their circadian rhythms.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693486>GLP-1 signaling is required for improvement of glucose tolerance by osteocalcin.</a></h1><p>Osteocalcin is a bone-derived hormone that in its uncarboxylated form (GluOC) plays an important role in glucose and energy  by stimulating insulin secretion and pancreatic β-cell proliferation through its putative receptor GPRC6A. We previously showed that the effect of GluOC on insulin secretion is mediated predominantly by glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) released from intestinal endocrine cells in response to GluOC stimulation. Moreover, oral administration of GluOC was found to reduce the fasting blood glucose level, to improve glucose tolerance, and to increase the fasting serum insulin concentration and β-cell area in the pancreas in wild-type mice. We have now examined the effects of oral GluOC administration for at least 4 weeks in GLP-1 receptor knockout mice. Such administration of GluOC in the mutant mice triggered glucose intolerance, enhanced gluconeogenesis, and promoted both  accumulation in the liver as well as adipocyte hypertrophy and inflammation in adipose tissue. Furthermore, inactivation of GLP-1 receptor signaling in association with GluOC administration induced activation of the transcription factor FoxO1 and expression of its transcriptional coactivator PGC1α in the liver, likely accounting for the observed up-regulation of gluconeogenic gene expression.

Current insights and future perspectives for novel therapies.</a></h1><p>Dyslipidemia and inflammation are closely interrelated contributors in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. Disorders of  initiate an inflammatory and immune-mediated response in atherosclerosis, while low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) lowering has possible pleiotropic anti-inflammatory effects that extend beyond  lowering.Activation of the immune system/inflammasome destabilizes the plaque, which makes it vulnerable to rupture, resulting in major adverse cardiac events (MACE). The activated immune system potentially accelerates atherosclerosis, and atherosclerosis activates the immune system, creating a vicious circle. LDL-C enhances inflammation, which can be measured through multiple parameters like high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP). However, multiple studies have shown that CRP is a marker of residual risk and not, itself, a causal factor. Recently, anti-inflammatory therapy has been shown to decelerate atherosclerosis, resulting in fewer MACE. Nevertheless, an important side effect of anti-inflammatory therapy is the potential for increased infection risk, stressing the importance of only targeting patients with high residual inflammatory risk. Multiple (auto-)inflammatory diseases are potentially related to/influenced by LDL-C through inflammasome activation.Research suggests that LDL-C induces inflammation; inflammation is of proven importance in atherosclerotic disease progression; anti-inflammatory therapies yield promise in lowering (cardiovascular) disease risk, especially in selected patients with high (remaining) inflammatory risk; and intriguing new anti-inflammatory developments, for example, in nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat-containing pyrine receptor inflammasome targeting, are currently underway, including novel pathway interventions such as immune cell targeting and epigenetic interference. Long-term safety should be carefully monitored for these new strategies and cost-effectiveness carefully evaluated.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31676437>The lipoxygenase pathway of Tupaia belangeri representing Scandentia. Genomic multiplicity and functional characterization of the ALOX15 orthologs in the tree shrew.</a></h1><p>The tree shrew (Tupaia belangeri) is a rat-sized mammal, which is more closely related to humans than mice and rats. However, the use of tree shrew to explore the patho-mechanisms of human inflammatory disorders has been limited since nothing is known about eicosanoid  in this mammalian species. Eicosanoids are important  mediators exhibiting pro- and anti-inflammatory activities, which are biosynthesized via lipoxygenase and cyclooxygenase pathways. When we searched the tree shrew genome for the presence of cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase isoforms we found copies of functional COX1, COX2 and LOX genes. Interestingly, we identified four copies of ALOX15 genes, which encode for four structurally distinct ALOX15 orthologs (tupALOX15a-d). To explore the catalytic properties of these enzymes we expressed tupALOX15a and tupALOX15c as catalytically active proteins and characterized their enzymatic properties. As predicted by the Evolutionary Hypothesis of ALOX15 specificity we found that the two enzymes converted arachidonic acid predominantly to 12S-HETE and they also exhibited membrane oxygenase activities. However, their reaction kinetic properties (K for arachidonic acid and oxygen, T- and pH-dependence) and their substrate specificities were remarkably different. In contrast to mice and humans, tree shrew ALOX15 isoforms are highly expressed in the brain suggesting a role of these enzymes in cerebral function. The genomic multiplicity and the tissue expression patterns of tree shrew ALOX15 isoforms need to be considered when the results of in vivo inflammation studies obtained in this animal are translated into the human situation.Copyright © 2019.

Increasing evidence has demonstrated the crucial role of  in HCC progression. The function of apolipoprotein F (ApoF), a  transfer inhibitor protein, in HCC is incompletely understood. We aimed to evaluate the functional role of ApoF in HCC in this study.We used quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) to detect  mRNA expression in HCC tissues and hepatoma cell lines (SMMC-7721, HepG2, and Huh7). Immunohistochemistry was performed to detect the expression of ApoF in HCC tissues. The associations between ApoF expression and clinicopathological features as well as HCC prognosis were analyzed. The effect of ApoF on cellular proliferation and growth of SMMC-7721 and Huh7 cells was examined  and .ApoF expression was significantly down-regulated at both mRNA and protein levels in HCC tissues as compared with adjacent tissues. In SMMC-7721 and Huh7 HCC cells, ApoF overexpression inhibited cell proliferation and migration. In a xenograft nude mouse model, ApoF overexpression effectively controlled HCC growth. Kaplan-Meier analysis results showed that the recurrence-free survival rate of HCC patients with low ApoF expression was significantly lower than that of other HCC patients. Low ApoF expression was associated with several clinicopathological features such as liver cirrhosis, Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer stage and tumor-node-metastasis stage.ApoF expression was down-regulated in HCC, which was associated with low recurrence-free survival rate. ApoF may serve as a tumor suppressor in HCC and be a potential application for the treatment of this disease.© The Author(s) 2019.

Recently, increased water demand and siltation have threatened the viable hot springs near the margins of the lake where , the only fish surviving in the lake, live. These Lake Magadi tilapia largely depend on nitrogen-rich cyanobacteria for food and are 100% ureotelic. Their exceptionally high aerobic metabolic rate, together with their emaciated appearance, suggests that they are energy-limited. Therefore, we hypothesized that during food deprivation, Magadi tilapia would economize their energy expenditure and reduce metabolic rate, aerobic performance and urea-N excretion. Surprisingly, during a 5-day fasting period, routine metabolic rates increased and swimming performance (critical swimming speed) was not affected. Urea-N excretion remained stable despite the lack of their N-rich food source. Their nitrogen use switched to endogenous sources as liver and muscle protein levels decreased after a 5-day fast, indicating proteolysis. Additionally, fish relied on carbohydrates with lowered muscle glycogen levels, but there were no signs indicating use of  stores. Gene expression of gill and gut urea transporters were transiently reduced as were gill rhesus glycoprotein Rhbg and Rhcg-2. The reduction in gill glutamine synthetase expression concomitant with the reduction in Rh glycoprotein gene expression indicates reduced nitrogen/ammonia , most likely decreased protein synthesis. Additionally, fish showed reduced plasma total CO, osmolality and Na (but not Cl) levels, possibly related to reduced drinking rates and metabolic acidosis. Our work shows that Lake Magadi tilapia have the capacity to survive short periods of starvation which could occur when siltation linked to flash floods covers their main food source, but their seemingly hardwired high metabolic rates would compromise long-term survival.© The Author(s) 2019.

Snakebites are an important public health problem in tropical regions of the world. LED treatment is a therapeutic tool associated with serum therapy used to minimize the local effects of snakebites, including decrease in creatine kinase (CK) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) concentrations, myonecrosis, and inflammatory and haemorrhagic responses. In this study, we analysed the photobiomodulation effect of LED on the activation of murine macrophages induced by BthTX-I or BthTX-II isolated from Bothrops jararacussu venom. Photobiomodulation caused an increase in mitochondrial  and a considerable decrease in cytotoxicity in murine macrophages. Moreover, it induced a decrease in reactive oxygen species and nitrogen liberation. However, photobiomodulation caused an increase in macrophage phagocytic capacity and  droplet formation. The results of this study corroborated with those of others in an unprecedented way and provide a better understanding of the mechanism of action of photobiomodulation, besides offering a coadjuvant action treatment for the local effects of snakebites, not achieved with serum therapy alone.Copyright © 2019.

NAFLD refers to the accumulation of  in more than 5% of the liver without alcohol consumption. NAFLD is the most common liver disease and is rapidly becoming a global public health problem. Maoberry (Antidesma bunius) is a fruit rich in antioxidants, especially phenolic compounds, which are reported to have benefits for patients with NAFLD.We evaluated the effect of Maoberry extract on  in liver tissues of high  diet-induced rats. Five (5) groups (n = 12) of male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were divided into those given a high  diet with no treatment (HF), different dosages of Maoberry extracts (0.38 [ML], 0.76 [MM) and 1.52 [MH] g/kg body weight) and 10 mg/kg statin (STAT). The rats were fed a high  diet for 4 weeks to induce obesity and subsequently continued more for 12 weeks with treatments of Maoberry extracts or STAT. The levels of triglyceride, liver enzymes, oxidative stress and inflammation markers, triglyceride synthesis regulators, and pathology of the liver in high  diet-induced rats were investigated.Feeding Maoberry extract in MH groups resulted in decreasing levels of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), liver triglyceride, liver thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and mRNA expression of tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-6, glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (GPAT)-1 and acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase (ACC) compared with the HF group (P < 0.05).

However, SGA treatment is associated with severe metabolic alterations and body weight gain, which can increase the risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease, and greatly accelerate mortality. Several underlying mechanisms have been proposed for antipsychotic-induced weight gain (AIWG), but some studies suggest that metabolic changes in insulin-sensitive tissues can be triggered before the onset of AIWG. In this review, we give an outlook on current research about the metabolic disturbances provoked by SGAs, with a particular focus on whole-body glucose homeostasis disturbances induced independently of AIWG,  dysregulation or adipose tissue disturbances. Specifically, we discuss the mechanistic insights gleamed from cellular and preclinical animal studies that have reported on the impact of SGAs on insulin signaling, endogenous glucose production, glucose uptake and insulin secretion in the liver, skeletal muscle and the endocrine pancreas. Finally, we discuss some of the genetic and epigenetic changes that might explain the different susceptibilities of SGA-treated patients to the metabolic side-effects of antipsychotics.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672443>Fibroblast growth factor 21 in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.</a></h1><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) encompasses a spectrum of pathologies ranging from uncomplicated hepatic  accumulation to a state of lobular inflammation and hepatocyte ballooning, known as non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Currently, there are no reliable biomarkers or effective therapeutic options established for NAFLD. Nevertheless, there are several molecular targets in the pipeline, of which fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is one. FGF21 is secreted primarily from liver and has a plethora of metabolic functions. Pre-clinical and epidemiological studies indicate a relationship between circulating FGF21 levels and hepatic  content in both mice and humans. Moreover, animal studies have clearly shown that aberrant FGF21 signalling is a key pathological step in the development and progression of NAFLD. A recent Phase II clinical trial demonstrated that administration of an FGF21 analogue significantly reduced hepatic  in subjects with NASH. As such, FGF21 provides a novel target for future biomarker and therapeutic studies. This review appraises preclinical data to outline the current understanding of FGF21 function in both normal hepatic function and NAFLD. Epidemiological evidence is explored to delineate the relationship between circulating FGF21 levels and NAFLD in humans. Finally, we review the therapeutic effects of FGF21 in the treatment of NAFLD.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

All the tested diets affected differently the key metabolic pathways (KEGGs). Significant changes in the expression of steroid  gene were observed in the liver of animals fed with the tested diets (except the high- high fructose diet). Both high- and high-fructose diets caused a significant decrease in the expression of squalene synthase (FDFT1 gene) responsible for the initial stage of cholesterol synthesis. On the contrary, in animals fed with the high-cholesterol diet (0.5% cholesterol), expression of the FDFT1 gene did not differ from the control group; however, these animals were characterized by changes in the expression of glucose and glycogen synthesis genes, which could lead to the suppression of glycogen synthesis and gluconeogenesis. At the same time, this group demonstrated different liver tissue morphology in comparison with the animals fed with the high-fructose high- diet, manifested as the presence of  vacuoles of a smaller size in hepatocytes. The high-fructose and high-fructose high- diets affected the metabolic pathways associated with intracellular protein catabolism (endocytosis, phagocytosis, proteasomal degradation, protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum), tight junctions and intercellular contacts, adhesion molecules, and intracellular RNA transport. Rats fed with the high-fructose high- or high-cholesterol diets demonstrated consistent changes in the expression of the Crot, Prom1, and RGD1305464 genes, which reflected a coordinated shift in the regulation of  and carbohydrate metabolisms.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31683849>Cerebral White Matter Hyperintensity as a Healthcare Quotient.</a></h1><p>To better understand the risk factors and optimal therapeutic strategies of cerebral white matter hyperintensity (WMH), we examined a large population of adults with and without various vascular risk factors (VRFs) or vascular risk conditions (VRCs), such as hypertension (HT), diabetes mellitus (DM), and dyslipidemia (DLP), including the comorbidities. We assessed two participant groups having no medical history of stroke or dementia that underwent brain checkup using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): 5541 participants (2760 men, 2781 women) without VRCs and 1969 participants (1169 men, 800 women) who had received drug treatments for VRCs and the combination of comorbidities. For data analysis, we constructed WMH-brain healthcare quotient (WMH-BHQ) based on the percentile rank of WMH volume. This metric has an inverse relation to WMH. Multiple linear regression analysis of 5541 participants without VRCs revealed that age, systolic blood pressure (SBP), Brinkman index (BI), and female sex were significant factors lowering WMH-BHQ, whereas body mass index (BMI), male sex, fasting blood sugar, and triglyceride levels were increasing factors. The Kruskal-Wallis test and Dunn tests showed that WMH-BHQs significantly increased or decreased with BMI or SBP and with BI classification, respectively. Regarding the impact of impaired fasting glucose and abnormal , there were almost no significant relationships. For 1969 participants who had HT, DM, and DLP, as well as their comorbidities, we found that DLP played a substantial role in increasing WMH-BHQ for some comorbidities, whereas the presence of HT and DM alone tended to decrease it.

Endogenous reactive oxygen species (ROS) are by-products of oxidative phosphorylation. ROS are formed due to the inefficiency of oxidative phosphorylation, and lead to oxidative stress that affects mitochondrial . Chronic oxidative stress contributes to the onset of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). The immediate consequences of oxidative stress include  peroxidation, protein oxidation, and mitochondrial deoxyribonucleic acid (mtDNA) mutation, which induce neuronal cell death. Mitochondrial binding of amyloid-β (Aβ) protein has been identified as a contributing factor in AD. In PD and HD, respectively, α-synuclein (α-syn) and huntingtin (Htt) gene mutations have been reported to exacerbate the effects of oxidative stress. Similarly, abnormalities in mitochondrial dynamics and the respiratory chain occur in ALS due to dysregulation of mitochondrial complexes II and IV. However, oxidative stress-induced dysfunctions in neurodegenerative diseases can be mitigated by the antioxidant function of hydrogen sulfide (HS), which also acts through the potassium (K/K) ion channel and calcium (Ca) ion channels to increase glutathione (GSH) levels. The pharmacological activity of HS is exerted by both inorganic and organic compounds. GSH, glutathione peroxidase (Gpx), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) neutralize HO-induced oxidative damage in mitochondria. The main purpose of this review is to discuss specific causes and effects of mitochondrial oxidative stress in neurodegenerative diseases, and how these are impacted by the antioxidant functions of HS to support the development of advancements in neurodegenerative disease treatment.© The author(s).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31676432>Fibroblast growth Factor-21 promotes ketone body utilization in neurons through activation of AMP-dependent kinase.</a></h1><p>Energy supply to the brain is essential to ensure correct neuronal function, and glucose is the main fuel utilized by neurons. In metabolically challenging situations when glucose availability is restricted, brain cells may switch to alternative carbon substrates. This ensures energy supply to preserve the functions of the central nervous system. In this regard, ketone bodies, a by-product of , play a key role. They can replace glucose as the main source of ATP in the brain when glucose availability is very low, such as during fasting, extenuating exercise, or pathological situations such as diabetes. However, the mechanisms through which brain cells reprogram their  are not fully understood. Fibroblast growth factor-21 (FGF21) is an endocrine hormone that contributes to modulate systemic adaptation to fasting, and it is known to regulate ketone body  in peripheral tissues. However, its role in the brain, except for neuroendocrine regions, has not been studied in depth. In this work, we have used a combination of cell biology, biochemistry and extracellular flux analysis to examine the role of FGF21 in neuronal . We show that FGF21 increases the ability of neurons to utilize ketone bodies in cortical neurons as illustrated by a larger mitochondrial respiratory capacity in the presence of ketone bodies. Finally, we observe that the effect of FGF21 is mediated through a mechanism partly dependent on AMP-dependent kinase (AMPK). We propose that this mechanism could contribute to prepare the brain for fasting, thus preventing metabolic decline.Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Therefore, the main objective of this study was to investigate the association between objectively measured PA and different clinical adiposity measures in a large sample of preschoolers.Four hundred sixty-three predominantly normal-weight (77%) 2-6-year-old preschool children participated in the Swiss Preschoolers' Health Study (SPLASHY). Physical activity was measured using accelerometers and was analyzed using 15-s (uni-axial) epoch length using validated cut-offs. Adiposity measures included body mass index (BMI), the sum of four skinfolds, and waist circumference (WC). Multilevel linear regression modeling, adjusted for age, sex and wear time, was used to assess the association between PA and SB with BMI, WC, and skinfold thickness.Total PA and different PA intensities were positively and SB was inversely associated with BMI in the total sample and in the normal-weight children (p < 0.05). Total PA was inversely associated with skinfold thickness in overweight and obese children (p < 0.05), while there was only a weak association for vigorous PA (p > 0.05). Moderate and moderate-to-vigorous PA were positively, and SB was negatively associated with WC in the total sample and in the normal-weight children (p < 0.05). Additional adjustment for potential sociocultural and biological confounding variables attenuated some of the results.In this very young and predominantly normal-weight population, PA is positively related to BMI and WC, but this relationship is not observed in overweight and obese children. In this latter population, PA is inversely, and SB is positively related to skinfold thickness. Skinfold thickness could represent a useful and simple clinical measure of body  in preschoolers. The role of vigorous PA in the prevention of early childhood obesity should be further investigated in future studies.ISRCTN ISRCTN41045021 .

Poplar is a model woody plant, but the molecular events occurring during seed germination in this species are unclear.In this study, we investigated changes in gene transcriptional levels during different germination periods in poplar by high-throughput sequencing technology. Analysis of genes expressed at specific germination stages indicated that these genes are distributed in many metabolic pathways. Enrichment analysis of significantly differentially expressed genes based on hypergeometric testing revealed that multiple pathways, such as pathways related to glycolysis, , amino acid, protein and ATP synthesis , changed significantly at the transcriptional level during seed germination. A comparison of ΣZ values uncovered a series of transcriptional changes in biological processes related to primary  during poplar seed germination.

In addition, the expression of the  and  genes was investigated in the LT muscle by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Data were analyzed using polynomial contrasts (linear, quadratic and control vs. WDG). There was no interaction ( > 0.05) between aging times and the inclusion of WDG in the diets on the meat quality (pH, cooking losses, coloration and tenderness). However, diets with increasing levels of WDG caused a linear reduction ( = 0.01) in the intramuscular  of LT. The lipogenic genes  and  were less expressed ( < 0.05) in response to the inclusion of WDG. These results suggest that the inclusion of WDG reduced the expression of lipogenic genes and consequently the marbling of LT muscle without affecting tenderness (shear force) and meat color traits.©2019 Ferreira et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31678621>Angiopoietin-1 aggravates atherosclerosis by inhibiting cholesterol efflux and promoting inflammatory response.</a></h1><p>Angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1), a secreted protein, mainly regulates angiogenesis. Ang-1 has been shown to promote the development of atherosclerosis, whereas little is known about its effects on  and inflammation in this process.Ang-1 was transfected into ApoE mice via lentiviral vector or incubated with THP-1 derived macrophages. Oil red O and HE staining were performed to measure the size of atherosclerotic plaques in ApoE mice. Immunofluorescence was employed to show the expression of target proteins in aorta. [H] labeled cholesterol was performed to examine the efficiency of cholesterol efflux and reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) both in vivo and vitro. Western blot and qPCR were used to quantify target proteins both in vivo and vitro. ELISA detected the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in mouse peritoneal macrophage.Our data showed that Ang-1 augmented atherosclerotic plaques formation and inhibited cholesterol efflux. The binding of Ang-1 to Tie2 resulted in downregulation of LXRα, ABCA1 and ABCG1 expression via inhibiting the translocation of TFE3 into nucleus. In addition, Ang-1 decreased serum HDL-C levels and reduced reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) in ApoE-/- mice. Furthermore, Ang-1 induced  accumulation followed by increasing TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β，and MCP-1 produced by MPMs, as well as inducing M1 phenotype macrophage marker iNOS and CD86 expression in aorta of ApoE mice.Ang-1 has an adverse effect on cholesterol efflux by decreasing the expression of ABCA1 and ABCG1 via Tie2/TFE3/LXRα pathway, thereby promoting inflammation and accelerating atherosclerosis progression.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

In the second, eight rumen-fistulated bulls were assigned in a switch back design to evaluate the fatty acid profile of omasal fluid. We hypothesized that bulls fed DDGS may have an improved fatty acid profile and expression of genes involved in  may be altered, without affecting performance. Bulls fed DDGS had greater (P < .05) concentrations of PUFA n-6 in the omasum and muscle. CLA t10, c12 content was higher and there was lower expression of the LPL gene (P = .05) in the muscle of animals fed DDGS (P = .03). In conclusion, DDGS can be used as a protein feedstuff because it maintains beef quality.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Current evidence demonstrated that this canonical mechanism is evolutionary conserved. Thus, recent data demonstrated that inhibition of AMPKα2 in fish hypothalamus led to decreased food intake and liver capacity to use and synthesize glucose, , and amino acid. We hypothesize that a signal of abundance of nutrients from the hypothalamus controls hepatic . The vagus nerve is the most important link between the brain and the liver. We therefore examined in the present study whether surgical transection of the vagus nerve in rainbow trout is sufficient to alter the effect in liver of central inhibition of AMPKα2. Thus, we vagotomized (VGX) or not (SHAM) rainbow trouts, and then intracerebroventricularly administered adenoviral vectors tagged with GFP alone or linked to a dominant negative isoform of AMPKα2 (AMPKα2-DN). The inhibition of AMPKα2 led to a reduced food intake in parallel with changes in the mRNA abundance of hypothalamic neuropeptides () involved in food intake regulation. Central inhibition of AMPKα2 resulted in liver in decreased capacity of use and synthesis of glucose, , and amino acid. Notably, these effects mostly disappeared in VGX fish. These results support that the autonomic nervous system actions mediates the actions of hypothalamic AMPKα2 on liver . Importantly, this evidence indicates that the well-established role of hypothalamic AMPK on energy balance is a canonical evolutionary preserved mechanism that appeared at least in the fish lineage.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31691493>The fungal community and its interaction with the concentration of short-chain fatty acids in the faeces of Chenghua, Yorkshire and Tibetan pigs.</a></h1><p>Despite their important roles in host nutrition and , and potential to cause disease, our knowledge of the fungal community in the mammalian gut is quite limited. To date, diversity and composition of fungi in swine gut still remains unknown. Therefore, the first internal transcribed spacer of fungi in faecal samples from three breeds of pigs (10 pigs for each breed) was sequenced based on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform, and the relationship between the fungal community and the concentrations of main short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) was also analysed. Results indicated that Chenghua (local, higher body  rate), Yorkshire (foreign, higher lean meat and growth rate) and Tibetan (plateau, stronger disease resistance) pigs harboured distinct fungal community. The Basidiomycota and Ascomycota presented as the two predominant phyla, with Loreleia, Russula and Candida as the top three genera in all samples. Network analysis revealed a total of 35 correlations among different fungal genera, with 27 (77.14%) positive and 8 (22.86%) negative pairwise interactions. Canonical correspondence analysis suggested that fungi in the faeces of pigs were more correlated to the concentration of acetate and butyrate rather than propionate. Spearman's correlation further showed that Tomentella was positively correlated to both acetate and butyrate, and Loreleia was positively correlated to propionate (P < 0.05), while Nephroma and Taiwanofungus were negatively correlated to acetate and propionate (P < 0.05). These findings expanded our knowledge on the intestinal fungi in pigs with different genotypes and phenotypes, indicating that fungi may play an indispensable role during the  of host and the maintenance of intestinal health. The cross-feeding between fungi and other microorganisms may be crucial during the digestion of dietary carbohydrates and the associated physiological processes, which is worthy to be further studied.© 2019 The Authors.

However, the current production of IBDV vaccine faces serious batch instability and external contamination. The chicken embryonic fibroblast cell line DF-1 is widely used for the proliferation of avian viruses and vaccine production. Thus, optimizing the production of IBDV by DF-1 cells has an important application value. Combining metabolomics analysis and a Design of Experiments (DOE) statistical strategy, this study successfully optimized the process of IBDV production by DF-1 cells. Differential analysis and time series analysis of metabolite data in both IBDV-infected and uninfected DF-1 cells were performed by multivariate statistical analysis. The results showed that the intracellular metabolite intensities of glycolysis, the pentose phosphate pathway, the nucleoside synthesis pathway, , and glutathione  were upregulated, and the TCA cycle underwent a slight downregulation after IBDV infection of DF-1 cells. Based on the metabolome results and DOE statistical optimization method, the additive components suitable for IBDV proliferation were determined. The IBDV titer increased by 20.7 times upon exogenous addition of cysteine, methionine, lysine and nucleosides in the control medium, which is consistent with the predicted result (20.0 times) by a multivariate quadratic equation. This study provides a strategy for the efficient production of IBDV vaccines and could potentially be utilized to improve the production of other viral vaccines and biologics.Copyright © 2019.

Factors contributing to this predisposition include oxidized polyunsaturated fatty acids, also known as oxylipids, whose production is altered during the periparturient period and in diseased cattle. Alterations in the production of oxylipids derived from cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes are over-represented during times of increased disease risk and clinical disease, such as mastitis. Many of these same CYP450 enzymes additionally regulate  of -soluble vitamins, such as A, D, and E. These vitamins are essential to maintaining immune health, yet circulating concentrations are diminished near calving. Despite this, a relatively small amount of research has focused on the roles of CYP450 enzymes outside of the liver. The aim of this paper is to describe the relative gene expression of 11 CYP450 in bovine tissues and common in vitro bovine cell models. Eight tissue samples were collected from 3 healthy dairy cows after euthanasia. In vitro samples included primary bovine aortic and mammary endothelial cells and immortalized bovine kidney and mammary epithelial cells. Quantitative real-time-PCR was carried out to assess basal transcript expression of CYP450 enzymes. Surprisingly, CYP450 mRNA was widely expressed in all tissue samples, with predominance in the liver. In vitro CYP450 expression was less robust, with several cell types lacking expression of specific CYP450 enzymes altogether. Overall, cell culture models did not reflect expression of tissue CYP450. However, when CYP450 were organized by activity, certain cell types consistently expressed specific functional groups. These data reveal the widespread expression of CYP450 in individual organs of healthy dairy cows. Widespread expression helps to explain previous evidence of significant changes in CYP450-mediated oxylipid production and -soluble vitamin  in organ microenvironments during periods of oxidative stress or disease. As such, these data provide a foundation for targeted functional experiments aimed at understanding the activities of specific CYP450 and associated therapeutic potential during times of increased disease risk.Copyright © 2020 American Dairy Science Association.

In this study, we detected the polymorphism of the bovine  gene including all exons by PCR-SSCP and DNA sequencing methods with six pairs of PCR primers in 555 individuals from three cattle breeds. Three novel SNPs (NC_007308:g.47575 C > T, 47615 C > T, 47690A > G) were detected using P6 primer. The linkage disequilibrium analysis indicated that the three SNPs were completely linked ( = 1), which constructed three genotypes (AA, AB, BB). The genotype AB was dominant in all three breeds. The frequencies of haplotype A and haplotype B were almost equivalent between each other. The individuals with genotype AB were significantly higher than those individuals with genotype BB in body weight ( < 0.01), chest circumference ( < 0.05) and rump length ( < 0.05). Moreover, individuals with genotype AA were significantly higher than those of individuals with genotype BB in body height ( < 0.01).

The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanisms underlying the protective effects of SLBZS in a rat model of NAFLD using lipidomics and to evaluate the role of Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) in the mechanism of SLBZS against NAFLD. The rat model of NAFLD was induced by high- feeding. An ultra-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS)-based untargeted lipidomics approach was applied to analyze hepatic  alterations, and the SIRT1-selective inhibitor EX 527 was used to inhibit SIRT expression in the liver. The results of body and biochemical parameters, as well as histological changes, indicated that SLBZS administration exerted protective effects against NAFLD. Lipidomic analysis showed that 30  species were effectively regulated by SLBZS administration in rats fed a high- diet. Pathway analysis indicated that glycerophospholipid  and glycerolipid  were potential target pathways closely involved in the mechanism of SLBZS against NAFLD. Moreover, the beneficial effects of SLBZS on hepatic steatosis, some biochemical parameters and hepatic  species were partly diminished by SIRT1 inhibition. In conclusion, our results suggested that SLBZS administration could effectively alter some hepatic  species in rats fed a high- diet, which was mainly associated with the regulation of glycerophospholipid and glycerolipid . Furthermore, the beneficial effects of SLBZS on hepatic  may be at least partly attributed to SIRT1 activation in the liver.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31685793>Energy restriction in obese women suggest linear reduction of hepatic  content and time-dependent metabolic improvements.</a></h1><p>Energy restriction reduces liver , improves hepatic insulin resistance and . However, temporal data in which these metabolic improvements occur and their interplay is incomplete. By performing repeated MRI scans and blood analysis at day 0, 3, 7, 14 and 28 the temporal changes in liver  and related metabolic factors were assessed at five times during a low-calorie diet (LCD, 800-1100 kcal/day) in ten obese non-diabetic women (BMI 41.7 ± 2.6 kg/m) whereof 6 had NAFLD. Mean weight loss was 7.4 ± 1.2 kg (0.7 kg/day) and liver  decreased by 51 ± 16%, resulting in only three subjects having NAFLD at day 28. Marked alteration of insulin, NEFA, ALT and 3-hydroxybuturate was evident 3 days after commencing LCD, whereas liver  showed a moderate but a linear reduction across the 28 days. Other circulating-liver  markers (e.g. triglycerides, adiponectin, stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 index, fibroblast growth factor 21) demonstrated modest and variable changes. Marked elevations of NEFA, 3-hydroxybuturate and ALT concentrations occurred until day 14, likely reflecting increased tissue lipolysis,  oxidation and upregulated hepatic fatty acid oxidation. In summary, these results suggest linear reduction in liver , time-specific changes in metabolic markers and insulin resistance in response to energy restriction.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696328>Correction to: Extreme Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease (ASCVD) Risk Recognition.</a></h1><p>The original version of this article unfortunately contained a mistake.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692172>The vasodilator oxyfedrine inhibits aldehyde  and thereby sensitizes cancer cells to xCT-targeted therapy.</a></h1><p>The major cellular antioxidant glutathione (GSH) protects cancer cells from oxidative damage that can lead to the induction of ferroptosis, an iron-dependent form of cell death triggered by the aberrant accumulation of  peroxides. Inhibitors of the cystine-glutamate antiporter subunit xCT, which mediates the uptake of extracellular cystine and thereby promotes GSH synthesis, are thus potential anticancer agents. On the other hand, the efficacy of xCT-targeted therapy has been found to be diminished by metabolic reprogramming that affects redox status in cancer cells. The identification of drugs for combination with xCT inhibitors that are able to overcome resistance to xCT-targeted therapy might thus provide the basis for effective cancer treatment. We have now identified the vasodilator oxyfedrine (OXY) as a sensitizer of cancer cells to GSH-depleting agents including the xCT inhibitor sulfasalazine (SSZ). OXY contains a structural motif required for covalent inhibition of aldehyde dehydrogenase enzymes, and combined treatment with OXY and SSZ was found to induce accumulation of the cytotoxic aldehyde 4-hydroxynonenal and cell death in SSZ-resistant cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo. Microarray analysis of tumor xenograft tissue revealed cyclooxygenase-2 expression as a potential biomarker for the efficacy of such combination therapy. Furthermore, OXY-mediated ALDH inhibition was found to sensitize cancer cells to GSH depletion induced by radiation therapy in vitro. Our findings thus establish a rationale for repurposing of OXY as a sensitizing drug for cancer treatment with agents that induce GSH depletion.© 2019 The Authors.

In addition, fasting reduces inflammasome activity in the brain while improving learning. Here, we examine the impact of refeeding a low- diet (LFD) or high- diet (HFD) after fasting.Male wildtype (WT), caspase-1 knockout (KO) and/or IL-1 receptor 1 (IL-1R1) KO mice were fasted for 24 h or allowed ad libitum access to food (chow). Immediately after fasting, mice were allowed to refeed for 2 h in the presence of LFD, HFD or chow. Mouse learning was examined using novel object recognition (NOR) and novel location recognition (NLR). Caspase-1 activity was quantified in the brain using histochemistry (HC) and image analysis.Refeeding with a HFD but not a LFD or chow fully impaired both NOR and NLR. Likewise, HFD when compared to LFD refeeding increased caspase-1 activity in the whole amygdala and, particularly, in the posterior basolateral nuclei (BLp) by 2.5-fold and 4.6-fold, respectively. When caspase-1 KO or IL-1R1 KO mice were examined, learning impairment secondary to HFD refeeding did not occur. Equally, administration of n-acetylcysteine to fasted WT mice prevented HFD-dependent learning impairment and caspase-1 activation in the BLp. Finally, the free-fatty acid receptor 1 (FFAR1) antagonist, DC260126, mitigated learning impairment associated with HFD refeeding while blocking caspase-1 activation in the BLp.Consumption of a HFD after fasting impairs learning by a mechanism that is dependent on caspase-1 and the IL-1R1 receptor. These consequences of a HFD refeeding on the BLP of the amygdala appear linked to oxidative stress and FFAR1.Copyright © 2019.

LD mice of both sexes are sterile, but fertility can be restored with leptin injections. Mammary glands from lipodystrophic mice were rudimentary and lacked terminal end buds. Leptin-injected LD mice were able to become pregnant, showed normal pregnancy-associated glandular proliferation despite a smaller glandular area, were able to produce a small amount of milk that had grossly normal content of milk proteins and neutral lipids, but could not sustain pups to weaning. In order to separate the individual requirements for 1) adipokines such as leptin, 2) estradiol, and 3) physical epithelial-adipocyte interactions, we performed a series of experiments with both lipodystrophic mice and ob (obese mice with a mutation in the lep gene encoding the adipokine leptin) mice that received either estradiol treatment or preadipocyte transplant. The resulting  pad did not rescue the defect in mammary gland development in lipodystrophic mice. The defect also could not be rescued with estradiol pellets. Ob/ob mice, like LD mice, lack leptin and estradiol, but retain adipose tissue. Ob mice have defective mammary gland development. However, in striking contrast to what was observed in lipodystrophic mice, reconstitution of a WT  pad in ob mice rescued the defect in mammary gland development. Estradiol treatment did not rescue mammary gland development in ob mice. Therefore direct interaction between mammary gland epithelia and adipose is a requirement for full invasion and expansion of the gland, but is not required for glandular proliferation during pregnancy and milk production.Copyright © 2019.

Here, an integrated metabolomics and network pharmacology strategy was proposed to discover active TCM ingredients for the alleviation of cisplatin nephrotoxicity. First, by inquiring Human Metabolome Database (HMDB) we collected targets connected to 149 cisplatin nephrotoxicity related metabolites.

Common targets of both dysregulated metabolites and kidney damage were then used for TCM active ingredients screening applying network pharmacology approach. Eventually, 22 ingredients passed screening criteria and their anti-nephrotoxicity activity was assessed in human kidney tubular epithelial (HK2) cells. As a result, 14 ingredients were found effective, in which kaempferol showed relatively better activity. Further metabolomics analysis revealed that kaempferol exerted anti-nephrotoxicity effect in rat by regulating amino acid, pyrimidine and purine , as well as .

The scheduled autopsies revealed no abnormalities in histopathological examination of the major organs, except the testes. Atrophy of the seminiferous tubules and hyperplasia in the Leydig cells were found in the SOY and CAN groups. DNA microarray analysis indicated downregulation in the CAN and the HSO groups of genes encoding for gonadotropins in the pituitary gland and of enzymes and proteins involved in steroid hormone  in the testes, compared to the SOY group. Plasma levels of sex hormones in the CAN and HSO groups tended to be higher and testosterone and dihydrotestosteorne in the HSO group were significantly higher than in the SOY group. These results demonstrate that testes are morphologically and functionally affected by the dietary oils, while the plasma steroid hormone levels do not necessarily reflect the gene expression, probably owing to feedback regulation via the gonadal hormones in the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal axis.Copyright © 2019.

The aim of this project was to investigate if stimulation of beta-oxidation and mitochondrial proliferation by the mitochondrial-targeted compound 2-(tridec-12-yn-1-ylthio)acetic acid (1-triple TTA) would influence metabolites of the Trp-Kyn-NAD pathway. We wished to investigate how carnitine depletion by meldonium-treatment influenced these metabolites. After dietary treatment of male Wistar rats with 1-triple TTA for three weeks, increased hepatic mitochondrial- and peroxisomal fatty acid oxidation resulted. The plasma content of total carnitines decreased compared to control animals, whereas hepatic genes involved in CoA biosynthesis were upregulated by 1-triple TTA treatment. The plasma Trp level and individual metabolites in the kynurenine pathway were increased by 1-triple TTA, associated with decreased hepatic gene expression of indoleamine2,3-dioxygenase. 1-triple TTA treatment increased conversion of Trp to nicotinamide (Nam) as the plasma content of quinolinic acid, Nam and N1-methylnicotinamide (mNam) increased, accompanied with suppression of hepatic gene expression of α-amino-α-carboxymuconate-ε-semialdehyde decarboxylase. A positive correlation between mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation and Trp-derivatives was found. Almost identical results were obtained by 1-triple TTA in the presence of meldonium, which alone exerted minor effects. Moreover, the plasma Kyn:Trp ratio (KTR) correlated negatively to mitochondrial function. Whether increased flux through the Trp-NAD pathway increased redox status and lowered inflammation locally and systemically should be considered.Copyright © 2019.

Using Caenorhabditis elegans as an animal model, we determined the effect of nanopolystyrene exposure on  and its association with the response to nanopolystyrene. Exposure (from L1-larave to adult day-3) to 100 nm nanopolystyrene (≥1 μg/L) induced severe  accumulation and increase in expressions of mdt-15 and sbp-1 encoding two  metabolic sensors. Meanwhile, we found that SBP-1 acted downstream of intestinal MDT-15 during the control of response to nanopolystyrene. Intestinal transcriptional factor SBP-1 activated two downstream targets, fatty acyl CoA desaturase -6 and heat-shock protein HSP-4 (a marker of endoplasmic reticulum unfolded protein response (ER UPR)) to regulate nanopolystyrene toxicity. Both MDT-15 and SBP-1 were involved in the activation of ER-UPR in nanopolystyrene exposed nematodes. Moreover, SBP-1 regulated the innate immune response by activating -6 in nanopolystyrene exposed nematodes. In the intestine, function of MDT-15 and SBP-1 in regulating nanopolystyrene toxicity was under the control of upstream signaling cascade (PMK-1-SKN-1) in p38 MAPK signaling pathway.

Those who are homozygous have severe disease. The average worldwide prevalence of heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia is at least 1 in 500, although recent genetic epidemiological data from Denmark and next generation sequencing data suggest the frequency may be closer to 1 in 250. Diagnosis of familial hypercholesterolemia in children is based on elevated total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels or DNA-based analysis, or both. Coronary atherosclerosis has been detected in men with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia as young as 17 years old and in women with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia at 25 years old. Since the clinical complications of atherosclerosis occur prematurely, especially in men, lifelong treatment, started in childhood, is needed to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. In children with the disease, diet was the cornerstone of treatment but the addition of -lowering medications has resulted in a significant improvement in treatment. Anion exchange resins, such as cholestyramine and colestipol, were found to be effective, but they are poorly tolerated. Since the 1990s studies carried out on children aged 6 to 17 years with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia have demonstrated significant reductions in their serum total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. While statins seem to be safe and well-tolerated in children, their long-term safety in this age group is not firmly established. This is an update of a previously published version of this Cochane Review.To assess the effectiveness and safety of statins in children with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia.Relevant studies were identified from the Group's Inborn Errors and  Trials Register and Medline. Date of most recent search: 04 November 2019.Randomized and controlled clinical studies including participants up to 18 years old, comparing a statin to placebo or to diet alone.Two authors independently assessed studies for inclusion and extracted data.We found 26 potentially eligible studies, of which we included nine randomized placebo-controlled studies (1177 participants). In general, the intervention and follow-up time was short (median 24 weeks; range from six weeks to two years). Statins reduced the mean low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration at all time points (high-quality evidence). There may be little or no difference in liver function (serum aspartate and alanine aminotransferase, as well as creatinine kinase concentrations) between treated and placebo groups at any time point (low-quality evidence). There may be little or no difference in myopathy (as measured in change in creatinine levels) (low-quality evidence) or clinical adverse events (moderate-quality evidence) with statins compared to placebo. One study on simvastatin showed that this may slightly improve flow-mediated dilatation of the brachial artery (low-quality evidence), and on pravastatin for two years may have induced a regression in carotid intima media thickness (low-quality evidence). No studies reported rhabdomyolysis (degeneration of skeletal muscle tissue) or death due to rhabdomyolysis, quality of life or compliance to study medication.Statin treatment is an effective -lowering therapy in children with familial hypercholesterolemia. Few or no safety issues were identified. Statin treatment seems to be safe in the short term, but long-term safety remains unknown. Children treated with statins should be carefully monitored and followed up by their pediatricians and their care transferred to an adult lipidologist once they reach 18 years of age. Large long-term randomized controlled trials are needed to establish the long-term safety issues of statins.Copyright © 2019 The Cochrane Collaboration.

One group received an enriched-polyunsaturated  (diet P) and the other an enriched-monounsaturated  hypocaloric diet (diet M) during 12 weeks. The effects on serum biomarkers related to  and carbohydrate  were evaluated before and after the dietary intervention.after both diets, body mass index, weight,  mass, waist circumference, systolic blood pressure, plasma leptin concentration, and waist circumference decreased in all patients. After 12 weeks of intervention with diet P, plasma insulin levels and HOMA-IR decreased in A-allele carriers: delta: -7.3 ± 2.2 IU/L (p = 0.01), and delta: -2.8 ± 0.5 units (p = 0.02), respectively. The same changes in delta were observed after diet M in A-allele carriers: insulin delta: -5.9 ± 1.2 IU/L (p = 0.01), and HOMA-IR delta: -2.1 ± 0.8 units (p = 0.02). In A-allele carriers, LDL-cholesterol decreased and HDL-cholesterol increased after the dietary intervention with diet P: delta: -12.1 ± 4.3 mg/dL (p = 0.01), and delta: 2.6 ± 0.7 mg/dL (p = 0.01), respectively. No differences in  profile were observed after diet M. These improvements were not observed in non-A-allele carriers after both interventions.our study showed the association of the rs670 ApoA1 polymorphism with insulin resistance changes as induced by both diets.

It is therefore urgent to identify specific genes and pathways associated with its progression and prognosis.The differentially expressed genes in The Cancer Genome Atlas were analyzed to build the co-expression network by Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). Gene ontology (GO) as well as Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis were conducted for the selected genes. Module-clinical trait relationships were analyzed to explore the association with clinicopathological parameters. Log-rank tests and cox regression were used to identify the prognosis-related genes.The most related modules with CCA development were tan module containing 181 genes and salmon module with 148 genes. GO analysis suggested enrichment terms of digestion, hormone transport and secretion, epithelial cell proliferation, signal release, fibroblast activation, response to acid chemical, wnt, Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate . KEGG analysis demonstrated 15 significantly altered pathways including glutathione , wnt, central carbon , mTOR, pancreatic secretion, protein digestion, axon guidance, retinol , insulin secretion, salivary secretion,  digestion. Key genes of SOX2, KIT, PRSS56, WNT9A, SLC4A4, PRRG4, PANX2, PIR, RASSF8, MFSD4A, INS, RNF39, IL1R2, CST1, and PPP3CA might be potential prognostic markers for CCA, of which RNF39 and PRSS56 also showed significant correlation with clinical stage.Differentially expressed genes and key modules contributing to CCA development were identified by WGCNA.

Septic shock carries a mortality of up to ∼40% with no compelling evidence of promising therapy to reduce morbidity or mortality. Septic shock survivors are also prone to nosocomial infections. Treatment with toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) agonists have demonstrated significant protection against common nosocomial pathogens in various clinically relevant models of infection and septic shock. TLR4 agonists are derived from a bacteria cell wall or synthesized de novo, and more recently novel small molecule TLR4 agonists have also been developed. TLR4 agonists augment innate immune functions including expansion and recruitment of innate leukocytes to the site of infection. Recent studies demonstrate TLR4-induced leukocyte metabolic reprogramming of cellular  to improve antimicrobial function. Metabolic changes include sustained augmentation of macrophage glycolysis, mitochondrial function, and tricarboxylic acid cycle flux. These findings set the stage for the use of TLR4 agonists as standalone therapeutic agents or antimicrobial adjuncts in patient populations vulnerable to nosocomial infections.Copyright © 2019.

To assess the underlying mechanism of the lipodystrophy in homozygous mice (Bcs1l), these and wild-type control mice were subjected to a short 4-hour fast. The homozygotes had low baseline blood glucose values, but a similar decrease in response to fasting as in wild-type mice, resulting in hypoglycemia in the majority. Despite the already depleted glycogen and increased triacylglycerol content in the mutant livers, the mice responded to fasting by further depletion and increase, respectively. Increased plasma free fatty acids (FAs) upon fasting suggested normal capacity for mobilization of lipids from white adipose tissue into circulation. Strikingly, however, serum glycerol concentration was not increased concomitantly with free FAs, suggesting its rapid uptake into the liver and utilization for fuel or gluconeogenesis in the mutants. The mutant hepatocyte mitochondria were capable of responding to fasting by appropriate morphological changes, as analyzed by electron microscopy, and by increasing respiration. Mutants showed increased hepatic gene expression of major metabolic controllers typically associated with fasting response (Ppargc1a, Fgf21, Cd36) already in the fed state, suggesting a chronic starvation-like metabolic condition. Despite this, the mutant mice responded largely normally to fasting by increasing hepatic respiration and switching to FA utilization, indicating that the mechanisms driving these adaptations are not compromised by the CIII dysfunction. SUMMARY STATEMENT: Bcs1l mutant mice with severe CIII deficiency, energy deprivation and post-weaning lipolysis respond to fasting similarly to wild-type mice, suggesting largely normal systemic  mobilization and utilization mechanisms.Copyright © 2019.

Participants were randomized between two sequences (placebo followed by MCT or MCT followed by placebo) and took MCT jelly or placebo jelly (canola oil) by mouth three times daily (total daily  dose: 17.3 g MCT, or 19.7 g canola oil) for 30 days per phase. The primary outcome was cognition as measured by the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale, Chinese version (ADAS-Cog-C). The secondary outcome was self-care as measured by the activities of daily living scale (ADL) and changes in plasma metabolites.This study showed a significant (p < 0.01) reduction in ADAS-Cog-C scores between the MCT (2.62 points below baseline) and placebo interventions (2.57 points above baseline). Data from 46 (86.8%) APOE4 subjects who completed the entire study were analyzed. Changes in ADL scores were not significantly different between the MCT and placebo interventions (p > 0.05). The concentrations of TC, HDL-C, β-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate were significantly higher in the MCT group than in the placebo group (p < 0.05).

Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is the most serious form of NAFLD where inflammation causes liver damage that can progress to cirrhosis. We have characterized the gut microbiome composition in UK patients with biopsy-proven NASH (n = 65) and compared it to that in healthy controls (n = 76). We report a 7% lower Shannon alpha diversity in NASH patients without cirrhosis (n = 40) compared to controls ( = 2.7x 10) and a 14% drop in NASH patients with cirrhosis (n = 25,  = 5.0x 10). Beta diversity (Unweighted UniFrac distance) was also significantly reduced in both NASH ( = 5.6x 10) and NASH-cirrhosis ( = 8.1x 10) groups. The genus most strongly associated with NASH in this study was  (0.29% abundance in controls, 3.45% in NASH without cirrhosis (False Discovery Rate (FDR)  = .008), and 4.38% in NASH with cirrhosis (FDR  = .02)). This genus, which has been linked previously to obesity and atherosclerosis, was also positively correlated with fasting levels of triglycerides ( = .01) and total cholesterol ( = 1.2x 10) and negatively correlated with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( = 2.8x 10) suggesting that some of the pathways present in this microbial genus may influence  in the host. In patients, we also found decreased abundance of some of the  which are known to produce high levels of short-chain fatty acids which can lower inflammation. This may thus contribute to pathology associated with NASH.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31684199>High-Fructose Diet-Induced Metabolic Disorders Were Counteracted by the Intake of Fruit and Leaves of Sweet Cherry in Wistar Rats.</a></h1><p>Numerous studies have indicated that the use of plants rich in bioactive compounds may reduce the risk of non-communicable diseases. The aim of this study was to investigate how the addition of fruit and leaves to high-fructose diet affects , including the expression of genes involved in fatty acid synthesis and oxidation in the liver and adipose tissue, as well as oxidative stress and inflammation in Wistar rats. The animals were fed with AIN-93G diet, high fructose (HFr) diet, HFr diet with addition of 5% or 10% freeze-dried fruits, and HFr diet with addition of 1% or 3% freeze-dried leaves. The experiment lasted 12 weeks. The results showed that the intake of fruit and leaves of sweet cherry caused the improvement of the liver function, as well as beneficially affected , among others, by regulating the expression of genes associated with fatty acid synthesis and β-oxidation. Additionally, they exhibited antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. In conclusion, the addition of fruit and leaves reduced the adverse changes arising from the consumption of high fructose diet. Therefore, not only commonly consumed fruits, but also leaves can be potentially used as functional foods. These findings may be helpful in prevention and treatment of the obesity-related metabolic diseases, especially cardiovascular diseases.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31676441>PPARA/RXRA signalling regulates the fate of hepatic non-esterified fatty acids in a sheep model of maternal undernutrition.</a></h1><p>Maternal undernutrition during late gestation accelerates body  mobilization to provide more energy for foetal growth and development, which unbalances metabolic homeostasis and results in serious  disorder. However, detailed regulatory mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, a sheep model was used to explore the regulatory role of PPARA/RXRA signalling in hepatic  in undernutrition based on RNA sequencing and cell experiments. KOG function classification showed that  transport and  was markedly altered in an undernourished model. In detail, when compared with the controls, fatty acid transport and oxidation and triglyceride  were up-regulated in an undernourished model, while fatty acid synthesis, steroid synthesis, and phospholipid  were down-regulated. Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis demonstrated that PPARA/RXRA signalling pathway was altered. Moreover, PPARA signalling associated genes were positively correlated with hepatic non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA) levels, while retinol  associated genes were negatively correlated with blood beta-hydroxybutyric acid (BHBA) levels. Results of primary hepatocytes showed that NEFAs could activate PPARA signalling and facilitate fatty acid oxidation (FAO) and ketogenesis, while BHBA could inhibit RXRA signalling and repress FAO and ketogenesis. Excessively accumulated NEFAs in hepatocytes promoted triglyceride synthesis. Furthermore, activation of PPARA/RXRA signalling by WY14643 and 9-cis-retinoic acid could enhance FAO and ketogenesis and reduce NEFAs accumulation and esterification. Our findings elucidate the regulatory mechanisms of NEFAs and BHBA on  as well as the potential role of the PPARA/RXRA signalling pathway in hepatic , which may contribute to exploring new strategies to maintain  metabolic homeostasis in human beings.Copyright © 2019.

While the primary function of ABCA7 is to regulate the transport of phospholipids and cholesterol, ABCA7 is also involved in maintaining homeostasis of the immune system. Since inflammatory pathways causatively or consequently participate in AD pathogenesis, we studied the effects of  haplodeficiency in mice on brain immune responses under acute and chronic conditions. When acute inflammation was induced through peripheral lipopolysaccharide injection in control or heterozygous  knockout mice, partial ABCA7 deficiency diminished proinflammatory responses by impairing CD14 expression in the brain. On breeding to   knockin mice, we observed increased amyloid-β (Aβ) accumulation and abnormal endosomal morphology in microglia. Taken together, our results demonstrate that ABCA7 loss of function may contribute to AD pathogenesis by altering proper microglial responses to acute inflammatory challenges and during the development of amyloid pathology, providing insight into disease mechanisms and possible treatment strategies.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31690648>Myeloid HMG-CoA (3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A) Reductase Determines Adipose Tissue Inflammation, Insulin Resistance And Hepatic Steatosis In Diet-Induced Obese Mice.</a></h1><p>Adipose tissue macrophages (ATMs) are involved in the development of insulin resistance in obesity. We have recently shown that myeloid cell-specific reduction of 3- hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (  ), which is the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis, protects against atherosclerosis by inhibiting macrophage migration in mice. We hypothesized that ATMs are harder to accumulate in   mice than control   mice in the setting of obesity. To test this hypothesis, we fed   and   mice with a high- diet (HFD) for 24 weeks and compared plasma glucose  as well as insulin signaling and histology between the two groups. Myeloid cell-specific reduction of  improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity without altering body weight in the HFD-induced obese mice. The improvement was due to a decrease in the numbers of ATMs. The ATMs were reduced by decreased recruitment of macrophages due to their impaired chemotactic activity. These changes were associated with decreased expression of proinflammatory cytokines in the adipose tissues. Myeloid cell-specific reduction of  also attenuated hepatic steatosis. In conclusion, reducing myeloid HMGCR may be a promising strategy to improve insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis in obesity.© 2019 by the American Diabetes Association.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31678479>Fatty acid synthase and stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 are conserved druggable cofactors of Old World Alphavirus genome replication.</a></h1><p>Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is a rapidly emerging mosquito-borne RNA virus that causes epidemics of debilitating disease in tropical and sub-tropical regions with autochtonous transmission in regions with temperate climate. Currently, there is no licensed vaccine or specific antiviral drug available against CHIKV infection. In this study, we examine the role, in the CHIKV viral cycle, of fatty acid synthase (FASN) and stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD1), two key lipogenic enzymes required for fatty acid production and early desaturation. We show that both enzymes and their upstream regulator PI3K are required for optimal CHIKV infection. We demonstrate that pharmacologic manipulation of FASN or SCD1 enzymatic activity by non-toxic concentrations of cerulenin or CAY10566 decreases CHIKV genome replication. Interestingly, a similar inhibitory effect was also obtained with Orlistat, an FDA-approved anti-obesity drug that targets FASN activity. These drugs were also effective against Mayaro virus (MAYV), an under-studied arthritogenic Old world Alphavirus endemic in South American countries with potential risk of emergence, urbanization and dispersion to other regions. Altogether, our results identify FASN and SCD1 as conserved druggable cofactors of Alphavirus genome replication and support the broad-spectrum activity of drugs targeting the host fatty acids .Copyright © 2019.

Although gender differences in MetS are well documented, little is known about sex-specific differences in the pathogenesis of COPD, especially when combined with MetS. Consequently, it is not clear whether the same treatment regime has comparable efficacy in men and women diagnosed with MetS and COPD. In the present study using sodium glutamate, lipopolysaccharide, and cigarette smoke extract, we simulated  disorders, obesity, hyperglycemia, and pulmonary emphysema (comorbidity) in male and female C57BL/6 mice. We assessed the gender-specific impact of  disorders and pulmonary emphysema on angiogenic precursor cells (endothelial progenitor cells (EPC), pericytes, vascular smooth muscle cells, cells of the lumen of the nascent vessel), as well as the biological effects of pegylated glucagon-like peptide 1 (pegGLP-1) in this experimental paradigm. Simulation of MetS/COPD comorbidity caused an accumulation of EPC (CD45CD31CD34), pericytes, and vascular smooth muscle cells in the lungs of female mice. In contrast, the number of cells involved in the angiogenesis decreased in the lungs of male animals. PegGLP-1 had a positive effect on lipids and area under the curve (AUC), obesity, and prevented the development of pulmonary emphysema. The severity of these effects was stronger in males than in females. Furthermore, PegGLP-1 stimulated regeneration of pulmonary endothelium. At the same time, PegGLP-1 administration caused a mobilization of EPC (CD45CD31CD34) into the bloodstream in females and migration of precursors of angiogenesis and vascular smooth muscle cells to the lungs in male animals. Gender differences in stimulatory action of pegGLP-1 on CD31 endothelial lung cells in vitro were not observed. Based on these findings, we postulated that the cellular mechanism of in vivo regeneration of lung epithelium was at least partly gender-specific. Thus, we concluded that a pegGLP-1-based treatment regime for metabolic disorder and COPD should be further developed primarily for male patients.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31678900>Bile acid abnormality induced by intestinal dysbiosis might explain  in Parkinson's disease.</a></h1><p>Intestinal dysbiosis refers to an imbalance in the intestinal flora. The concept of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO), a condition of abnormal proliferation of the small intestine microbiota, has been proposed as a form of small intestine dysbiosis. In Parkinson's disease patients, weight loss and metabolic disorders such as  abnormalities are frequently encountered. This was a prospective investigation of the presence of SIBO using the lactulose breath test, Parkinson's disease symptoms, medications, abdominal symptoms, and blood data involving 39 Parkinson's disease patients. Of the 39 patients, 19 were positive for SIBO, 16 were negative, and 4 were equivocal. SIBO-positive patients had a significantly smaller dopaminergic drug load (dopamine replacement of Parkinson's disease drug potency) (P = 0.009) and significantly lower serum triglyceride (TG) (P = 0.024) and total bilirubin (P = 0.019) levels. No relationship was seen between the presence or absence of SIBO and motor or abdominal symptoms. The following hypothesis was developed with regard to the possibility that intestinal bacterial overgrowth has various effects that are exhibited via bile acid  in Parkinson's disease patients. Serum bilirubin levels become higher as bilirubin  declines with decreases in the intestinal bacteria. At the same time, bile acid is broken down due to increased intestinal bacteria, and  absorption decreases. This induces low serum TG levels and leads to weight loss. By a similar mechanism, there is less absorption of vitamin D as bile acid levels decrease, leading to osteoporosis and fractures. The possibility that some of the non-motor manifestations accompanying Parkinson's disease are caused by intestinal dysbiosis needs to be considered.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Insulin and insulin like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) share many intracellular processes with both known to play a key role in glucose and protein  in skeletal muscle.We aimed to compare IGF/IP6K1/Akt signalling and the plasma proteomic signature in individuals with a range of BMIs after ingestion of lean meat.Ten lean [Body mass index (BMI) (in kg/m): 22.7 ± 0.4; Homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA): 1.36 ± 0.17], 10 overweight (BMI: 27.1 ± 0.5; HOMA: 1.25 ± 0.11), and 10 obese (BMI: 35.9 ± 1.3; HOMA: 5.82 ± 0.81) adults received primed continuous L-[ring-C]phenylalanine infusions. Blood and muscle biopsy samples were collected at 0 min (post-absorptive), 120 min and 300 min relative to the ingestion of 170 g pork loin (36 g protein and 5 g ) to examine skeletal muscle protein signalling, plasma proteomic signatures, and whole-body phenylalanine disappearance rates (R).Phenylalanine R was not different in obese compared to lean individuals at all time points and was not responsive to a pork ingestion (basal, P = .056; 120 & 300 min, P > .05). IP6K1 was elevated in obese individuals at 120 min post-prandial vs basal (P < .05). There were no acute differences plasma proteomic profiles between groups in the post-prandial state (P > .05).These data demonstrate, for the first time that muscle IP6K1 protein content is elevated after lean meat ingestion in obese adults, suggesting that IP6K1 may be contributing to the dysregulation of nutrient uptake in skeletal muscle. In addition, proteomic analysis showed no differences in proteomic signatures between obese, overweight or lean individuals.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The aim of this study was to explore the molecular mechanisms of its role in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).NAFLD mouse models were established by using eight-week-old male C57BL/6 mice fed with high- diet (HFD) or (and) lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for 18 weeks. From the beginning of HFD, HFD-induced mice were subjected to amlexanox or vehicle for 18 weeks. HFD+LPS-induced mice were treated with amlexanox or vehicle for the last 6 weeks. Blood biochemistry parameters were determined using automatic biochemistry analyzer. Histological changes of liver tissue were observed by hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining and Oil Red O staining. The expressions of IKKε and smooth muscle actin-α (α-SMA) were evaluated through immunohistochemistry. Serum inflammatory mediator was determined by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Gene expressions involved in glucose and , insulin signaling pathway were examined using quantitative RT-PCR or Western blotting.This study demonstrated that amlexanox reversed glucose and  metabolic disturbance and hepatic steatosis in NAFLD mice model. IKKε was specific expressed in hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) instead of hepatocytes. This study also found that amlexanox improved insulin signaling (Insulin-IRS-1-Akt) in hepatocytes through inhibiting inflammation (IKKε-NF-κB-TNF-α/IL-1α) in HSCs.The present study confirmed that IKKε was specific expressed in HSCs. Inhibition of activated HSCs was responsible for effects of amlexanox on NAFLD, with improving insulin signal pathway in hepatocytes.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

All of these problems have resulted in a lot of diverging results concerning measured and reported glucagon responses in both humans and experimental animals that have and still are causing considerable debate and controversy. There is very solid evidence that glucagon is an important hormone in human and mammalian , but its precise physiological role in glucose and  and in metabolic disease has been difficult to establish, not least because of these difficulties. It was our purpose with this review to discuss the methods of glucagon quantification and discuss pitfalls and sources of error. We also reviewed some of the dogmas regarding glucagon secretion in the light of the methodological difficulties.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31680310>Choline and methionine regulate  via the AMPK signaling pathway in hepatocytes exposed to high concentrations of nonesterified fatty acids.</a></h1><p>High concentrations of nonesterified fatty acids (NEFAs) and β-hydroxybutyric acid (BHBA) induce  peroxidation, resulting in liver damage. Choline and methionine (Met) can promote energy balance and benefit liver health in transition dairy cows; however, the regulating mechanism remains unclear. In the present study, we established the hepatocyte damage model by 1.5 mM NEFAs or BHBA treatment, and examined  in hepatocytes. The results showed that 1.5 mM NEFAs and 1.5 mM BHBA significantly decreased the messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-α as well as its target genes carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1α (CPT-1α), acetyl-CoA carboxylase, fatty acid synthetase, and Apolipoprotein B100 (ApoB100). Choline and Met upregulated the phosphorylation level of AMPK-α, which was blocked by BML (an AMPK-α inhibitor). The mRNA expression level of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α (PPAR-α), CPT-1α, and ApoB100 showed a similar trend. The expressions of liver X recptoer α (LXR-α) and sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c (SREBP-1c) were decreased by choline and Met, while only the decrease of LXR-α was blocked by BML. These findings indicate that the high-level NEFAs and BHBA weaken the  by impairing the fatty acid oxidation, synthesis, and transport proteins. Choline and Met regulate PPAR-α and LXR-α transcriptional activity through AMPK-α phosphorylation and regulate SREBP-1c independently of AMPK-α to promote  oxidation and transport in NEFAs-treated hepatocytes.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695245>Whole-Exome Sequencing Identifies a Variant in Phosphatidylethanolamine N-Methyltransferase Gene to be Associated With Lean-Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease.</a></h1><p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a spectrum of liver diseases with simple steatosis on one end and hepatocellular carcinoma on the other. Although obesity is a known risk factor for NAFLD, individuals with normal body mass index (BMI) also have hepatic fatty infiltration, now termed "lean-NAFLD". It represents a distinct entity with a strong underlying genetic component. The present study aimed to sequence the complete exonic regions of individuals with lean-NAFLD to identify germline causative variants associated with disrupted hepatic fatty acid , thereby conferring susceptibility to NAFLD.Whole blood was collected from patients with lean-NAFLD (n = 6; BMI < 23.0 kg/m) and matched lean controls (n = 2; discovery set). Liver  was assessed using acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) imaging. Patients with ultrasound-detected NAFLD (n = 191) and controls (n = 105) were part of validation set. DNA was isolated, and whole-exome sequencing (WES) was performed in the discovery cohort (Ion Proton™; Ion AmpliSeq™ Exome RDY Kit). Data were analyzed (Ion Reporter software; Life Technologies), and variants identified. Validation of variants was carried out (Taqman probes; Real time-PCR). Student's t test and Fisher's exact test were used to analyze the statistical significance.Although WES identified ∼74,000 variants in individual samples, using various pipelines. variants in genes namely phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PEMT) and oxysterol-binding protein-related protein10 (OSBPL10) that have roles in dietary choline intake and regulation of cholesterol homeostasis, respectively, were identified (discovery set). Furthermore, significant differences were noted in BMI (p = 0.006), waist/hip circumference (p > 0.001), waist/hip ratio (p > 0.001), aspartate aminotransferase (p > 0.001), alanine aminotransferase (p > 0.001), and triglycerides (p = 0.002) between patients and controls. Validation of variants (rs7946-PEMT and rs2290532-OSBPL10) revealed that variant in PEMT but not OSBPL10 gene was associated (p = 0.04) with threefold increased risk of NAFLD in lean individuals.Our results demonstrate the association of rs7946 with lean-NAFLD.

Acots in the mitochondrial matrix are poised to mitigate β-oxidation overload and maintain CoA availability. Several Acots associate with mitochondria, but whether they all localize to the matrix, are redundant, or have different roles is unresolved. Here, we compared the suborganellar localization, activity, expression, and regulation among mitochondrial Acots (Acot2, 7, 9, and 13) in mitochondria from multiple mouse tissues and from a model of Acot2 depletion. Acot7, 9, and 13 localized to the matrix, joining Acot2 that was previously shown to localize there. Mitochondria from heart, skeletal muscle, brown adipose tissue, and kidney robustly expressed Acot2, 9, and 13; Acot9 levels were substantially higher in brown adipose tissue and kidney mitochondria, as was activity for C4:0-CoA, a unique Acot9 substrate. In all tissues, Acot2 accounted for about half of the thioesterase activity for C14:0-CoA and C16:0-CoA. In contrast, liver mitochondria from fed and fasted mice expressed little Acot activity, which was confined to long-chain CoAs and due mainly to Acot7 and Acot13 activities. Matrix Acots occupied different functional niches, based on substrate specificity (Acot9 vs. Acot2 and 13) and strong CoA inhibition (Acot7, 9, and 13, but not Acot2). Interpreted in the context of β-oxidation, CoA inhibition would prevent Acot-mediated suppression of β-oxidation, while providing a release valve when CoA is limiting. In contrast, CoA-insensitive Acot2 could provide a constitutive syphon for long-chain fatty acyl-CoAs. These results reveal how the family of matrix Acots can mitigate β-oxidation overload and prevent CoA limitation.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673703>Glucagon-Receptor Signaling Reverses Hepatic Steatosis Independent of Leptin Receptor Expression.</a></h1><p>Glucagon (GCG) is an essential regulator of glucose and  that also promotes weight loss. We have shown that glucagon-receptor (GCGR) signaling increases fatty acid oxidation (FAOx) in primary hepatocytes and reduces liver triglycerides in diet-induced obese (DIO) mice; however, the mechanisms underlying this aspect of GCG biology remains unclear. Investigation of hepatic GCGR targets elucidated a potent and previously unknown induction of leptin receptor (Lepr) expression. Liver leptin signaling is known to increase FAOx and decrease liver triglycerides, similar to glucagon action. Therefore, we hypothesized that glucagon increases hepatic LEPR, which is necessary for glucagon-mediated reversal of hepatic steatosis. Eight week-old control and liver-specific, LEPR-deficient mice (LeprΔliver) were placed on a high  diet (HFD) for 12 weeks and then treated with a selective GCGR agonist (IUB288) for 14 days. Liver triglycerides and gene expression were assessed in liver tissue homogenates. Administration of IUB288 in both lean and DIO mice increased hepatic Lepr isoforms a-e in acute (4h) and chronic (72h,16d) (p<0.05) settings. LeprΔliver mice displayed increased hepatic triglycerides on a chow diet alone (p<0.05), which persisted in a DIO state (p<0.001), with no differences in body weight or composition. Surprisingly, chronic administration of IUB288 in DIO control and LeprΔliver mice reduced liver triglycerides regardless of genotype (p<0.05). Together these data suggest that GCGR activation induces hepatic Lepr expression and although hepatic glucagon and leptin signaling have similar liver  targets, these appear to be two distinct pathways.© Endocrine Society 2019.

Theabrownin is one of the most active and abundant pigments in Pu-erh tea. Here, we show that theabrownin alters the gut microbiota in mice and humans, predominantly suppressing microbes associated with bile-salt hydrolase (BSH) activity. Theabrownin increases the levels of ileal conjugated bile acids (BAs) which, in turn, inhibit the intestinal FXR-FGF15 signaling pathway, resulting in increased hepatic production and fecal excretion of BAs, reduced hepatic cholesterol, and decreased lipogenesis. The inhibition of intestinal FXR-FGF15 signaling is accompanied by increased gene expression of enzymes in the alternative BA synthetic pathway, production of hepatic chenodeoxycholic acid, activation of hepatic FXR, and hepatic lipolysis. Our results shed light into the mechanisms behind the cholesterol- and -lowering effects of Pu-erh tea, and suggest that decreased intestinal BSH microbes and/or decreased FXR-FGF15 signaling may be potential anti-hypercholesterolemia and anti-hyperlipidemia therapies.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31684957>Hepatitis C virus nonstructural protein 5A perturbs  by modulating AMPK/SREBP-1c signaling.</a></h1><p>Steatosis is an important clinical manifestation associated with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a major mediator of , regulates HCV-associated hepatic steatosis, but the underlying mechanisms remain obscure. Here we investigated the mechanism of HCV nonstructural protein 5A (NS5A)-induced  accumulation by the AMPK/SREBP-1c pathway.We generated model mice by injecting recombinant lentiviral particles expressing the NS5A protein (genotype 3a) via the tail vein. The serum levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), free fatty acids (FFAs) and triglycerides (TG) were examined. H&E and Oil Red O staining were used to examine  droplets. Immunohistochemistry staining, quantitative real-time PCR and Western blotting were used to determine the expression of lipogenic genes.Our results showed that the serum levels of ALT, FFAs and TG, as well as the accumulation of hepatic  droplets, were increased significantly in mice infected with NS5A-expressing lentiviral particles. NS5A inhibited AMPK phosphorylation and increased the expression levels of sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c), acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase 1 (ACC1) and fatty acid synthase (FASN) in vivo and in vitro. Further investigation revealed that pharmacological activation or ectopic expression of AMPK neutralized the upregulation of SREBP-1c, ACC1 and FASN, and ameliorated hepatic  accumulation induced by NS5A. Ectopic expression of SREBP-1c enhanced NS5A-induced hepatic  accumulation, which was dramatically reversed by pharmacological activation of AMPK.Collectively, we demonstrate that NS5A induces hepatic  accumulation via the AMPK/SREBP-1c pathway.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31677149>A novel nanogel loaded with chitosan decorated bilosomes for transdermal delivery of terbutaline sulfate: artificial neural network optimization, in vitro characterization and in vivo evaluation.</a></h1><p>The objective of the present work was to formulate, optimize, and evaluate transdermal terbutaline sulfate (TBN)-loaded bilosomes (BLS) in gel, compared to conventional oral TBN solution and transdermal gel loaded with free TBN, aiming at evading the hepatic first-pass . A face-centered central composite design was adopted to observe the effects of different formulation variables on TBN-BLS, and artificial neural network (ANN) modeling was employed to optimize TBN-BLS. TBN-BLS were prepared by a thin film hydration method integrating soybean phosphatidylcholine and cholesterol as a  phase and sodium deoxycholate (SDC) as a surfactant with or without the coating of chitosan (CTS). After being subjected to physicochemical characterization, TBN-BLS were enrolled in a histopathological study and pharmacokinetic investigation in a rat model. The optimized TBN chitosan-coated bilosomes (TBN-CTS-BLS) were spherical vesicles (245.13 ± 10.23 nm) with adequate entrapment efficiency (65.25 ± 5.51%) and good permeation characteristics (340.11 ± 22.34 μg/cm). The TBN-CTS-BLS gel formulation was well-tolerated with no inflammatory signs manifested upon histopathological evaluation. The pharmacokinetic study revealed that the optimized TBN-CTS-BLS formulation successively enhanced the bioavailability of TBN by about 2.33-fold and increased t to about 6.21 ± 0.24 h as compared to the oral solution. These findings support the prospect use of BLS as active and safe transdermal carrier for TBN in the treatment of asthma.

The incorporation of genomic tools may help to accelerate selection. We genotyped 529 individuals using a high-density SNP chip (600 K, Affymetrix®) to estimate genomic heritability of performance traits and to identify genomic regions and their positional candidate genes associated with performance traits in a Brazilian F Chicken Resource population. Regions exhibiting selection signatures and a SNP dataset from resequencing were integrated with the genomic regions identified using the chip to refine the list of positional candidate genes and identify potential causative mutations.Feed intake (FI), feed conversion ratio (FC), feed efficiency (FE) and weight gain (WG) exhibited low genomic heritability values (i.e. from 0.0002 to 0.13), while body weight at hatch (BW1), 35 days-of-age (BW35), and 41 days-of-age (BW41) exhibited high genomic heritability values (i.e. from 0.60 to 0.73) in this F population. Twenty unique 1-Mb genomic windows were associated with BW1, BW35 or BW41, located on GGA1-4, 6-7, 10, 14, 24, 27 and 28. Thirty-eight positional candidate genes were identified within these windows, and three of them overlapped with selection signature regions. Thirteen predicted deleterious and three high impact sequence SNPs in these QTL regions were annotated in 11 positional candidate genes related to osteogenesis, skeletal muscle development, growth, energy  and , which may be associated with body weight in chickens.The use of a high-density SNP array to identify QTL which were integrated with whole genome sequence signatures of selection allowed the identification of candidate genes and candidate causal variants. One novel QTL was detected providing additional information to understand the genetic architecture of body weight traits. We identified QTL for body weight traits, which were also associated with fatness in the same population. Our findings form a basis for further functional studies to elucidate the role of specific genes in regulating body weight and  deposition in chickens, generating useful information for poultry breeding programs.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671738>Post-Translational Deimination of Immunological and Metabolic Protein Markers in Plasma and Extracellular Vesicles of Naked Mole-Rat ().</a></h1><p>Naked mole-rats are long-lived animals that show unusual resistance to hypoxia, cancer and ageing. Protein deimination is an irreversible post-translational modification caused by the peptidylarginine deiminase (PAD) family of enzymes, which convert arginine into citrulline in target proteins. Protein deimination can cause structural and functional protein changes, facilitating protein moonlighting, but also leading to neo-epitope generation and effects on gene regulation. Furthermore, PADs have been found to regulate cellular release of extracellular vesicles (EVs), which are -vesicles released from cells as part of cellular communication. EVs carry protein and genetic cargo and are indicative biomarkers that can be isolated from most body fluids. This study was aimed at profiling deiminated proteins in plasma and EVs of naked mole-rat. Key immune and metabolic proteins were identified to be post-translationally deiminated, with 65 proteins specific for plasma, while 42 proteins were identified to be deiminated in EVs only. Using protein-protein interaction network analysis, deiminated plasma proteins were found to belong to KEEG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) pathways of immunity, infection, cholesterol and drug , while deiminated proteins in EVs were also linked to KEEG pathways of HIF-1 signalling and glycolysis. The mole-rat EV profiles showed a poly-dispersed population of 50-300 nm, similar to observations of human plasma. Furthermore, the EVs were assessed for three key microRNAs involved in cancer, inflammation and hypoxia. The identification of post-translational deimination of critical immunological and metabolic markers contributes to the current understanding of protein moonlighting functions, via post-translational changes, in the longevity and cancer resistance of naked mole-rats.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693781>Phosphoinositides in Autophagy: Current Roles and Future Insights.</a></h1><p>Today the importance of autophagy in physiological processes and pathological conditions is undeniable. Initially autophagy merely was described as an evolutionarily conserved mechanism to maintain metabolic homeostasis in times of starvation, however in recent years it is now apparent that autophagy is a powerful regulator of many facets of cellular , that its deregulation contributes to various human pathologies, including cancer and neurodegeneration, and its modulation has considerable potential as a therapeutic approach. Different  species, including sphingolipids, sterols, and phospholipids play important roles in the various steps of autophagy. In particular, there is accumulating evidence indicating the minor group of phospholipids called the phosphoinositides as key modulators of autophagy, including the signaling processes underlying autophagy initiation, autophagosome biogenesis and maturation. In this review we discuss the known functions to date of the phosphoinositides in autophagy and attempt to summarize the kinases and phosphatases that regulate them as well as the proteins that bind to them throughout the autophagy program. We will also provide examples of how the control of phosphoinositides and their metabolizing enzymes is relevant to understanding many human diseases.© 2019 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694039>Glucose and  Abnormalities among Patients with Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease.</a></h1><p>Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is the most prevalent monogenic renal disease with a prevalence of 1:1,000 births and it is the 4th most common cause of dialysis-dependent end-stage renal disease (ESDR).

Patients with rotator cuff tears often have substantial weakness, fibrosis, and  accumulation which limit successful surgical repair and postoperative rehabilitation. The Murphy Roths Large (MRL) strain of mice have demonstrated superior healing and protection against pathological changes in several disease and injury conditions. We tested the hypothesis that, compared to the commonly used C57Bl/6 (B6) strain, MRL mice would have less muscle fiber atrophy and  accumulation, and be protected against the loss in force production that occurs after cuff tear. Adult male B6 and MRL mice were subjected to a rotator cuff tear, and changes in muscle fiber contractility and histology were measured. RNA sequencing, and shotgun metabolomics and lipidomics were also performed. Muscles were harvested one month after tear. B6 and MRL mice had a 40% reduction in relative muscle force production after rotator cuff tear. RNA sequencing identified an increase in fibrosis-associated genes and a reduction in mitochondrial  genes. Markers of glycolytic  increased in B6 mice, while MRL mice appeared to increase amino acid  after tear. There was an accumulation of  after injury, although there was a divergent response between B6 and MRL mice in the types of  species that accrued. There were strain-specific differences between the transcriptome, metabolome, and lipidome of B6 and MRL mice, but these differences did not protect MRL mice from weakness and pathological changes after rotator cuff tear.

Blood was sampled before and 180 min after completion of each MTT. Subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) was collected after overnight fast and both MTTs. Prior to each investigation day, participants consumed a 4-week isocaloric diet of the same composition: (1) high-carb meals until 13:30 and high- meals between 16:30 and 22:00 or (2) the inverse order.12h-daily  patterns showed a complex regulation by both the time of day (67.8%) and meal composition (55.4%). A third of lipids showed a diurnal variation in postprandial responses to the same meal with mostly higher responses in the morning than in the afternoon. Triacylglycerols containing shorter and more saturated fatty acids were enriched in the morning. SAT transcripts involved in fatty acid synthesis and desaturation showed no diurnal variation. Diurnal changes of seven  classes were negatively associated with insulin sensitivity, but not with glucose and insulin response or insulin secretion.This study identified postprandial plasma  profiles as being strongly affected by meal timing and associated with insulin sensitivity.© Endocrine Society 2019.

However, it remains unclear whether and how suppression of PVAT remodeling could attenuate vascular injury. In this study, we examined the effect of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, luseogliflozin on PVAT remodeling and neointima formation after wire injury in mice.Wilt-type mice fed with low- diet (LFD) or high- diet (HFD) received oral administration of luseogliflozin (18 mg/kg/day) or vehicle. Mice underwent bilateral femoral artery wire injury followed by unilateral removal of surrounding PVAT. After 25 days, injured femoral arteries and surrounding PVAT were analyzed.In LFD-fed lean mice, neither luseogliflozin treatment or PVAT removal attenuated the intima-to-media (I/M) ratio of injured arteries. However, in HFD-fed mice, luseogliflozin or PVAT removal reduced the I/M ratio, whereas their combination showed no additive reduction. In PVAT surrounding injured femoral arteries of HFD-fed mice, luseogliflozin treatment decreased the adipocyte sizes. Furthermore, luseogliflozin reduced accumulation of macrophages expressing platelet-derived growth factor-B (PDGF-B) and increased adiponectin gene expression. Gene expression levels of Pdgf-b in PVAT were correlated with the I/M ratio.Our present study suggests that luseogliflozin could attenuate neointimal hyperplasia after wire injury in HFD-fed mice partly via suppression of macrophage PDGF-B expression in PVAT.

To better understand the integrated molecular physiological effects of adipose H6PDH, we created a tissue-specific knockout of the H6PDH gene mouse model in adipocytes (adipocyte-specific conditional knockout of H6PDH (H6PDHAcKO) mice). H6PDHAcKO mice exhibited almost complete absence of H6PDH expression and decreased intra-adipose corticosterone production with a reduction in 11β-HSD1 activity in adipose tissue. These mice also had decreased abdominal  mass, which was paralleled by decreased adipose lipogenic acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) and ATP-citrate lyase (ACL) gene expression and reduction in their transcription factor C/EBPα mRNA levels. Moreover, H6PDHAcKO mice also had reduced fasting blood glucose levels, increased glucose tolerance, and increased insulin sensitivity. In addition, plasma free fatty acid (FFA) levels were decreased with a concomitant decrease in the expression of lipase adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) and hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) in adipose tissue. These results indicate that inactivation of adipocyte H6PDH expression is sufficient to cause intra-adipose GC inactivation that leads to a favorable pattern of metabolic phenotypes. These data suggest that H6PDHAcKO mice may provide a good model for studying the potential contributions of -specific H6PDH inhibition to improve the metabolic phenotype in vivo. Our study suggests that suppression or inactivation of H6PDH expression in adipocytes could be an effective intervention for treating obesity and diabetes.© 2019 The Author(s).

Pulmonary arterial hypertension and exercise PH share similar physiologic consequences; it is debated whether they share biologic mechanisms and if exercise PH represents an early phase of pulmonary arterial hypertension. We conducted an observational study to test if there is a graded metabolic disturbance along the severity of PH, which may indicate shared or disparate pathophysiology. Individuals referred to an academic medical dyspnea center with unexplained exertional intolerance underwent invasive cardiopulmonary exercise testing. We identified controls with no hemodynamic exercise limitation, individuals with exercise PH (mean pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP) < 25 mmHg at rest but ≥ 30 mmHg during exercise without pulmonary venous hypertension) and pulmonary arterial hypertension (mPAP > 25 mmHg at rest without pulmonary venous hypertension) ( = 26 in each group). Unbiased metabolomics with chromatography mass spectrometry was performed on pulmonary arterial blood at rest and peak exercise. Random forest analysis and hierarchical clustering were used to quantify metabolite prediction of group membership and rank metabolites which were significantly different between groups. Compared to controls, pulmonary arterial hypertension subjects exhibited perturbations in pathways involving glycolysis, TCA cycle, fatty acid and complex  oxidation, collagen deposition and fibrosis, nucleotide , and others. The metabolic signature of exercise PH was uniquely between that of control and pulmonary arterial hypertension subjects. Accuracy predicting control, exercise PH, and pulmonary arterial hypertension group was 96%, 90%, and 88%, respectively, using paired rest-exercise metabolic changes.

Age-related changes to skeletal muscle lead to glucose dysregulation, with consequent reduction in glycaemic control, increased insulin resistance and ultimately onset of type-2 diabetes. Recent studies indicate that high total  and SFA intake are detrimental to skeletal muscle, while higher intakes of PUFA are protective. Age-associated changes in skeletal muscle may also reduce total fatty acid utilisation.In conclusion, further research is needed to understand the relationships between macronutrient  and utilisation and age-related changes to skeletal muscle. No dietary recommendations exist specifically for skeletal muscle health during ageing, but we advise individuals to follow healthy eating guidelines, by consuming sufficient protein, fruit and vegetables, and limited SFA and to maintain physically active lifestyles. Clinicians responsible for managing type-2 diabetes need to be aware of growing evidence relating age-related skeletal muscle changes to diabetes onset and progression.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31698038>Inhaled rapamycin solid  nano particles for the treatment of Lymphangioliomyomatosis.</a></h1><p>Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is a rare lung disease characterized by uncontrolled growth of smooth muscle -like cells in the lungs that can spread via the lymphatic system to other parts of the body. The current treatment for LAM, oral rapamycin, is limited by its low oral bioavailability and side effects. This study aims to develop an inhaled formulation of rapamycin solid  nanoparticles (Rapa-SLNs) to avoid first-pass , increase in-vivo half-life and facilitate entry into the lymphatic system through the lungs. Rapa-SLNs were manufactured using a hot evaporation technique and freeze-dried overnight with 5% (w/v) mannitol and before being assessed further for particle characteristics and in vitro aerosol performance and release. The formulation's ability to penetrate through bronchial epithelial layer was evaluated using a Calu-3 cell model, while its ability to interfere with the LAM intracellular cascade was evaluated using Mouse Embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells deficient for the tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (TSC2) and compared with rapamycin solution. Results showed that the Rapa- SLNs had the appropriate size (237.5 ± 1.8 nm), charge (-11.2), in-vitro aerosol performance (MMAD =5.4 ± 0.4 μm) and sustained release profile suitable for entry into the lymphatic system via the pulmonary route. Additionally, the nanoparticles were transported at a faster rate across the bronchial epithelial layer compared to free rapamycin solution. The formulation also showed similar mTOR (mammalian target of Rapamycin) inhibition properties compared to raw rapamycin, and was able to significantly decrease the amount of proliferation in TSC2 negative MEF cells. This formulation is therefore a promising alternative treatment for LAM patients, as it could potentially reduce problems associated with low bioavailability and side effects of current oral treatment.Copyright © 2019.

The nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor family, pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome is an intracellularly produced macromolecular complex that can trigger pyroptosis and inflammation, and its activation is induced by a variety of signals. ER stress has been found to affect NLRP3 inflammasome activation through multiple effects including the unfolded protein response (UPR), calcium or , and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Intriguingly, the role of ER stress in inflammasome activation has not attracted a great deal of attention. In addition, increasing evidence highlights that both ER stress and NLRP3 inflammasome activation contribute to atherosclerosis (AS). AS is a common cardiovascular disease with complex pathogenesis, and the precise mechanisms behind its pathogenesis remain to be determined. Both ER stress and the NLRP3 inflammasome have emerged as critical individual contributors of AS, and owing to the multiple associations between these two events, we speculate that they contribute to the mechanisms of pathogenesis in AS. In this review, we aim to summarize the molecular mechanisms of ER stress, NLRP3 inflammasome activation, and the cross talk between these two pathways in AS in the hopes of providing new pharmacological targets for AS treatment.Copyright © 2019 Xinnong Chen et al.</p></html>
