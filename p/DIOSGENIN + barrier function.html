<html><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29504766>Synthesis, Characterization, and Solid State Dynamic Studies of a Hydrogen Bond-Hindered Steroidal Molecular Rotor with a Flexible Axis.</a></h2><p>A novel steroid molecular rotor was obtained in four steps from the naturally occurring spirostane sapogenin . The structural and dynamic characterization was carried out by solution NMR, VT X-ray diffraction, solid state C CPMAS, and solid state H NMR experiments. They allowed the identification of a fast dynamic process with a frequency of 14 MHz at room temperature, featuring a  to rotation Ea = 7.87 kcal mol. The gathered experimental evidence indicated the presence of a hydrogen bond that becomes stronger as the temperature lowers. This interaction was characterized using theoretical calculations, based on topological analyses of the electronic density and energies. In addition, combining theoretical calculations with experimental measurements, it was possible to propose a partition to Ea (∼8 kcal/mol) into three contributions, that are the cost of the intrinsic rotation (∼2 kcal/mol), the hydrogen bond interaction (∼2 kcal/mol), and the packing effects (∼2-3 kcal/mol). The findings from the present work highlight the relevance of the individual components in the  of molecular machines in the solid state.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26253490>Advances in the pharmacological activities and mechanisms of .</a></h2><p>, a well-known steroid sapogenin derived from plants, has been used as a starting material for production of steroidal hormones. The present review will summarize published literature concerning pharmacological potential of , and the underlying mechanisms of actions.  has shown a vast range of pharmacological activities in preclinical studies. It exhibits anticancer, cardiovascular protective, anti-diabetes, neuroprotective, immunomodulatory, estrogenic, and skin protective effects, mainly by inducing apoptosis, suppressing malignant transformation, decreasing oxidative stress, preventing inflammatory events, promoting cellular differentiation/proliferation, and regulating T-cell immune response, etc. It interferes with cell death pathways and their regulators to induce apoptosis.  antagonizes tumor metastasis by modulating epithelial-mesenchymal transition and actin cytoskeleton to change cellular motility, suppressing degradation of matrix barrier, and inhibiting angiogenesis. Additionally,  improves antioxidant status and inhibits lipid peroxidation. Its anti-inflammatory activity is through inhibiting production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, enzymes and adhesion molecules. Furthermore,  drives cellular growth/differentiation through the estrogen receptor (ER) cascade and transcriptional factor PPARγ. In summary, these mechanistic studies provide a basis for further development of this compound for pharmacotherapy of various diseases.Copyright © 2015 China Pharmaceutical University.
