A study in knob-hole engineered fibrin.</a></h2><p>The invasion of a matrix by migrating cells is a key step in its remodelling. At least in 2D migration models, cells tend to localize in stiffer areas (durotaxis). Here, we show that mechanical properties affect differently the 3D migration rate: non-proteolytic 3D cell migration is facilitated in softer matrices. In these gels, the modulus was varied by introducing defects in fibres, leaving largely intact the nanostructure. The matrices derive from fibrin via functionalization with a bioinert polymer [poly(ethylene glycol), PEG] through an affinity mechanism identical to that presiding to fibrin own self-assembly. Peptidic end groups on PEG were used to bind fibrinogen globular D regions [GPRP (glycine-proline-arginine-proline) for  holes, GHRP (glycine-histidine-arginine-proline) for  holes; K evaluated via isothermal titration calorimetry or fluorescence anisotropy]. In a dose-dependent manner, both PEGylated peptides decreased gel stiffness, but most other properties at a macroscopic [e.g., overall elastic character, strain hardening, and high (>0.5) Poisson ratio] or nano/micro level (fibre dimension and pore size) were largely unaffected, suggesting that the softening effect was due to the introduction of defects within fibres, rather than to differences in the network architecture. In these matrices, the key determinant of fibroblast migration was found to be the elastic modulus, rather than the identity or the dose of the PEGylated peptide; softer materials allowed a faster invasion, even if this meant a higher content of non-adhesive PEG. This does not conflict with fibroblast durotaxis (where stiffness controls accumulation but not necessarily the speed of migration) and indicates a way to fine tune the speed of cell .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31136624>Genomic analysis of Neisseria meningitidis carriage isolates during an outbreak of serogroup C clonal complex 11, Tuscany, Italy.</a></h2><p>In 2015-2016, a cross-sectional carriage survey was performed in Tuscany Region, Italy, during an outbreak of invasive meningococcal disease due to Neisseria meningitidis serogroup C clonal complex 11 (MenC:cc11). This study aims to evaluate the genomic profile of meningococcal carriage isolates collected during the survey.Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) was performed using Illumina MiSeq on 85 cultivated meningococcal carriage isolates received at the Dept. of Infectious Disease, National Institute of Health (Istituto Superiore di Sanità, ISS), as National Reference Laboratory (NRL) for Invasive Meningococcal Disease (IMD). De novo assembled genomes were scanned by the BIGSdb platform to assign: the genotypic profiles, the cgMLST, the vaccine antigen variants and allele types of antimicrobial resistance associated genes, together with denitrification pathway loci.Capsule null and non-groupable meningococci accounted for 52.9% and 10.6%, respectively. Among the remaining carriage isolates, serogroup  was the predominant (71.0%). Serogroup C meningococci were culture negative and unavailable for WGS. Overall, 64 genotypic profiles were identified and, based on cgMLST, isolates clustered according to clonal complexes. Eight isolates (9.4%) harbored at least one gene encoding a 4CMenB vaccine antigen. Mutated penA alleles were found in more than 82%. Finally, complete aniA and norB coding sequences were detected among 71.8% of carriage isolates.Meningococcal carriage isolates collected during the MenC:cc11 outbreak were characterized by an extensive genetic diversity. The lack of outbreak-related isolates among carriage might be attributable to the high transmissibility with low duration of  of MenC:cc11 meningococci.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31626718>Group  Streptococcus serotypes Ia and V induce differential vaginal immune responses that may contribute to long term  of the female reproductive tract.</a></h2><p>Group  Streptococcus (GBS) is a common colonizer of the female genital tract at the time of pregnancy, and has been associated with severe neonatal infections. Despite trials for GBS vaccines already being underway, the factors influencing vaginal GBS  and clearance are currently poorly understood.Within this study, we investigated the host immune responses to GBS infections in mice that affect GBS vaginal  and clearance. Cervicovaginal swabs were used to measure vaginal GBS persistence, and vaginal cytokine responses were measured using the Bio-Plex® system. Lymphocytes isolated from spleens were stimulated with UV-killed GBS to examine systemic cellular responses. Additional in vitro cellular experiments using human vaginal epithelial cells were also performed, examining the effect pregnancy level hormones had on GBS adhesion, invasion and cytokine responses.We observed significant differences in the ability of GBS serotype V infections to persist, compared to GBS serotype Ia vaginal infections. Vaginal cytokine response examination identified temporal changes in cytokine production (IL10, IFNγ, IL6, IL1β, TNFα) in relation to GBS serotype and clearance or . Lymphocyte proliferation assays also revealed robust cellular immune responses to GBS vaginal infections irrespective of clearance or . In vitro human cellular analyses also identified that vaginal epithelial cell line cytokine production was suppressed in the presence of hormones despite no alteration in adhesion/invasion.Here, we establish previously unknown, serotype specific, temporal immune responses which may be associated with vaginal GBS  or clearance in the female genital tract.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Analysis of correlation networks between soil fungi and plants suggests that the reduced effect of pH in the sod treatment, where both soil and plant propagules were added, might be due to plant-fungal interactions since the sod additions caused stronger, more specific, and more consistent connections compared to no addition treatment. •Based on these results, we suggest that the initial availability of heathland fungal and plant taxa, that reinforce each other, can significantly steer further fungal community development to an alternative configuration, overriding otherwise prominent effect of abiotic (pH) conditions.© 2019 The Authors New Phytologist © 2019 New Phytologist Trust.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31364050>Whole-Genome Phage Display Libraries: A Powerful Tool for Antigen Discovery.</a></h2><p>In the last two decades, phage display technology has been used for investigating complex biological processes and isolating molecules of practical value in several applications.

We aimed to develop a GBS digital PCR (GBS-dPCR) assay for detecting GBS . More rapid and accurate detection of GBS  could increase GBS diagnosis and treatment closer to delivery. A single-center, retrospective, case-controlled study was performed. A total of 182 rectovaginal swabs from pregnant women, who were undergoing prenatal screening by broth-enriched culture, were evaluated using GBS-dPCR targeting the  gene of GBS. Pregnant women with GBS  were followed up for correlation analysis between GBS DNA copy numbers and perinatal outcomes. The results of the GBS-dPCR assay were compared to those from the broth-enriched culture, which is the gold standard for GBS detection. The sensitivity and specificity of GBS-dPCR were 98% and 92.5%, respectively. By discrepant result analysis, the specificity of GBS-dPCR was raised to 97.4%. The incidence of premature rupture of membrane (PROM) and neonatal infection were statistically significantly positively correlated with GBS DNA copy numbers. GBSdPCR has the advantage of directly detecting GBS  from swabs with high specificity and sensitivity, while reducing turnaround time (<4 h). Analysis of clinical samples with GBS-dPCR shows that GBS DNA copy numbers are positively correlated with the incidence of PROM and neonatal infection, suggesting that dPCR is a promising method for detection of GBS  during pregnancy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31370804>Fecal carriage and molecular epidemiology of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae from outpatient children in Shanghai.</a></h2><p>Fecal  with carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) is a risk factor for bacterial translocation resulting in subsequent endogenous infections. The purpose of this study is to investigate the prevalence of CRE strains  in stool samples of outpatient in a tertiary pediatric hospital of Shanghai, China.In a retrospective study, fecal samples were consecutively obtained from patients in 2016 and screening test for CRE was conducted by using home-made MacConkey agar. Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined by the broth microdilution method and β-lactamases were characterized by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays and DNA sequencing. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) was performed for the genetic relationships of the isolates.A total of 880 fecal samples were included for this screening test and 32 CRE strains were identified in 32 non-duplicate fecal samples from 32 children (1.3 ± 1.5 years), with a carriage rate of 3.6%. These strains mainly distributed in Klebsiella pnuemoniae (37.5%) and Escherichia coli (37.5%). All CRE strains showed high resistance to most of the routinely used antibiotics (> 90%) except for polymyxin  and tigecycline. The bla gene was the major carbapenemase gene harbored by gastrointestinal CRE strains, followed by bla, bla, and bla. Other β-Lactamase genes including bla, bla, bla, and bla were also detected. MLST analysis revealed that various sequence types (STs) were detected in these strains, with ST11 and ST37 being more prevalent in K.pneumoniae and ST101 in E.coli.This study revealed the prevalence of CRE fecal carriage in children from outpatient and urgent implementation of infection control measure should be conducted to limit the spread of CRE strains.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31402749>Bulk phase resource ratio alters carbon steel corrosion rates and endogenously produced extracellular electron transfer mediators in a sulfate-reducing biofilm.</a></h2><p> G20 biofilms were cultivated on 316 steel, 1018 steel, or borosilicate glass under steady-state conditions in electron-acceptor limiting (EAL) and electron-donor limiting (EDL) conditions with lactate and sulfate in a defined medium. Increased corrosion was observed on 1018 steel under EDL conditions compared to 316 steel, and biofilms on 1018 carbon steel under the EDL condition had at least twofold higher corrosion rates compared to the EAL condition. Protecting the 1018 metal coupon from biofilm  significantly reduced corrosion, suggesting that the corrosion mechanism was enhanced through attachment between the material and the biofilm.

Adaptability to these stresses involves survival and  of bacteria, thus contributing to bacterial contamination in food. UFAs are synthesized by FabAB- and Des-mediated pathways in . Therefore, in this study, the roles of UFA-synthesizing proteins of  in resistance to stresses were examined. The growth and transcription levels of wild-type (WT)  PAO1 and its mutants were compared. The growth of all strains was inhibited by exposure to 0.5 or 1.0 M sodium chloride, but it was not affected by oxidative or pH stress. In particular, growth was impaired more substantially in the  mutant than in the WT strain and other mutants, suggesting that DesB has a role in response to salt stress. A comparative transcriptional analysis showed that genes involved in the synthesis of osmoprotectants (trehalose, -acetylglutaminylglutamine amide, and hydrophilin) were highly expressed in WT  in response to high salt, but they were rarely expressed in the  mutant. Furthermore, decreases in osmoprotectant production by the  mutant were partially complemented by the addition of betaine. These results indicate that  DesB contributes to adaptation to high salinity by positively regulating the synthesis of osmoprotectants.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31131028>Immunopathological properties of the  flagellins and the adhesin CadF as assessed in a clinical murine infection model.</a></h2><p> infections constitute serious threats to human health with increasing prevalences worldwide. Our knowledge regarding the molecular mechanisms underlying host-pathogen interactions is still limited. Our group has established a clinical  infection model based on abiotic IL-10 mice mimicking key features of human campylobacteriosis. In order to further validate this model for unraveling pathogen-host interactions mounting in acute disease, we here surveyed the immunopathological features of the important  virulence factors FlaA and FlaB and the major adhesin CadF ( adhesin to fibronectin), which play a role in bacterial motility, protein secretion and adhesion, respectively.Therefore, abiotic IL-10 mice were perorally infected with  strain 81-176 (WT) or with its isogenic  (Δ) or  (Δ) deletion mutants. Cultural analyses revealed that WT and Δ but not Δ bacteria stably colonized the stomach, duodenum and ileum, whereas all three strains were present in the colon at comparably high loads on day 6 post-infection. Remarkably, despite high colonic  densities, murine infection with the Δ strain did not result in overt campylobacteriosis, whereas mice infected with Δ or WT were suffering from acute enterocolitis at day 6 post-infection. These symptoms coincided with pronounced pro-inflammatory immune responses, not only in the intestinal tract, but also in other organs such as the liver and kidneys and were accompanied with systemic inflammatory responses as indicated by increased serum MCP-1 concentrations following  Δ or WT, but not Δ strain infection.For the first time, our observations revealed that the  flagellins A/, but not adhesion mediated by CadF, are essential for inducing murine campylobacteriosis. Furthermore, the secondary abiotic IL-10 infection model has been proven suitable not only for detailed investigations of immunological aspects of campylobacteriosis, but also for differential analyses of the roles of distinct  virulence factors in induction and progression of disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31341563>Molecular analysis and antimicrobial resistance pattern of distinct strains of  isolated from cystic fibrosis patients in Iran.</a></h2><p> of  in Cystic Fibrosis (CF) patients may lead to severe pulmonary disease and death.

Diagnostic modalities such as toxigenic culture and nucleic acid amplification testing can identify the presence of toxigenic C difficile in stools. But these tests are confounded by the presence of asymptomatic  of toxigenic C difficile and lead to overdiagnosis of CDI. The presence of two large toxins, toxin A and  (TcdA and TcdB) is necessary for pathogenicity. Detection of toxins using toxin enzyme immunoassay is difficult as it has low sensitivity and moderate specificity. Raman spectroscopy (RS) is a novel technology that is used to detect bacteria and their toxins. RS does not require any reagents for detection such as antibodies, enzymes, primers, or stains. We hypothesize that RS is a sensitive method to detect C difficile toxins in stool and will solve the problem of overdiagnosis of CDI.CDI negative stool samples were spiked with concentrations (1 ng/mL, 100 pg/mL, 1 pg/mL, and 0.1 pg/mL) of TcdA and TcdB. RS was performed on air-dried smeared samples of stool supernatant on a mirror-polished stainless-steel slide. As RS of feces is difficult because of confounding background material and autofluorescence, samples were photo-bleached before spectral acquisition to reduce autofluorescence. Raman spectra were obtained, background corrected, and vector normalized. The data were split into training (70%) and test (30%) datasets. The machine learning methods used on the training data set were Support Vector Machine with Linear and Radial Kernels, Random Forest, Stochastic Gradient Boosting Machine, and Principle Component Analysis-Linear Discriminant Analysis. Results were validated using a test data set. The best model was chosen, and its accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were determined.In our preliminary results, at all concentrations (1 ng/mL, 100 pg/mL, 1 pg/mL, and 0.1 pg/mL), TcdA or TcdB spiked stool was distinguished from unspiked stool by all models with accuracies ranging from 64% to 77%. Gradient Boosting Machine, Principle Component Analysis-Linear Discriminant Analysis, and Support Vector Machine Linear Kernel performed best with sensitivities ranging from 69% to 90% and specificities ranging from 43% to 78%.Using RS, we successfully detected TcdA and TcdB in stool samples albeit with moderate-to-high sensitivity and low-to-moderate specificity. Sensitivity and specificity could be further increased with the implementation of deep learning methods, which require large sample sizes. In terms of sensitivity, RS performs better than toxin enzyme immunoassay and has the potential to rapidly detect C difficile toxins in stool at clinically relevant concentrations and thereby help mitigate overdiagnosis of CDI.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

We conducted this study to assess the effects of maternal obesity on maternal and perinatal outcomes. Methods A historical cohort study was performed on 16,609 women who delivered singleton babies in a 5-year period (2013-2017). Data were retrieved from the Cruces Perinatal Database (CPD) and only women whose prepregnancy body mass index (BMI) was known were included. Women were categorized according to the World Health Organization (WHO) classification: normal weight (BMI 20-24.9 kg/m2) and obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2). Obstetric, perinatal and neonatal outcomes were compared, and adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated using the normal-weight group as the reference. Results Compared to women of normal weight (n = 9778), obese women (n = 2207) had a higher risk of preeclampsia (aOR 2.199, 95% CI: 1.46-3.29), rectovaginal group  streptococcus  (aOR 1.299, 95% CI: 1.14-1.47), induction of labor (aOR 1.593, 95% CI: 1.44-1.75), cesarean section (aOR 2.755, 95% CI: 2.46-3.08), cesarean section in women with a history of cesarean delivery (aOR 1.409, 95% CI: 1.03-1.92), fetal weight ≥4000 g (aOR 2.090, 95% CI: 1.803-2.422) and admission to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) (aOR 1.341, 95% CI: 1.12-1.59).

It also aims at finding possible correlations between VVC and vaginal  by other agents, such as Group   (GBS) and bacterial vaginosis.Over a one-year period, high vaginal swabs were collected from pregnant women during their regular antenatal checkup in different polyclinics in Beirut and South Lebanon. Swabs were examined microscopically, cultured on Sabouraud Dextrose Agar, and  isolates were identified using Chromatic  medium and Germ Tube Test.VVC was detected in 44.8% of samples, with  (44.4%) and  (43.4%) being the most isolated species. Approximately, half of pregnant women (57.7%) were coinfected with  and bacterial vaginosis, while 26% of them carried simultaneously  spp. and GBS. No significant correlation was found between the occurrence of VVC and demographic, clinical, medical, and reproductive health characteristics of pregnant women. In contrast, participants with previous miscarriages and those being hospitalized during the past 12 months were more susceptible to develop vaginal  infection in comparison to other  species (p=0.0316 and p=0.0042, respectively).The prevalence of VVC in pregnant women is an increasing trend in our community.

Although GBS is known to exhibit vast diversity in virulence across strains, the mechanisms of GBS-associated pathogenesis are incompletely understood. We hypothesized that GBS strains of different genotypes would vary in their ability to elicit host inflammatory responses, and that strains associated with neonatal disease would induce different cytokine profiles than those associated with . Using a multiplexed, antibody-based protein detection array, we found that production of a discrete number of inflammatory mediators by THP-1 macrophage-like cells was universally induced in response to challenge with each of five genetically distinct GBS isolates, while other responses appeared to be strain-specific. Key array responses were validated by ELISA using the initial five strains as well as ten additional strains with distinct genotypic and phenotypic characteristics. Interestingly, IL-6 was significantly elevated following infection with neonatal infection-associated sequence type (ST)-17 strains and among strains possessing capsule (cps) type III. Significant differences in production of IL1-β, IL-10 and MCP-2 were also identified across STs and cps types. These data support our hypothesis and suggest that unique host innate immune responses reflect strain-specific differences in virulence across GBS isolates.

For birds, considering temporal scale by averaging drought-related variables over different time lengths (i.e., temporal grains) captures different hydrologic attributes which may uniquely influence food supplies, vegetation greenness/structure, and other factors affecting populations. However, studies examining drought impacts on birds often assess a single temporal grain without considering that different species have different life histories that likely determine the temporal grain of their drought response. Furthermore, while drought is known to influence bird abundance and drive between-year range shifts, less understood is whether it causes within-range changes in species distributions. Our objectives were to (a) determine which temporal grain of drought (if any) is most related to bird presence/absence and whether this response is species specific; and () assess whether drought alters bird distributions by quantifying probability of local  and extinction as a function of drought intensity. We used North American Breeding Bird Survey data collected over 16 years, generalized linear mixed models, and dynamic occupancy models to meet these objectives. Different bird species responded to drought at different temporal grains, with most showing the strongest signal at annual or near-annual grains. For all drought-responsive species, increased drought intensity at any temporal grain always correlated with decreased occupancy. Additionally, /extinction analyses indicated that one species, the dickcissel (Spiza americana), is more likely to colonize novel areas within the southern/core portion of its range during drought. Considering drought at different temporal grains, along with hydrologic attributes captured by each grain, may better reveal mechanisms behind drought impacts on birds and other organisms, and therefore improve understanding of how global climate change impacts species and the landscapes they inhabit.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31411526>Prevention of enteric bacterial infections and modulation of gut microbiota with conjugated linoleic acids producing  in mice.</a></h2><p>Probiotics are recognized for outcompeting pathogenic bacteria by competitive receptor-mediated  and secretion of functional metabolites which are antimicrobial against certain microbes as well as improving host's gut health and immunity. Recently, we have constructed a bioactive  (LC) strain, LC, by inserting  (myosin cross-reactive antigen) gene, which stimulates the conversion of conjugated linoleic acids. In this study, we evaluated the modulation of gut microbiome and protective roles of LC against pathogenic  serovar Typhimurium (ST) and enterohemorrhagic  (EHEC) infections in BALB/cJ mice. We observed that LC colonized efficiently in mice gut intestine and competitively reduced the infection with ST and EHEC in various locations of small and large intestine, specifically cecum, jejunum, and ileum ( < 0.05). Positive modulation of the cecal microbiota, for example, higher relative abundances of Firmicutes, lower relative abundances of Proteobacteria, and increased bacterial species diversity/richness, was detected in ST-challenged mice pretreated with LC based on 16S metagenomic sequencing. Cytokine gene expression analysis indicated that mice pretreated with LC associated with attenuated bacterial pathogen-induced gut inflammation. Furthermore, mice fed daily with LC for one week could protect themselves from the impairments caused by enteric infections with ST or EHEC. These impairments include weight loss, negative hematological changes, intestinal histological alterations, and potential death. This  study suggests that daily consumption of novel conjugated linoleic acids over-producing probiotic effectively improves intestinal microbiota composition and prevents/combats foodborne enteric bacterial infections with pathogenic  and diarrheagenic .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31541488>Molecular tagging of biocontrol fungus Trichoderma asperellum and its  in soil.</a></h2><p>To conduct molecular tagging of the biocontrol fungus Trichoderma asperellum strain T and elucidate its  patterns in soil.We constructed an expression vector harbouring a hygromycin -resistant gene (hph) and an efficient green fluorescent protein (egfp) gene.

In the second stage, we monitored the impact of the probiotic Bifidobacterium lactis V9 on the intestinal microbiome, gut-brain mediators, and sex hormones of 14 PCOS patients. Notably, we observed that the levels of luteinizing hormone (LH) and LH/follicle-stimulating hormone (LH/FSH) decreased significantly in 9 volunteers, whereas the levels of sex hormones and intestinal short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) increased markedly. In contrast, the changes in the indices mentioned above were indistinct in the remaining 5 volunteers. The results of an analysis of the number of viable Bifidobacterium lactis V9 cells in the two groups were highly consistent with the clinical and SCFA results. Therefore, effective host gut  of the probiotic Bifidobacterium lactis V9 was crucial for its ability to function as a probiotic. Finally, we propose a potential mechanism describing how probiotics regulate the levels of sex hormones by manipulating the intestinal microbiome in PCOS patients.  Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common metabolic disorder among women of reproductive age worldwide. Through a two-phase clinical experiment, we first revealed an imbalance in the intestinal microbiome of PCOS patients. By binning and annotating shotgun metagenomic sequences into metagenomic species (MGS), 61 MGSs were identified as potential PCOS-related microbial biomarkers. In the second stage, we monitored the impact of the probiotic Bifidobacterium lactis V9 on the intestinal microbiota, metabolic parameters, gut-brain mediators, and sex hormones of PCOS patients. Notably, we observed that the PCOS-related clinical indices and the intestinal microbiotas of the participating patients exhibited an inconsistent response to the intake of the . lactis V9 probiotic.

Using the model mutualism between the marine bacterium Vibrio fischeri and the Hawaiian bobtail squid, we characterized the bacterial transcriptional response to acidic pH experienced during the shift from planktonic to host-associated lifestyles. We found several genes involved in outer membrane structure were differentially expressed based on pH, indicating alterations in membrane physiology as V. fischeri initiates its symbiotic program. Exposure to host-like pH increased the resistance of V. fischeri to the cationic antimicrobial peptide polymixin , which resembles antibacterial molecules that are produced by the squid to select V. fischeri from the ocean microbiota. Using a forward genetic screen, we identified a homolog of eptA, a predicted phosphoethanolamine transferase, as critical for antimicrobial defense. We used MALDI-MS to verify eptA as an ethanolamine transferase for the lipid-A portion of V. fischeri lipopolysaccharide. We then used a DNA pulldown approach to discover that eptA transcription is activated by the global regulator H-NS. Finally, we revealed that eptA promotes successful squid  by V. fischeri, supporting its potential role in initiation of this highly specific symbiosis.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31443102> by . infantis EVC001 modulates enteric inflammation in exclusively breastfed infants.</a></h2><p>Infant gut dysbiosis, often associated with low abundance of bifidobacteria, is linked to impaired immune development and inflammation-a risk factor for increased incidence of several childhood diseases.

The primary risk factor for neonatal GBS early-onset disease (EOD) is maternal  of the genitourinary and gastrointestinal tracts. Approximately 50% of women who are colonized with GBS will transmit the bacteria to their newborns. Vertical transmission usually occurs during labor or after rupture of membranes. In the absence of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis, 1-2% of those newborns will develop GBS EOD. Other risk factors include gestational age of less than 37 weeks, very low birth weight, prolonged rupture of membranes, intraamniotic infection, young maternal age, and maternal black race. The key obstetric measures necessary for effective prevention of GBS EOD continue to include universal prenatal screening by vaginal-rectal culture, correct specimen collection and processing, appropriate implementation of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis, and coordination with pediatric care providers. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists now recommends performing universal GBS screening between 36 0/7 and 37 6/7 weeks of gestation. All women whose vaginal-rectal cultures at 36 0/7-37 6/7 weeks of gestation are positive for GBS should receive appropriate intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis unless a prelabor cesarean birth is performed in the setting of intact membranes. Although a shorter duration of recommended intrapartum antibiotics is less effective than 4 or more hours of prophylaxis, 2 hours of antibiotic exposure has been shown to reduce GBS vaginal colony counts and decrease the frequency of a clinical neonatal sepsis diagnosis. Obstetric interventions, when necessary, should not be delayed solely to provide 4 hours of antibiotic administration before birth.

At low frequency, the infection can spread to the blood, resulting in life-threatening sepsis known as puerperal sepsis. Pathogens causing puerperal sepsis include group A Streptococcus (GAS), and epidemiological analyses have identified isolates of a single serotype, M28, as being nonrandomly associated with cases of puerperal sepsis. The genomes of serotype M28 GAS isolates harbor a 36.3-kb mobile genetic element of apparent group  Streptococcus origin, termed region of difference 2 (RD2).The phenotypic (determined via tissue culture and a vaginal  model) and regulatory (determined via RNA sequencing analysis) contributions of RD2 were assessed by comparing parental, RD2 deletion mutant, and complemented mutant serotype M28 GAS strains.RD2 affords serotype M28 isolates an enhanced ability to adhere to human vaginal epithelial cells and to colonize the female reproductive tract in a mouse model of infection. In addition, RD2 influences the abundance of messenger RNAs from >100 core chromosomal GAS genes.The data are consistent with RD2 directly, via encoded virulence factors, and indirectly, via encoded regulatory proteins, modifying the virulence potential of GAS and contributing to the decades-old association of serotype M28 isolates with cases of puerperal sepsis.© The Author(s) 2019.

Everyone who is colonized with these pathogenic bacteria can develop gastric inflammation, termed gastritis. Additionally, a small proportion of colonized people develop more adverse outcomes, including gastric ulcer disease, gastric adenocarcinoma, or gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma. The development of these adverse outcomes is dependent on the establishment of a chronic inflammatory response. The development and control of this chronic inflammatory response are significantly impacted by CD4 T helper cell activity. Noteworthy, T helper 17 (Th17) cells, a proinflammatory subset of CD4 T cells, produce several proinflammatory cytokines that activate innate immune cell antimicrobial activity, drive a pathogenic immune response, regulate  cell responses, and participate in wound healing.

Perfusion bioreactors are attracting growing attention as an effective, modern tool in tissue engineering. A natural biomaterial extensively used in regenerative medicine with outstanding biocompatibility, biodegradability and non-toxic characteristics, is collagen, a structural protein with undisputed beneficial characteristics. This is a study designed according to the above considerations. 3D printed polycaprolactone (PCL) scaffolds with rectangular pores were coated with collagen either as a coating on the scaffold's trabeculae, or as a gel-cell solution penetrating scaffolds' pores. We employed histological, molecular and imaging techniques to analyze , proliferation and chondrogenic differentiation of Adipose Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells (ADMSCs). Two different differentiation culture media were employed to test chondrogenic differentiation on gelated and non gelated PCL scaffolds in static and in perfusion bioreactors dynamic culture conditions. In dynamic culture, non gelated scaffolds combined with our in house TGF-β based medium, augmented chondrogenic differentiation performance, which overall was significantly less favorable compared to StemPro™ propriety medium. The beneficial mechanical stimulus of dynamic culture, appears to outgrow the disadvantage of the "weaker" TGF-β medium used for chondrogenic differentiation. Even though cells in static culture grew well on the scaffold, there was limited penetration inside the construct, so the purpose of the 3D culture was not fully served. In contrast dynamic culture achieved better penetration and uniform distribution of the cells within the scaffold.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier .V.

The prevalence of group  streptococcus at onset of labor was 17.8% (114/642), with 62 women positive for group  streptococcus in both the vagina and rectum, 12 in the vagina only and 40 in rectum only. Intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis was administered correctly in 31.6% (36/114) of GBS positive women at time of delivery and 78.8% (134/170) of women who received antibiotics were actually GBS negative.

This is because, unless models impose reductions in carrying capacity at species' edges, the dominant effect of gene flow is to increase genetic variance and adaptive potential rather than swamping local adaptation. This allows the population to match even very steep changes in trait optima. We extend our previous simulations to explore two nonlinear models of ecological gradients: (a) a sigmoid (steepening) gradient and () a linear gradient with a flat centre of variable width. We compare the parameter conditions that allow local adaptation and range expansion from the centre, with those that permit the persistence of a perfectly adapted population distributed across the entire range. Along nonlinear gradients,  is easier, and extinction rarer, than along a linear gradient. This is because the shallow environmental gradient near the range centre does not cause gene flow to increase genetic variation, and so does not result in reduced population density. However, as gradient steepness increases, gene flow inflates genetic variance and reduces local population density sufficiently that genetic drift overcomes local selection, creating a finite range margin. When a flat centre is superimposed on a linear gradient, gene flow increases genetic variation dramatically at its edges, leading to an abrupt reduction in density that prevents niche expansion. Remarkably local interruptions in a linear ecological gradient (of a width much less than the mean dispersal distance) can prevent local adaptation beyond this flat centre. In contrast to other situations, this effect is stronger and more consistent where carrying capacity is high. Practically speaking, this means that habitat improvement at patch margins will make evolutionary rescue more likely. By contrast, even small improvements in habitat at patch centres may confine populations to limited areas of ecological space.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31355114>Effectiveness of  PDSLzg-1, an innovative Hydrocarbon-Degrading Bacterium conferring antifungal and plant growth-promoting function.</a></h2><p>Genome of the hydrocarbon-degrading bacterium  PDSLzg-1 was analyzed.

Biochar signficantly increased nutrients absorption and plant biomass production with P-fertilization and microbial inoculantion. Texturally different soils enhanced the plant biomass and nutrients absorption in their independent capacity on addition of biochar, microbial inoculants and P-fertilization. It was shown that mycorrhizal inoculation had positive influence on plant root and shoot biomass in both soils irrespective to the biochar type used. Root  was notably increased in biochar + mycorrhizae ( + M) inocultaed plants. It was shown that mycorrhizal inoculation had positive influence on nutrients absorption by plant roots and it had high content of P, potassium, calcium and magnesium in plants at all biochar and P levels.

The purpose of this study was firstly to determine the prevalence of pneumococcus carriage in a population of febrile infants in Marrakesh and secondly, to investigate the risk factors for carriage and the distribution of circulating serotypes.This prospective study was conducted from February to June 2017, in the pediatric emergency department of the Mother and Child Hospital of Mohammed VI University Hospital Centre (UHC) in Marrakesh. At total of 183febrile infants, aged 2-18months, were enrolled in this study and were swabbed for nasopharyngeal carriage. Pneumococci were cultured, identified, serotyped, and tested for penicillin susceptibility. Demographic data and risk factors for carriage were collected. The statistical analyses performed were the following: the analysis of the risk factors using logistic regression, the estimation of serotype diversity with the Simpson index, and the Chi test to compare serotype distribution in the prevaccination (a cohort of 660 healthy children, less than 2years old, in the Marrakesh region, in 2008-2009) and postvaccination periods.The prevalence of Streptococcus pneumoniae carriage was 68.3%.

In total, vaccine serotypes accounted for 6.4% (n=8): 19F (n=2), 1 (n=2) and one strain for each of the following serotypes: 14, 23F, 6B, and 9V. Non-vaccine and nontypeable strains presented 63.2% and 23.2%, respectively, with dominance of serotypes 6A (6.4%), 15A/15F (5.6%), 20, 22F/22A, 23B, and 11A/11D with a prevalence of 3.2%. The rate of pneumococcus strains with reduced susceptibility to penicillin was 33.6%, of which 90.2% were non-vaccine serotypes and nontypeable strains. Serotype diversity increased in the postvaccination period and the effectiveness of PCV-10 against vaccine serotypes was estimated at 89.6%.An important change in the distribution of vaccine and non-vaccine serotypes was observed after the introduction of the PCVs. In fact, the prevalence of vaccine serotypes decreased significantly while non-vaccine serotypes emerged.

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-transformed  cells are killed by viral latency antigen-specific CD8 T cells , but attempts to block  cell infection with antibody or to prime anti-viral CD8 T cells have protected poorly . The Doherty laboratory used Murid Herpesvirus-4 (MuHV-4) to analyze -herpesvirus control in mice and found CD4 T cell dependence, with viral evasion limiting CD8 T cell function. MuHV-4 colonizes germinal center (GC)  cells via lytic transfer from myeloid cells, and CD4 T cells control myeloid infection. GC  and protective, lytic antigen-specific CD4 T cells are now evident also for EBV. Subunit vaccines have protected only transiently against MuHV-4, but whole virus vaccines give long-term protection, via CD4 T cells and antibody. They block infection transfer to  cells, and need include no known viral latency gene, nor any MuHV-4-specific gene. Thus, the Doherty approach of  murine analysis has led to a plausible vaccine strategy for EBV and, perhaps, some insight into what CD8 T cells really do.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31333656>Reactivating Immunity Primed by Acellular Pertussis Vaccines in the Absence of Circulating Antibodies: Enhanced Bacterial Control by TLR9 Rather Than TLR4 Agonist-Including Formulation.</a></h2><p>Pertussis is still observed in many countries despite of high vaccine coverage. Acellular pertussis (aP) vaccination is widely implemented in many countries as primary series in infants and as boosters in school-entry/adolescents/adults (including pregnant women in some). One novel strategy to improve the reactivation of aP-vaccine primed immunity could be to include genetically- detoxified pertussis toxin and novel adjuvants in aP vaccine boosters. Their preclinical evaluation is not straightforward, as it requires mimicking the human situation where T and  memory cells may persist longer than vaccine-induced circulating antibodies. Toward this objective, we developed a novel murine model including two consecutive adoptive transfers of the memory cells induced by priming and boosting, respectively. Using this model, we assessed the capacity of three novel aP vaccine candidates including genetically-detoxified pertussis toxin, pertactin, filamentous hemagglutinin, and fimbriae adsorbed to aluminum hydroxide, supplemented-or not-with Toll-Like-Receptor 4 or 9 agonists (TLR4A, TLR9A), to reactivate aP vaccine-induced immune memory and protection, reflected by bacterial clearance. In the conventional murine immunization model, TLR4A- and TLR9A-containing aP formulations induced similar aP-specific IgG antibody responses and protection against bacterial lung  as current aP vaccines, despite IL-5 down-modulation by both TLR4A and TLR9A and IL-17 up-modulation by TLR4A. In the absence of serum antibodies at time of boosting or exposure, TLR4A- and TLR9A-containing formulations both enhanced vaccine antibody recall compared to current aP formulations. Unexpectedly, however, protection was only increased by the TLR9A-containing vaccine, through both earlier bacterial control and accelerated clearance. This suggests that TLR9A-containing aP vaccines may better reactivate aP vaccine-primed pertussis memory and enhance protection than current or TLR4A-adjuvanted aP vaccines.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31120321>Immunoinformatics Approach to Design a Novel Epitope-Based Oral Vaccine Against .</a></h2><p> is an infectious agent that colonizes the gastric mucosa of half of the population worldwide. This bacterium has been recognized as belonging to group 1 carcinogen by the World Health Organization for the role in development of gastritis, peptic ulcers, and cancer. Due to the increase in resistance to antibiotics used in the anti- therapy, the development of an effective vaccine is an alternative of great interest, which remains a challenge. Therefore, a rational, strategic, and efficient vaccine design against  is necessary where the use of the most current bioinformatics tools could help achieve it. In this study, immunoinformatics approach was used to design a novel multiepitope oral vaccine against . Our multiepitope vaccine is composed of cholera toxin subunit  (CTB) that is used as a mucosal adjuvant to enhance vaccine immunogenicity for oral immunization. CTB fused to 11 epitopes predicted of pathogenic (UreB, VacA, CagA, GGT, NapA, and OipA) and  (HpaA, FlaA, FecA, BabA, and SabA) proteins from . CKS9 peptide (CKSTHPLSC) targets epithelial microfold cells to enhance vaccine uptake from the gut barrier. All sequences were joined to each other by proper linkers. The vaccine was modeled and validated to achieve a high-quality three-dimensional structure. The vaccine design was evaluated as nonallergenic, antigenic, soluble, and with an appropriate molecular weight and isoelectric point. Our results suggest that our newly designed vaccine could serve as a promising anti- vaccine candidate.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31632218>Inhibitory Abilities of  Isolates and Their Culture Filtrates against the Gray Mold Caused by  on Postharvest Fruit.</a></h2><p>, a major phytopathogenic fungus, has been reported to infect more than 200 crop species worldwide, and it causes massive losses in yield. The aim of this study was to evaluate the inhibitory abilities and effects of  RS-25,  MG-4,  Z-14, and  Pnf-4 and their culture filtrates and extracts against the gray mold caused by  on postharvest tomato, strawberry, and grapefruit. The results revealed that the cells of Z-14, culture filtrate of RS-25, and cells of Z-14 showed the strongest biocontrol activity against the gray mold on the strawberry, grape, and tomato fruit, respectively. All the strains produced volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and the VOCs of Pnf-4 displayed the highest inhibition values. Based on headspace solid-phase microextraction in combination with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, esters accounted for the largest percentage of the VOCs produced by RS-25, MG-4, Z-14, and Pnf-4 (36.80%, 29.58%, 30.78%, and 36.26%, respectively). All the strains showed potent cellulase and protease activities, but no chitinase activity. RS-25, Z-14, and MG-4, but not Pnf-4, grew on chrome azurol S agar, and an orange halo was formed around the colonies. All the strains showed biofilm formation, fruit , and lipopeptide production, which may be the main modes of action of the antagonists against  on the fruit.

However, the transmission of CRE between humans and animals has not yet been well studied.We investigated the prevalence, risk factors, and drivers of CRE transmission between humans and their backyard animals in rural China.We conducted a comprehensive sampling strategy in 12 villages in Shandong, China. Using the household [residents and their backyard animals (farm and companion animals)] as a single surveillance unit, we assessed the prevalence of CRE at the household level and examined the factors associated with CRE carriage through a detailed questionnaire. Genetic relationships among human- and animal-derived CRE were assessed using whole-genome sequencing-based molecular methods.A total of 88 New Delhi -type carbapenem-resistant  (NDM-EC), including 17 from humans, 44 from pigs, 12 from chickens, 1 from cattle, and 2 from dogs, were isolated from 65 of the 746 households examined. The remaining 12 NDM-EC were from flies in the immediate backyard environment. The NDM-EC  in households was significantly associated with ) the number of species of backyard animals raised/kept in the same household, and ) the use of human and/or animal feces as fertilizer. Discriminant analysis of principal components (DAPC) revealed that a large proportion of the core genomes of the NDM-EC belonged to strains from hosts other than their own, and several human isolates shared closely related core single-nucleotide polymorphisms and  genetic contexts with isolates from backyard animals.To our knowledge, we are the first to report evidence of direct transmission of NDM-EC between humans and animals. Given the rise of NDM-EC in community and hospital infections, combating NDM-EC transmission in backyard farm systems is needed. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP5251.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31314571>The developmentally regulated fetal enterocyte gene, , mediates anti-inflammation by the symbiotic bacterial surface factor polysaccharide A on .</a></h2><p>Initial colonizing bacteria play a critical role in completing the development of the immune system in the gastrointestinal tract of infants. Yet, the interaction of colonizing bacterial organisms with the developing human intestine favors inflammation over immune homeostasis. This characteristic of bacterial-intestinal interaction partially contributes to the pathogenesis of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), a devastating premature infant intestinal inflammatory disease. However, paradoxically some unique pioneer bacteria (initial colonizing species) have been shown to have a beneficial effect on the homeostasis of the immature intestine and the prevention of inflammation. We have reported that one such pioneer bacterium,  (), and its surface component polysaccharide A (PSA) inhibit IL-1β-induced inflammation in a human primary fetal small intestinal cell line (H4 cells). In this study, using transcription profiling of H4 cellular RNA after pretreatment with or without PSA before an inflammatory stimulation of IL-1β, we have begun to further determine the cellular mechanism for anti-inflammation. We show that a developmentally regulated gene, zona pellucida protein 4 (), is uniquely elevated after IL-1β stimulation and reduced with PSA exposure. ZP4 was known as a sperm receptor-mediating species-specific binding protein in the initial life of mammals. However, its intestinal epithelial function is unclear. We found that  is a developmentally regulated gene involved with immune function and regulated by both Toll-like receptor 2 and 4. Knockdown of -affected PSA inhibited IL-8 mRNA expression in response to IL-1β. This represents an initial study of  innate immune function in immature enterocytes. This study may lead to new opportunity for efficient treatment of NEC. This study extends previous observations to define the cellular mechanisms of polysaccharide A-induced anti-inflammation in immature enterocytes using transcription profiling of enterocyte genes after preexposure to polysaccharide A before an inflammatory stimulus with IL-1β.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31653220>Role of nuclear factor-kappa  in feline injection site sarcoma.</a></h2><p>Chronic inflammation has been implicated in sarcomagenesis. Among various factors, activation of nuclear factor-kappa  (NF-κ) signaling pathway has been documented being able to target genes associated with tumor progression and up-regulate the expression of tumor-promoting cytokines and survival genes in several human solid tumors. Feline injection sites sarcomas (FISS) are malignant entities derived from the mesenchymal origin. The disease has been considered to be associated with vaccine adjuvant, aluminum, which serves as a stimulus continuously inducing overzealous inflammatory and immunologic reactions. To understand the contribution of NF-κ in FISS, detection of activated NF-κ in paraffin-embedded specimens, in vitro establishment of primary cells derived from FISS, and evaluation of the effects of the NF-κ inhibitor, dehydroxymethylepoxyquinomicin (DHMEQ), on primary tumor cells were conducted.In this study, nuclear expression of NF-κ p65 was detected in 83.3% of FISS cases and not correlated with tumor grading, sex, and age. Primary cells derived from FISS in three cats exhibiting same immunohistochemical characteristics as their original tumor were successfully established. The NF-κ inhibitor, DHMEQ, was able to prevent nuclear translocation of NF-κ p65, inhibit cell proliferation, migration, and  in dosage-dependent manners, and induce cell apoptosis in these primary FISS cells.High expression rate of nuclear NF-κ p65 in FISS cases and dose-dependent inhibitory effects on the growth of FISS primary cells treated with NF-κ inhibitor suggested that NF-κ might be a potential molecular therapeutic target for FISS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31598670>Differential regulation of physiological activities by RcsB and OmpR in Yersinia enterocolitica.</a></h2><p>A thorough understanding of the mechanisms of Rcs and EnvZ/OmpR phosphorelay systems that allow Yersinia enterocolitica to thrive in various environments is crucial to prevent and control Y. enterocolitica infections. In this study, we showed that RcsB and OmpR have the ability to function differently in modulating a diverse array of physiological processes in Y. enterocolitica. The rcsB mutant stimulated flagella biosynthesis and increased motility, biofilm formation and c-di-GMP production by upregulating flhDC, hmsHFRS and hmsT. However, mutation in ompR exhibited a non-motile phenotype due to the lack of flagella. Biofilm formation was reduced and less c-di-GMP was produced through the downregulation of flhDC, hmsHFRS and hmsT expression when Y. enterocolitica was exposed to low osmolarity conditions. Furthermore, OmpR was identified to be important for Y. enterocolitica to grow in extreme temperature conditions. Importantly, ompR mutation in Y. enterocolitica were more sensitive to polymyxin  and SDS than rcsB mutation were. Since motility, biofilm formation and environmental tolerance are critical for bacterial  of the host, these findings indicated that OmpR is more critical than RcsB in shaping the pathogenic phenotype of Y. enterocolitica.© FEMS 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31510821>Rectovaginal group  streptococcus  among pregnant women in Nicaragua: a systematic review and meta-analysis.</a></h2><p> Maternal  with group  Streptococcus (GBS) is a predictor of neonatal sepsis. In Nicaragua, neonatal sepsis is a major cause of hospitalization, but it can be prevented with intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis. We undertook this study to estimate the pooled prevalence of rectovaginal GBS  among pregnant women 35-40-week gestation in Nicaragua, and sensitivity of GBS isolates to various antibiotics.  We systematically searched electronic databases of peer-reviewed and unpublished literature using prespecified search terms. We included English- and Spanish-language studies of rectovaginal GBS  and/or antibiotic sensitivity of GBS isolates that followed internationally-recognized diagnostic standards, from various sites and years. Two reviewers independently abstracted data and assessed risk of study bias. We then meta-analyzed the pooled prevalence of rectovaginal GBS  and antibiotic sensitivity of GBS isolates. We performed subgroup analyses by geographic location, urbanicity, and study risk of bias.  Prevalence of rectovaginal GBS  from 13 samples in 11 studies was 0.14 (95% CI: 0.09, 0.21). Effect size heterogeneity was identified between coastal (0.12 [95% CI: 0.07, 0.19]) and central study sites (0.23 [95% CI: 0.18, 0.28]), and between predominantly rural (0.06 [95% CI: 0.02, 0.10]) and urban (0.28 [95% CI: 0.19, 0.37]) samples of pregnant women. GBS sensitivity to penicillin, the first-line antibiotic for intrapartum prophylaxis, was 0.89 (95% CI: 0.71, 1.00) based on seven studies.  Maternal GBS  was substantial in some study sites. Most GBS isolates are sensitive to recommended antibiotics, and intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis may effectively prevent neonatal sepsis in Nicaragua.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31586658>Validity of surrogate endpoints assessing central venous catheter-related infection: evidence from individual- and study-level analyses.</a></h2><p>The prevention of catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI) has been an area of intense research, but the heterogeneity of endpoints used to define catheter infection makes the interpretation of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) problematic. The aim of this study was to determine the validity of different endpoints for central venous catheter infections.(a) Individual-catheter data were collected from 9428 catheters from four large RCTs; () study-level data from 70 RCTs were identified with a systematic search. Eligible studies were RCTs published between January 1987 and October 2018 investigating various interventions to reduce infections from short-term central venous catheters or short-term dialysis catheters. For each RCT the prevalence rates of CRBSI, quantitative catheter tip , catheter-associated infection (CAI) and central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) were extracted for each randomized study arm.CRBSI was used as the gold-standard endpoint, for which , CAI and CLABSI were evaluated as surrogate endpoints. Surrogate validity was assessed as (1) the individual partial coefficient of determination (individual-pR) using individual catheter data; (2) the coefficient of determination (study-R) from mixed-effect models regressing the therapeutic effect size of the surrogates on the effect size of CRBSI, using study-level data. showed poor agreement with CRBSI at the individual-patient level (pR = 0.33 95% CI 0.28-0.38) and poor capture at the study level (R = 0.42, 95% CI 0.21-0.58). CAI showed good agreement with CRBSI at the individual-patient level (pR = 0.80, 95% CI 0.76-0.83) and moderate capture at the study level (R = 0.71, 95% CI 0.51-0.85). CLABSI showed poor agreement with CRBSI at the individual patient level (pR = 0.34, 95% CI 0.23-0.46) and poor capture at the study level (R = 0.28, 95% CI 0.07-0.76).CAI is a moderate to good surrogate endpoint for CRBSI.  and CLABSI do not reliably reflect treatment effects on CRBSI and are consequently more suitable for surveillance than for clinical effectiveness research.Copyright © 2019 European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases.

Effectors can either modify or arrest host target proteins to sabotage the signaling pathway, and therefore are considered potential drug targets for crop disease control. In earlier research, the  type III effector XopAI was predicted to be a member of the arginine-specific mono-ADP-ribosyltransferase family. However, the crystal structure of XopAI revealed an altered active site that is unsuitable to bind the cofactor NAD+, but with the capability to capture an arginine-containing peptide from XopAI itself. The arginine peptide consists of residues 60 through 69 of XopAI, and residue 62 (R62) is key to determining the protein-peptide interaction. The crystal structure and the molecular dynamics simulation results indicate that specific arginine recognition is mediated by hydrogen bonds provided by the backbone oxygen atoms from residues W154, T155, and T156, and a salt bridge provided by the E265 sidechain. In addition, a protruding loop of XopAI adopts dynamic conformations in response to arginine peptide binding and is probably involved in target protein recognition. These data suggest that XopAI binds to its target protein by the peptide-binding ability, and therefore, it promotes disease progression. Our findings reveal an unexpected and intriguing function of XopAI and pave the way for further investigation on the role of XopAI in pathogen invasion.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31265728>Surrounding Vegetation, Climatic Elements, and Predators Affect the Spatial Dynamics of Bemisia tabaci (Hemiptera: Aleyrodidae) in Commercial Melon Fields.</a></h2><p>Studying the spatial dynamics of pests allows the determination of abiotic and biotic factors affecting time and locations of pest attack to the crops. Such abiotic and biotic factors mainly include 1) climatic elements, 2) natural enemies, 3) phenological stage of plants, and 4) surrounding vegetation. Melon (Cucumis melo L. [Cucurbitales: Cucurbitaceae]) is among the most consumed fruit in the world, and the whitefly Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius) is among the main pests of this crop. This work aimed to determine the effects of surrounding vegetation, natural enemies, climatic elements, and stages of plants on the spatial dynamics of . tabaci in commercial melon fields. Adult whitefly densities were monitored on four melon fields in a tropical climate region. Sampling location in crops was georeferenced. Experimental data were submitted to geostatistical analysis. The highest densities of . tabaci occurred during hot periods experiencing lower rainfall, and when the surrounding area presented crops hosting . tabaci, especially other melon farms. The density ratio of the predators (i.e., spiders and Geocoris sp.) were dependent on pest density. The pattern of field  by . tabaci varies according to its density. Therefore, the surrounding vegetation, air temperature, and predators influence the spatial distribution of . tabaci in melon fields. These results provide important information to melon farmers, assisting them to improve the management of . tabaci in the field.© The Author(s) 2019.

We are evaluating scenarios through an individual-level biodistance analysis using a three-pronged approach: (a) by analyzing levels of mobility in pre- and post-colonial periods under a model of isolation-by-distance; () by quantifying differences in group means and variances in pre- and post-colonial periods utilizing permutational multivariate analysis of variance and Betadisper analyses; and (c) by identifying ancestries of post-colonial individuals using naïve Bayes classification.Southern Italy during pre-colonial times was characterized by low levels of mobility and marked differences in group means and variances. During post-colonial times, mobility increased and there were no differences in group means and variances. About 18% of the people in post-colonial times were of Greek ancestry and lived equally distributed across Greek colonies and indigenous villages. Nevertheless, the overall biological composition and variability of southern Italy remained relatively unchanged across pre- and post-colonial periods.Our results support a scenario in which only few Greek colonists migrated to southern Italy and lived in smaller numbers alongside indigenous people in Greek colonies as well as in indigenous villages. Our results contradict a scenario in which large numbers of Greek invaders founded biologically isolated and substantially homogeneous colonial enclaves within conquered territories.© 2019 The Authors.

Among the approaches reported to deal with this problem, surfaces functionalization to render them with antimicrobial characteristics, comprises the most promising one. Most of these strategies, however, are designed to target bacterial biofilms, while fungal biofilms are much less taken into account. In real-life settings, fungi will be inevitably found in consortium with bacteria, especially in the field of biomaterials. The development of antifungal coating strategies to be combined with antibacterial approaches will be pivotal for the fight of biomaterial-associated infections. The main goal of the present study was, therefore, to engineer an effective strategy for the immobilization of liposomal amphotericin  (LAmB) on polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) surfaces to prevent  . Immobilization was performed using a two-step mussel-inspired coating strategy, in which PDMS is first immersed in dopamine solution. Its polymerization results in the deposition of a thin adherent film, called polydopamine (pDA), which allowed the incorporation of LAmB, afterwards. Different concentrations of LAmB were screened in order to obtain a contact-killing surface with no release of LAmB. Surface characterization confirmed the polymerization of dopamine and further functionalization with LAmB yielded surfaces with less roughness and more hydrophilic features. The proposed coating strategy rendered the surfaces of PDMS with the ability to prevent the attachment of  and kill the adherent cells, without toxicity toward mammalian cells. Overall results showed that LAmB immobilization on a surface retained its antifungal activity and reduced toxicity, holding therefore a great potential to be applied for the design of urinary catheters. Since the sessile communities commonly found associated to these devices exhibit a polymicrobial nature, the next challenge will be to co-immobilize LAmB with antibacterial agents to prevent the establishment of catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTI).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31170996>Intranasal administration with recombinant Bacillus subtilis induces strong mucosal immune responses against pseudorabies.</a></h2><p>Pseudorabies caused by pseudorabies virus (PRV) mainly infects the swine and seriously threatens the biosafety of the other animals, including humans. Since 2011, the outbreaks of PRV mutants have caused enormous economic losses in the swine industry, and traditional vaccines cannot offer enough protection. PRV can transmit by direct contact, aerosol transmission and pollutants. PRV mainly transmit through the nasal mucosa. After infecting the nasal epithelial cells, PRV can quickly infect the olfactory nerve and establish a potential infection of sensory neurons. Therefore, nasal immunity can effectively prevent viral  infection. Recombinant Bacillus subtilis has been widely used to deliver antigen and achieve adequate protective immune responses.The present study successfully constructed recombinant Bacillus subtilis (. subtilis) expressing the dominant antigen regions of PRV gC and gD proteins (named . subtilis-gCa and . subtilis-gDa). Furtherly, we evaluated the immunogenicity of the two recombinant . subtilis in mice. The mice intranasal administration with . subtilis-gCa and . subtilis-gDa effectively stimulated IgA and IgG immune responses, further regulated specific T lymphocytes proliferative response by IFN-γ and IL-10, and ultimately produced high titers of neutralizing antibodies against PRV infection. In particular, . subtilis-gDa possessed more excellent immune effect than . subtilis-gCa in mice.These results suggested that . subtilis-gCa and . subtilis-gDa could trigger high levels of mucosal and systemic immune responses and would be potential candidates for developing PRV vaccines.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31635539>Lethality of  in a murine model of infection depends on the  gene involved in O-polysaccharide synthesis.</a></h2><p> was isolated a decade ago from wildlife and soil in Europe.

Therefore, the main aim was to quantify the amniotic fluid NAMPT in women with PPROM complicated by intra-amniotic infection, sterile IAI, or . The second aim was to characterize the diagnostic indices of NAMPT to reveal IAI. The third aim was to determine whether the cervical fluid and maternal serum NAMPT quantitation might be of value in the identification of intra-amniotic inflammatory complications in PPROM.NAMPT levels in amniotic fluid, cervical fluid, and maternal serum were assessed in three independent cohorts of women with singleton pregnancies complicated by PPROM between 24 and 36 weeks of gestation consisting of 88, 121, and 88 women, respectively. Amniotic fluid samples were obtained by transabdominal amniocentesis, cervical fluid samples were obtained using a Dacron polyester swab and maternal blood was obtained by venipuncture of the cubital vein. The NAMPT levels were measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Testing for MIAC and IAI was performed on all women, who were then categorized into four subgroups: intra-amniotic infection (MIAC and IAI), sterile IAI (IAI alone),  (MIAC alone), and without MIAC and IAI.Women with intra-amniotic infection and women with sterile IAI had higher NAMPT levels than did women with  and women without MIAC and IAI (intra-amniotic infection: median 73.6 ng/mL, sterile IAI: median 55.5 ng/mL, : median 12.1 ng/mL, without MIAC and IAI: 10.6 ng/mL; p < .0001). An amniotic fluid NAMPT level of 37 ng/mL was the best value for the detection of intra-amniotic infection in women with PPROM.

For method A, the mice were intragastrically administered with Helicobacter pylori suspension (0.2 mL per mouse), once two day for 5 times; for method , the mice were intragastrically administered with Helicobacter pylori (0.2 mL per mouse) once a day for 5 times; for method C, the mice were perfused with 0.4 mL per mouse of Helicobacter pylori suspension on the first day, then once a day and 0.2 mL per mouse for 3 times; for method D, the mice were administrated with 0.4 mL per mouse Helicobacter pylori suspension on the first day, 0.2 mL per mouse every other day for 3 times. For method E, the mice received equal amounts of normal saline. The mice were killed at 2, 4, and 6 weeks after gavage. The gastric mucosa was detected by rapid urease test for Helicobacter pylori infection, and gastric mucosa was taken for HE staining to observe the degree of infection.  Results: After 2 weeks of gavage, the infection rates of the mice in A, , C, and D group were 33.3%, 50.0%, 66.7%, and 33.3%, respectively. The degree of inflammation infection was as following order: C group> group>D group>A group>E group. The infection rates of mice after 4 weeks of gavage in the A, , C, and D groups were 50.0%, 83.3%, 83.3%, and 66.7%, respectively. The degree of inflammation infection was as following order: C group> group>D group>A group>E group. After 6 weeks of gavage, the infection rate in A, , C, and D groups was 100%, while the degree of inflammation infection was as following order: C group>D group> group>A group>E group.  Conclusion: At the acute stage of Helicobacter pylori infection, different gavage methods show different infection rates in mice, and the degree of inflammation is different. At the chronic stage, different gavage methods display the same infection rate in mice with different degree. The gavage method that 0.4 mL Helicobacter pylori suspension on the first day, then once a day and 0.2 mL for 3 times is most conducive to Helicobacter pylori  in the gastric mucosa of mice. This method can induce the the most seriou inflammatory infection and is beneficial to the successful establishment of the Helicobacter pylori infection model.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31041592>Integrative evidence confirms new endemic island frogs and transmarine dispersal of amphibians between Madagascar and Mayotte (Comoros archipelago).</a></h2><p>Previous genetic studies of frogs from Mayotte Island (a French Overseas Department in the Comoros Archipelago) in the Western Indian Ocean have provided evidence for oceanic dispersal in amphibians, which is a rare phenomenon due to the osmotic intolerance of amphibians to saline water. Using an integrative approach including morphological, bioacoustic, and genetic evidence, we here confirm that these frogs correspond to two new species and are the only representatives of the family Mantellidae not endemic to Madagascar. Blommersia transmarina sp. nov. differs from its sister taxon, . wittei, by several morphological differences including larger body size (snout-vent length up to 34.5 mm) and by slight differences in advertisement calls. Boophis nauticus sp. nov. differs from its closest relatives, . tephraeomystax and . doulioti, by slight morphological differences (including larger body size), a reddish (vs. silvery or golden) iris coloration in life, and slightly different advertisement calls. The two new species differ from their closest relatives by a substantial genetic differentiation, with pairwise genetic distances > 5% in the mitochondrial 16S rRNA gene, and based on the limited available data, also by distinct differences in nuclear DNA. They also are both larger than their closest relatives from Madagascar and . transmarina sp. nov. is the largest Blommersia species, suggesting a moderate form of island gigantism. The Madagascan sister species . wittei and . doulioti are among the relatively few amphibian species occurring in the arid western biomes of the island, are adapted to open landscape, and reproduce in stagnant water bodies, which we hypothesize may represent important preadaptations for successful overseas .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31198422>Partial Characterization of Novel Bacteriocin SF1 Produced by  and Their Lethal Activity on Members of Gut Microbiota.</a></h2><p>A strain of  producing bacteriocin was isolated from a patient with diarrhea.

Here we report epidemiological, clinical, and microbiological investigations of a C. auris outbreak in a regional Omani hospital between April 2018 and April 2019. The outbreak started in the intensive care areas (intensive care unit (ICU), coronary care unit (CCU), and high dependency unit) but cases were subsequently diagnosed in other medical and surgical units. In addition to the patients' clinical and screening samples, environmental swabs from high touch areas and from the hands of 35 staff were collected. All the positive samples from patients and environmental screening were confirmed using MALDI-TOF, and additional ITS-rDNA sequencing was done for ten clinical and two environmental isolates. There were 32 patients positive for C. auris of which 14 (43.8%) had urinary tract infection, 11 (34.4%) had candidemia, and 7 (21.8%) had asymptomatic skin . The median age was 64 years (14-88) with 17 (53.1%) male and 15 (46.9%) female patients. Prior to diagnosis, 21 (65.6%) had been admitted to the intensive care unit, and 11 (34.4%) had been nursed in medical or surgical wards. The crude mortality rate in our patient's cohort was 53.1. Two swabs collected from a ventilator in two different beds in the ICU were positive for C. auris. None of the health care worker samples were positive. Molecular typing showed that clinical and environmental isolates were genetically similar and all belonged to the South Asian C. auris clade I. Most isolates had non-susceptible fluconazole (100%) and amphotericin  (33%) minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs), but had low echinocandin and voriconazole MICs. Despite multimodal infection prevention and control measures, new cases continued to appear, challenging all the containment efforts.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31225737>Effect of Specimen Type and Processing on the Detection of  in Piglet Fecal Samples.</a></h2><p>Subclinical   in piglets could be a potential source of this bacterium for community-acquired  infection. The purposes of this study were to assess the effect of specimen type and processing on  isolation, culture, and detection by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and to determine the occurrence of  in piglets of different ages. We compared different culture procedures-direct plating, ethanol shock, and an enrichment step-to isolate  from swine feces and rectal swabs. DNA was isolated directly from feces, processed feces, and bacterial isolates to detect the triose phosphate isomerase () gene and identify the toxins A and  genes. The results show that ethanol shock increased the  isolation from feces, while it decreased it for rectal swabs, in comparison with direct plating. The use of the enrichment broth gave the highest  recovery from both types of specimen. Our findings show low sensitivity for  gene detection after the DNA extraction directly from feces and an increase in PCR-positive samples when feces were processed before the DNA extraction. The overall prevalence of  was 16.9% (22/130), of which 100% were found to be toxigenic as assessed by the enrichment culture of fecal samples. The rate of isolation of positive samples decreased with the animal age, regardless of the presence or absence of diarrhea. Our results demonstrate the persistent reservoir of toxigenic  in fecal samples of piglets and support the impact of specimen processing on its isolation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31630683>Evaluation of the safety, tolerance and efficacy of 1-year consumption of infant formula supplemented with Lactobacillus fermentum CECT5716 Lc40 or Bifidobacterium breve CECT7263: a randomized controlled trial.</a></h2><p>The microorganism present in breast milk, added to other factors, determine the  of infants. The objective of the present study is to evaluate the safety, tolerance and effects of the consumption of a milk formula during the first year of life that is supplemented with L. fermentum CECT5716 or Bifidobacterium breve CECT7263, two strains originally isolated from breast milk.A randomized, double blind, controlled, parallel group study including healthy, formula-fed infants was conducted. Two hundred and thirty-six 1-month-old infants were selected and randomly divided into three study groups according to a randomization list. Infants in the control group received a standard powdered infant formula until 12 months of age. Infants in the probiotic groups received the same infant formula but supplemented with L. fermentum CECT5716 Lc40 or . breve CECT7263. Main outcome was weigh-gain of infants as safety marker.One hundred and eighty-nine infants completed the eleven months of intervention (61 in control group, 65 in Lf group and 63 in Bb group). The growth of infants in the three groups was consistent with standards. No significant differences were observed in the main outcome, weight-gain (Control group: 5.77 Kg ± 0.95, Lf group: 5.77 Kg ± 1.31, Bb group: 5.58 Kg ± 1.10; p = 0.527). The three milk formulae were well tolerated, and no adverse effects were related to the consumption of any of the formula. Infants receiving . breve CECT7263 had a 1.7 times lower risk of crying than the control group (OR = 0.569, CI 95% 0.568-0.571; p = 0.001). On the other hand, the incidence of diarrhoea in infants receiving the formula supplemented with L. fermentum CECT5716 was a 44% lower than in infants receiving the control formula (p = 0.014).

However, the interactions between these plant-beneficial bacteria are understudied. Here, we explore the interaction between Bacillus subtilis 3610 and Pseudomonas chlororaphis PCL1606. We show that the extracellular matrix protects . subtilis colonies from infiltration by P. chlororaphis. The absence of extracellular matrix results in increased fluidity and loss of structure of the . subtilis colony. The P. chlororaphis type VI secretion system (T6SS) is activated upon contact with . subtilis cells, and stimulates . subtilis sporulation. Furthermore, we find that . subtilis sporulation observed prior to direct contact with P. chlororaphis is mediated by histidine kinases KinA and KinB. Finally, we demonstrate the importance of the extracellular matrix and the T6SS in modulating the coexistence of the two species on melon plant leaves and seeds.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31604057>Identification and characterization of primordial germ cells in a vocal learning Neoaves species, the zebra finch.</a></h2><p>The zebra finch has been used as a valuable vocal learning animal model for human spoken language. It is representative of vocal learning songbirds specifically, which comprise half of all bird species, and of Neoaves broadly, which comprise 95% of all bird species. Although transgenesis in the zebra finch has been accomplished, it is with a very low efficiency of germ-line transmission and far from the efficiency with a more genetically tractable but vocal nonlearning species, the chicken (a Galloanseriformes). To improve germ-line transmission in the zebra finch, we identified and characterized its primordial germ cells (PGCs) and compared them with chicken. We found striking differences between the 2 species, including that zebra finch PGCs were more numerous, more widely distributed in early embryos before  into the gonads, had slower timing of , and had a different developmental gene-expression program. We improved conditions for isolating and culturing zebra finch PGCs  and were able to transfect them with gene-expression vectors and incorporate them into the gonads of host embryos.

Although gut  by  is a key determinant of disease outcome, precise mechanisms of mucosal attachment and spread remain unclear. Here, using human gut epithelial monolayers co-cultured within dual environment chambers, we demonstrate that  adhesion to gut epithelial cells is accompanied by a gradual increase in bacterial numbers.

Here, we have evaluated riboflavin (B2 vitamin) production by five  strains isolated from , a traditional maize-based fermented alcoholic beverage from north-western Argentina and their isogenic riboflavin-overproducing derivatives previously selected using roseoflavin. A direct fluorescence spectroscopic detection method to quantify riboflavin production in bacterial culture supernatants has been tested. Comparison of the efficiency for riboflavin fluorescence quantification with and without prior HPLC fractionation showed that the developed method is a rapid and easy test for selection of B2 vitamin-producing strains.

On the basis of this and previous analyses, the  M5MA1-B2 riboflavin overproducer was selected for  and  studies after being fluorescently labeled by transfer of the pRCR12 plasmid, which encodes the mCherry protein. The labeling did not affect negatively the growth, the riboflavin production nor the adhesion of the strain to Caco-2 cells.

Inability to independently culture and genetically manipulate Treponema pallidum subsp. pallidum, the causative agent of this disease, has hindered our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of syphilis pathogenesis. Here, we used the non-infectious and poorly adherent B314 strain of the Lyme disease-causing spirochete, Borrelia burgdorferi, to express two variants of a known fibronectin-binding adhesin, Tp0136, from T. pallidum SS14 and Nichols strains. Using this surrogate system, we investigated the ability of Tp0136 in facilitating differential binding to mammalian cell lines offering insight into the possible role of this virulence factor in  of specific tissues by T. pallidum during infection.Expression of Tp0136 could be detected on the surface of . burgdorferi by indirect immunofluorescence assay using sera from a secondary syphilis patient that does not react with intact B314 spirochetes transformed with the empty vector. Increase in Tp0136-mediated adherence of B314 strain to human epithelial HEK293 cells was observed with comparable levels of binding exhibited by both Tp0136 alleles. Adherence of Tp0136-expressing B314 was highest to epithelial HEK293 and C6 glioma cells. Gain in binding of B314 strain expressing Tp0136 to purified fibronectin and poor binding of these spirochetes to the fibronectin-deficient cell line (HEp-2) indicated that Tp0136 interaction with this host receptor plays an important role in spirochetal attachment to mammalian cells. Furthermore, preincubation of these cell lines with fibronectin-binding peptide from Staphylococcus aureus FnbA-2 protein significantly inhibited binding of B314 expressing Tp0136.Our results show that Tp0136 facilitates differential level of binding to cell lines representing various host tissues, which highlights the importance of this protein in  of human organs by T. pallidum and resulting syphilis pathogenesis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31095449>Potential roles of marine fungi in the decomposition process of standing stems and leaves of .</a></h2><p>Fungal communities inhabiting live, senescent, and decaying leaf sheaths, stems, and leaf blades of standing plants of  in two Portuguese salt marshes were assessed by morphological identification of fruiting structures and sequence-based identification based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-cloning analysis of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) rDNA.

Importantly, our results support that cpsA is indispensable for virulence in A. fumigatus infection of non-neutropenic hosts. Our study revealed that cpsA affects growth and sporulation in this fungus. Absence of cpsA resulted in a drastic reduction in conidiation, and forced overexpression of cpsA produced partially fluffy colonies with low sporulation levels, suggesting that wild-type cpsA expression levels are required for proper conidiation in this fungus. This study also showed that cpsA is necessary for normal cell wall integrity and composition. Furthermore, both deletion and overexpression of cpsA resulted in a reduction in the ability of A. fumigatus to adhere to surfaces, and caused increased sensitivity to oxidative stress. Interestingly, metabolomics analysis indicated that cpsA affects A. fumigatus secondary metabolism. Forced overexpression of cpsA resulted in a statistically significant difference in the production of fumigaclavine A, fumigaclavine , fumigaclavine C, verruculogen TR-2, and tryprostatin A.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31543613>Detection of  in subgingival biofilms of healthy, gingivitis, and chronic periodontitis subjects.</a></h2><p> is a Gram-positive, facultative anaerobic coccus that can survive under harsh conditions.

This secretion system has emerged as a key player in regulating the microbial diversity in a population. In the plant pathogen Agrobacterium tumefaciens, the signalling cascades regulating the activity of this secretion system are poorly understood. Here, we outline how the universal eubacterial second messenger cyclic di-GMP impacts the production of T6SS toxins and T6SS structural components. We demonstrate that this has a significant impact on the ability of the phytopathogen to compete with other bacterial species in vitro and in planta. Our results suggest that, as opposed to other bacteria, c-di-GMP turns down the T6SS in A. tumefaciens thus impacting its ability to compete with other bacterial species within the rhizosphere. We also demonstrate that elevated levels of c-di-GMP within the cell decrease the activity of the Type IV secretion system (T4SS) and subsequently the capacity of A. tumefaciens to transform plant cells. We propose that such peculiar control reflects on c-di-GMP being a key second messenger that silences energy-costing systems during early  phase and biofilm formation, while low c-di-GMP levels unleash T6SS and T4SS to advance plant .© 2019 The Authors.

However, the mechanism by which Th17/Th1-driven cellular immunity kills  and the role of LtB remains unclear. Here, two   strains, expressing  NapA and LtB, respectively, were orally administrated to mice. As observed, the administration of LtB significantly enhanced the fecal SIgA level and decreased gastric  , but also markedly aggravated gastric inflammatory injury. Both NapA group and NapA+LtB group had elevated splenocyte production of IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, IL-17, IL-23 and INF-γ. Notably, gastric leukocytes' migration or leakage into the mucus was observed more frequently in NapA+LtB group than in NapA group. This report is the first that discusses how LtB enhances vaccine-induced anti- efficacy by aggravating gastric injury and leukocytes' movement into the mucus layer. Significantly, it brings up a novel explanation for the mechanism underlying mucosal cellular immunity destroying the non-invasive pathogens. More importantly, the findings suggest the necessity to further evaluate LtB's potential hazards to humans before extending its applications.

Among other uses, it has been applied against dermatitis and eczema often worsened by staphylococcal  of the skin.The study was conducted to evaluate applicability of N. sativa seed extract in antibacterial skin formulations by examination of its activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus as well as cytotoxicity against human dermal fibroblasts.Two variants of N. sativa seed extract containing 9.91 and 2.10 % of thymoquinone were prepared by supercritical carbon dioxide extraction. The extracts and standards of their major volatile ingredients; thymoquinone, thymol, p-cymene alongside with the reference antiseptics; chlorquinaldol and a combination of amylmetacresol with 2,4-dichlorobenzyl alcohol were subjected to evaluation of antibacterial efficacy against a collection of Staphylococcus aureus strains. The preparation based on Vaseline containing 1% of N. sativa extract was applied on Mueller-Hinton agar plates and its ability to inhibit S. aureus growth was examined. The MTT assay was employed to study cytotoxic effects of the thymoquinone-rich N. sativa seed extract against HDFa fibroblasts.N. sativa seed extract and thymoquinone have shown potent bacteriostatic and bactericidal effect against Staphylococcus aureus, including methicillin-resistant strains (MRSA) isolated in Poland. Results suggest that N. sativa seed extract activity against S. aureus should mainly be attributed to thymoquinone, which was effective in concentrations of 4-16 μg/ml. Regarding the activity against S. aureus, thymoquinone was more efficient than a combination of amylmetacresol with 2,4-dichlorobenzyl alcohol and comparable to chlorquinaldol. The Vaseline-based preparation containing N. sativa extract caused growth inhibition comparable to an equally concentrated DMSO solution of the extract. The IC50 of N. sativa extract against HDFa fibroblast was determined at 0.2 mg/ml, which was 2-fold higher than the average MIC and MBC of the extract against S. aureus.The observed effectiveness of N. sativa seed extracts against bacteria was found to be dominantly dependent on concentration of thymoquinone. Its efficiency against S. aureus isolates as well as results of cytotoxicity examination against human dermal fibroblasts indicate on its applicability as an antibacterial agent for topical use and motivates further research in this area.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier .V.

Chronic H. pylori infection promotes the genetic instability of gastric epithelial cells and interferes with the DNA repair systems in host cells.  of the stomach with H. pylori is an important cause of non-cardia GC and gastric MALT lymphoma. The reduction of GC development in patients who underwent anti-H. pylori eradication schemes has also been well described. Individual susceptibility to GC development depends on the host's genetic predisposition, H. pylori virulence factors, environmental conditions, and geographical determinants. Biological determinants are urgently sought to predict the clinical course of infection in individuals with confirmed H. pylori infection. Possible candidates for such biomarkers include genetic aberrations such as single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) found in various cytokines/growth factors (e.g., IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-13, IL-17A/, IFN-γ, TNF, TGF-β) and their receptors (IL-RN, TGFR), innate immunity receptors (TLR2, TLR4, CD14, NOD1, NOD2), enzymes involved in signal transduction cascades (PLCE1, PKLR, PRKAA1) as well as glycoproteins (MUC1, PSCA), and DNA repair enzymes (ERCC2, XRCC1, XRCC3). Bacterial determinants related to GC development include infection with CagA-positive (particularly with a high number of EPIYA-C phosphorylation motifs) and VacA-positive isolates (in particular s1/m1 allele strains). The combined genotyping of bacterial and host determinants suggests that the accumulation of polymorphisms favoring host and bacterial features increases the risk for precancerous and cancerous lesions in patients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669527>[Term Prelabor Rupture of Membranes: CNGOF Guidelines for Clinical Practice - Short Text].</a></h2><p>To determine the management of patients with term prelabor rupture of membranes Methods: Synthesis of the literature from the PubMed and Cochrane databases and the recommendations of French and foreign societies and colleges.Term prelabor rupture of membranes is considered a physiological process up to 12 hours of rupture (Professional consensus). In case of expectant management and with a low rate of antibiotic prophylaxis, home care compared to hospitalization could be associated with an increase in neonatal infections (LE3), especially in case of group  streptococcus  (LE3). Home care is therefore not recommended (Grade C). In the absence of spontaneous labor within 12 hours of rupture, antibiotic prophylaxis could reduce the risk of maternal intrauterine infection but not of neonatal infection (LE3). Its use after 12 hours of rupture in term prelabor rupture of the membranes is therefore recommended (Grade C). When antibiotic prophylaxis is indicated, intravenous beta-lactams are recommended (Grade C). Induction of labor with oxytocin (LE1), prostaglandin E2 (LE1) or misoprostol (LE1), is associated with shorter rupture of membranes to delivery intervals when compared to expectant management. Compared with expectant management, immediate induction of labor is not associated with lower rates of neonatal infection (LE1), even among women with a positive streptococcus  vaginal swab (LE2). Thus, expectant management can be offered without increasing the risk of neonatal infection (Grade ). Induction of labor is not associated with an increase or decrease in the cesarean delivery rate (LE2), whatever parity (LE2) or Bishop score at admission (LE3). Induction can thus be proposed without increasing the risk of cesarean delivery (Grade ). No induction method (oxytocin, dinoprostone, misoprostol or Foley Catheter) has demonstrated superiority over another, whether to reduce rate of intrauterine or neonatal infection, rate of cesarean delivery or to shorten rupture of membranes to delivery intervals regardless of Bishop's score and parity.Term prelabor rupture of membranes is a frequent event. A 12-hour delay without onset of spontaneous labor was chosen to differentiate a physiological condition from a potentially unsafe situation justifying an antibiotic prophylaxis. Expectant management or induction of labor can both be proposed, even in case of positive screening for streptococcus , depending on the patient's wishes and maternity units' organization (Professional consensus).Copyright © 2019.

The alteration of digestive anatomy promoted by bariatric surgery may be a pre-disposing factor for SIBO. In this context, the prevalence of SIBO in participants undergoing bariatric surgery using Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (BGYR) was evaluated.Participants, both sexes, older than 18 years, were those who (a) had bariatric surgery by the BGYR technique at least 1 year before the data collection and () did not use antibiotics recently. The SIBO diagnosis was established through the hydrogen breath test (HBT), with intake of lactulose and serial collection of breath samples over 2 h. A test with ≥ 12-point elevation over the basal sample at 60 min after substrate intake was deemed positive.A total of 18 participants (14 females (77.8%)) were enrolled with a mean age of 50.5 years (range, 23 to 79 years).

We conducted a pilot study to determine the prevalence of GBS among pregnant women in Amman, Jordan, where GBS testing is not routine. We also explored GBS serotypes and the performance of a rapid GBS antigen diagnostic test.We collected vaginal-rectal swabs from women who presented for labor and delivery at Al-Bashir Hospital. Three methods were used to identify GBS: Strep  Rapid Test (Creative Diagnostics), blood agar media (Remel) with confirmed with BBL Streptocard acid latex test (Becton Dickinson), and CHROMagar StrepB (Remel). Results were read by a senior microbiologist. We defined our gold standard for GBS-positive as a positive blood agar culture confirmed by latex agglutination and positive CHROMagar. PCR testing determined serotype information. Demographic and clinical data were also collected.In April and May 2015, 200 women were enrolled with a median age of 27 years (IQR: 23-32); 89.0% were Jordanian nationals and 71.9% completed secondary school. Median gestational age was 38 weeks (IQR: 37-40); most women reported prenatal care (median 9 visits; IQR: 8-12). Median parity was 2 births (IQR: 1-3). Pre-pregnancy median BMI was 24.1 (IQR: 21.5-28.0) and 14.5% reported an underlying medical condition. Obstetric complications included gestational hypertension (9.5%), gestational diabetes (6.0%), and UTI (53.5%), of which 84.5% reported treatment. Overall, 39 (19.5%) of women were GBS-positive on blood agar media and CHROMagar, while 67 (33.5%) were positive by rapid test (36% sensitivity, 67% specificity). Serotype information was available for 25 (64%) isolates: III (48%), Ia (24%), II (20%), and V (8%). No demographic or clinical differences were noted between GBS+ and GBS-negative women.Nearly one in five women presenting for labor in Jordan was colonized with GBS, with serotype group III as the most common. The rapid GBS antigen diagnostic had low sensitivity and specificity. These results support expanded research in the region, including defining GBS resistance patterns, serotyping information, and risk factors.

To date, there is no effective vaccine for swine. This prompted us to investigate the potential use of the commercially available vaccine for cattle or the live attenuated vaccine candidate S19Δ. As the first step, we sought to study the safety of the vaccine candidates when administered in pregnant sows, since one of the major drawbacks associated with vaccination using Live Attenuated Vaccines (LAV) is the induction of abortions when administered in pregnant animals. Fifteen pregnant gilts at mid-gestation were divided into four groups and subsequently vaccinated subcutaneously using different formulations containing 2.0 ± 0.508 × 10 CFU of either S19 or S19Δ. Vaccination in pregnant animals with the vaccine candidates did not induce abortion, stillbirths or a reduction in litter size. Multiple tissues in the gilts and piglets were examined at the time of delivery to assess bacterial  and histopathological changes. There was no evidence of vaccine persistence in the gilts or bacterial  in the fetuses. Altogether, these data suggest that both vaccine candidates are safe for use in pregnant swine. Analysis of the humoral responses, specifically anti- IgG levels measured in serum, demonstrated a robust response induced by either vaccine, but of shorter duration (4-6 weeks post-inoculation) compared to that observed in cattle or experimentally infected mice. Such a transient humoral response may prove to be beneficial in cases where the vaccine is used in eradication campaigns and in the differentiation of vaccinated from infected animals.

A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was carried out to amplify the genes encoding the 67-72p protein and three pili structural proteins (SpaC, SpaI, SapD) and the products obtained were sequenced. The nucleotide sequences of the particular genes were translated into amino acid sequences, which were then matched among all the tested strains using bioinformatics tools. In the last step, the affinity of the tested proteins to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) classes I and II, and linear -cell epitopes was analyzed. The variations in the nucleotide sequence of the 67-72p protein and pili structural proteins among  strains isolated from various infections were noted. A transposition of the insertion sequence within the gene encoding the SpaC pili structural proteins was also detected. In addition, the bioinformatics analyses enabled the identification of epitopes for -cells and T-cells in the conserved regions of the proteins, thus, demonstrating that these proteins could be used as antigens in the potential vaccine development.

However, common wild rice (Oryza rufipogon), which is the ancestor of Asian cultivated rice (O. sativa), has significant potential as a genetic source of resistance to M. oryzae. Recent studies have shown that the domestication of rice has altered its relationship to symbiotic arbuscular mycorrhizae. A comparative response of wild and domestic rice inhabited by mycorrhizae to infection by M. oryzae has not been documented.In the current study, roots of wild and cultivated rice colonized with the arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungus (AMF) Rhizoglomus intraradices were used to compare the transcriptomic responses of the two species to infection by M. oryzae. Phenotypic analysis indicated that the  of wild and cultivated rice with R. intraradices improved the resistance of both genotypes to M. oryzae. Wild AM rice, however, was more resistant to M. oryzae than the cultivated AM rice, as well as nonmycorrhizal roots of wild rice. Transcriptome analysis indicated that the mechanisms regulating the responses of wild and cultivated AM rice to M. oryzae invasion were significantly different. The expression of a greater number of genes was changed in wild AM rice than in cultivated AM rice in response to the pathogen. Both wild and cultivated AM rice exhibited a shared response to M. oryzae which included genes related to the auxin and salicylic acid pathways; all of these play important roles in pathogenesis-related protein synthesis. In wild AM rice, secondary metabolic and biotic stress-related analyses indicated that the jasmonic acid synthesis-related α-linolenic acid pathway, the phenolic and terpenoid pathways, as well as the phenolic and terpenoid syntheses-related mevalonate (MVA) pathway were more affected by the pathogen. Genes related to these pathways were more significantly enriched in wild AM rice than in cultivated AM rice in response to M. oryzae. On the other hand, genes associated with the 'brassinosteroid biosynthesis' were more enriched in cultivated AM rice.The AMF R. intraradices-colonized rice plants exhibited greater resistance to M. oryzae than non-AMF-colonized plants. The findings of the current study demonstrate the potential effects of crop domestication on the benefits received by the host via root  with AMF(s), and provide new information on the underlying molecular mechanisms.

Although treatment of bolts with the . bassiana suspension did not reduce P. juglandis  or short-term emergence relative to the control treatment, it increased the . bassiana infection rate from 25 to 62% of emerged adults. Results suggest that commercial applications of . bassiana strain GHA may help augment natural levels of infection by this entomopathogen in the eastern United States, and support continued exploration of entomopathogens for biological control of the walnut twig beetle.Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Entomological Society of America 2019.This work is written by (a) US Government employee(s) and is in the public domain in the US.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31571725>Protective efficacy of a  vaccine using a -based delivery system expressing  Omp3b, BCSP31, and SOD proteins against brucellosis in Korean black goats.</a></h2><p>This study aimed to assess the protective efficacy of a novel  vaccine formulation in goats. Twenty black goats were separated into 2 groups. Group A was injected with 3.0 × 10 CFU (colony-forming units)/mL of a -based delivery system harboring only vector (pMMP65). Group  was immunized with 3.0 × 10 CFU/mL of the vaccine, a mixture of 3  vaccine strains (using a -based delivery system) expressing each recombinant  Omp3b, BCSP31, and SOD protein. No  delivery strain was isolated from all tested lymph nodes and parenchymal organs. Serum immunoglobulin (Ig) G titers and interferon gamma concentrations were significantly higher in group  than those in group A. After intraconjunctival challenge with virulent  strain 544, 40% of the vaccinated animals in group  were protected against  infection. The infection index and  of  in tested tissues was significantly lower in group  than group A.

While multiple therapies are used for their treatment, these are ineffective, expensive, and labour-intensive. Thus, there is an enormous unmet need for the treatment of infected wounds. Cinnamaldehyde, the major component of cinnamon oil, is well known for its antimicrobial properties. Herein, we investigated the effects of sub-inhibitory concentrations of cinnamaldehyde in the virulence of . We also assessed its healing potential in -infected mouse skin wounds and the mechanisms involved in this response. Sub-inhibitory concentrations of cinnamaldehyde reduced  metabolic rate and its ability to form biofilm and to cause haemolysis. Daily topical application of cinnamaldehyde on -infected skin wounds reduced tissue bacterial load and promoted faster healing. Lower interleukin-17 (IL-17), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and nitric oxide levels were detected in cinnamaldehyde-treated wound samples. Blockage of transient receptor potential ankyrin 1, the pharmacological target of cinnamaldehyde, abrogated its healing activity and partially reversed the inhibitory actions of this compound on VEGF and IL-17 generation. We suggest that topical application of sub-inhibitory concentrations of cinnamaldehyde may represent an interesting approach to improve the healing of -infected skin wounds.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31074290>Understandings of dementia in low and middle income countries and amongst indigenous peoples: a systematic review and qualitative meta-synthesis.</a></h2><p>Dementia is a growing health priority, particularly in less resourced countries and amongst indigenous populations. Understanding cultural meanings ascribed to dementia is an important aspect of policy development and the provision of culturally congruent care and support for people with dementia, their families and the caring professions. This review investigates conceptualizations of dementia amongst indigenous peoples and populations living in low and middle income countries (LMIC), who experience limited diagnosis and formal care for dementia, and how these shape responses to dementia.A systematic search was conducted for qualitative studies, reported in English, that investigated the perceptions, attitudes or understandings of dementia in LMIC and amongst indigenous populations. A qualitative analysis and meta-synthesis was carried out.Nineteen articles were included in the review following quality assessment. Dementia was rarely conceptualized as a defined, pathological condition characterized by progressive cognitive decline. Rather, notions of dementia existed within conceptualizations of aging, mental illness, traditional cultural beliefs and the trauma of . Responses to dementia were influenced and perpetuated by community and health providers, and cultural norms for caregiving.There is a need to understand conceptualizations of dementia from the perspective of all stakeholders within a setting, and the dynamic responses that exist between key stakeholders. Community knowledge systems could facilitate understanding about appropriate and acceptable health and community care responses to dementia, and approaches to stigma reduction. Inclusive discussions about dementia are essential if awareness campaigns are to improve the wellbeing of people with dementia and caregivers.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31546599>Pertussis Toxin: A Key Component in Pertussis Vaccines?</a></h2><p> is a human-specific pathogen and the causative agent of whooping cough. The ongoing resurgence in pertussis incidence in high income countries is likely due to faster waning of immunity and increased asymptomatic  in individuals vaccinated with acellular pertussis (aP) vaccine relative whole-cell pertussis (wP)-vaccinated individuals. This has renewed interest in developing more effective vaccines and treatments and, in support of these efforts, defining pertussis vaccine correlates of protection and the role of vaccine antigens and toxins in disease. Pertussis and its toxins have been investigated by scientists for over a century, yet we still do not have a clear understanding of how pertussis toxin (PT) contributes to disease symptomology or how anti-PT immune responses confer protection. This review covers PT's role in disease and evidence for its protective role in vaccines. Clinical data suggest that PT is a defining and essential toxin for  pathogenesis and, when formulated into a vaccine, can prevent disease. Additional studies are required to further elucidate the role of PT in disease and vaccine-mediated protection, to inform the development of more effective treatments and vaccines.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31464711>Class-switched Primary Cutaneous Marginal Zone Lymphomas Are Frequently IgG4-positive and Have Features Distinct From IgM-positive Cases.</a></h2><p>Primary cutaneous marginal zone lymphoma (PCMZL) can be subdivided into 2 groups based on immunoglobulin (Ig) heavy chain usage: IgM-positive cases that constitute a less common and more T-helper type 1-driven process, and more common heavy chain class-switched cases that are predominantly T-helper type 2-driven. Although some report a significant IgG4-positive subset, others have found a much smaller proportion. To further evaluate the proportion of IgG4-positive PCMZL, to address whether IgG4-positive cases have any distinctive characteristics, and to assess whether additional features separating IgM-positive and class-switched cases could be identified, the clinicopathologic features of 26 PCMZL obtained from 19 patients were investigated. Twenty of 26 (77%) PCMZL were heavy chain class-switched (19 IgG-positive, 1 IgA-positive), including 9 that were IgG4-positive (35%). IgG4-positive and other class-switched PCMZL were morphologically similar. IgM-positive cases occurred in older individuals (median: 69 vs. 46.5 y; P=0.0001), more often involved the subcutis (P=0.002), demonstrated plasma cells diffusely scattered versus at the periphery of the lymphoid infiltrate (P=0.005), uniformly showed follicular  (P=0.0001), contained more numerous  cells (P=0.0004), and were more likely to have a T-cell CD4:CD8 ratio of <3:1 (P=0.03). None of the IgM-positive PCMZL harbored a MYD88 L265P mutation. No significant differences in clinical outcome were documented. These results highlight the high frequency of IgG4-positive PCMZL, which are otherwise similar to other class-switched cases, provide additional evidence supporting the distinction between class-switched and IgM-positive cases, and emphasize the indolent nature of at least the class-switched PCMZL, which may warrant their categorization as a clonal chronic lymphoproliferative disorder.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31191547>Therapeutic Protection Against  Infection in Mongolian Gerbils by Oral Immunization With a Tetravalent Epitope-Based Vaccine With Polysaccharide Adjuvant.</a></h2><p>Urease is an effective target for design of a therapeutic epitope vaccine against  (). In our previous studies, an epitope vaccine CTB-UE containing Th and  epitopes from  urease was constructed, and the CTB-UE vaccine could provide therapeutic effect on  infection in mice. However, a multivalent vaccine, combining different antigens participating in different aspects of   and pathogenesis, may be more effective as a therapeutic vaccine than a univalent vaccine targetting urease. Therefore, a multivalent epitope vaccine FVpE, containing Th1-type immune adjuvant NAP, three selected functional fragments from CagA and VacA, and an urease multi-epitope peptide (UE) from CTB-UE, was constructed in this study and expected to obtain better sterilizing immunity than the univalent epitope vaccine CTB-UE. The therapeutic effect of multivalent epitope vaccine FVpE with polysaccharide adjuvant (PA) was evaluated in -infected Mongolian gerbil model. The results showed that both FvpE and CTB-UE vaccine could induce similar levels of specific antibodies against  urease, and had similar inhibition effect on  urease activity. However, only FVpE could induce high levels of specific antibodies to CagA, VacA, and NAP. In addition, oral therapeutic immunization with FVpE plus PA significantly reduced the number of  colonies in the stomach of Mongolian gerbils compared with oral immunization with CTB-UE plus PA, or FVpE only, and the FVpE vaccine with PA even exhibited sterilizing immunity. The protection of FVpE was related to the mixed CD4 T cell responses and epitope-specific antibodies against various  antigens. These results indicate that a multivalent epitope vaccine targetting various  antigens could be a promising candidate against  infection.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31508436>Evaluation of the Antimicrobial and Anti-inflammatory Properties of -DFM (Norum™) in Broiler Chickens Infected With  Enteritidis.</a></h2><p>Restrictions of in-feed antibiotics use in poultry has pushed research toward finding appropriate alternatives such as Direct-Fed Microbials (DFM).

For this purpose, initial antibacterial activity of -DFM (10 spores/g or 10 spores/g) against . Enteritidis  in crop, proventriculus and intestine was investigated using an  digestive model. Furthermore, to evaluate therapeutic and prophylactic effects of -DFM (10 spores/g) against . Enteritidis , altogether 60 ( = 30/group) and 30 ( = 15/group) 1-day-old broiler chickens were randomly allocated to either DFM or control group (without -DFM), respectively. Chickens were orally gavaged with 10 cfu of . Enteritidis per chicken at 1-day old, and cecal tonsils (CT) and crop were collected 3 and 10 days later during the therapeutic study, whereas they were orally gavaged with 10 cfu of . Enteritidis per chicken at 6-day-old, and CT and crop were collected 24 h later from two independent trials during the prophylactic study. Serum superoxide dismutase (SOD), FITC-d and intestinal IgA levels were reported for both chicken studies, in addition cecal microbiota analysis was performed during the therapeutic study. DFM significantly reduced . Enteritidis concentration in the intestine compartment, and in both proventriculus and intestine compartments as compared to the control when used at 10 spores/g and 10 spores/g, respectively ( < 0.05). DFM significantly reduced FITC-d and IgA as well as SOD and IgA levels ( < 0.05) compared to the control in therapeutic and prophylactic studies, respectively. Interestingly, in the therapeutic study, there were significant differences in bacterial community structure and predicted metabolic pathways between DFM and control. Likewise, phylum  and the genera , and cc_115 were decreased, while the genus  was enriched significantly in the DFM group as compared to the control (MetagenomeSeq,  < 0.05).

Inpatients with HS had higher prevalences of infections overall (excluding cellulitis and erysipelas) than those with psoriasis, but lower than those with atopic dermatitis. In multivariable logistic regression models adjusting for sociodemographics, HS was associated with 18 of 45 infections examined (adults: 16 of 45; children: six of 45), including acute infections (herpes simplex virus, herpes zoster, necrotizing fasciitis, septicaemia, bone infection, Clostridium difficile, methicillin-sensitive and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus, Pseudomonas, mycobacterial, fungal, viral), chronic infections (HIV, hepatitis ) and antibiotic-resistant infections. HS alone was associated with increased infections. Patients with comorbid cancer; HIV; cardiometabolic, autoimmune or mental health diagnoses or acne had even higher odds of infections. Inpatients with HS with vs. without serious infection had increased inpatient mortality (0·71% vs. 0·16%), mean length of stay (7·3 vs. 4·8 days) and cost of care (US$13 578 vs. $9242), with a mean annual excess 41 050 days and $71 622 339 cost of hospitalization.Adults and children with HS had increased acute and chronic, cutaneous, extracutaneous and systemic infections, which were associated with increased mortality and cost.© 2019 British Association of Dermatologists.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31433298> cell receptor and Toll-like receptor signaling coordinate to control distinct -1 responses to both self and the microbiota.</a></h2><p>-1a cells play an important role in mediating tissue homeostasis and protecting against infections. They are the main producers of 'natural' IgM, spontaneously secreted serum antibodies predominately reactive to self antigens, like phosphatidylcholine (PtC), or antigens expressed by the intestinal microbiota. The mechanisms that regulate the -1a immunoglobulin (Ig) repertoire and their antibody secretion remain poorly understood. Here, we use a novel reporter mouse to demonstrate that production of self- and microbiota-reactive antibodies is linked to BCR signaling in -1a cells. Moreover, we show that Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are critical for shaping the Ig repertoire of -1a cells as well as regulating their antibody production. Strikingly, we find that both the  of a microbiota as well as microbial-sensing TLRs are required for anti-microbiota -1a responses, whereas nucleic-acid sensing TLRs are required for anti-PtC responses, demonstrating that linked activation of BCR and TLRs controls steady state -1a responses to both self and microbiota-derived antigens.© 2019, Kreuk et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31340603>In Vivo Assessment of VCAM-1 Expression by SPECT/CT Imaging in Mice Models of Human Triple Negative Breast Cancer.</a></h2><p>Recent progress in breast cancer research has led to the identification of Vascular Cell Adhesion Molecule-1 (VCAM-1) as a key actor of metastatic . VCAM-1 promotes lung-metastases and is associated with clinical early recurrence and poor outcome in triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). Our objective was to perform the in vivo imaging of VCAM-1 in mice models of TNBC. The Cancer Genomic Atlas (TCGA) database was analyzed to evaluate the prognostic role of VCAM-1 in TNBC. MDA-MB-231 (VCAM-1+) and control HCC70 (VCAM-1-) TNBC cells were subcutaneously xenografted in mice and VCAM-1 expression was assessed in vivo by single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging using Tc-cAbVCAM1-5. Then, MDA-MB-231 cells were intravenously injected in mice and VCAM-1 expression in lung metastasis was assessed by SPECT imaging after 8 weeks. TCGA analysis showed that VCAM-1 is associated with a poor prognosis in TNBC patients. In subcutaneous tumor models, Tc-cAbVCAM1-5 uptake was 2-fold higher in MDA-MB-231 than in HCC70 ( < 0.01), and 4-fold higher than that of the irrelevant control ( < 0.01). Moreover, Tc-cAbVCAM1-5 uptake in MDA-MB-231 lung metastases was also higher than that of Tc-Ctl ( < 0.05). Tc-cAbVCAM1-5 is therefore a suitable tool to evaluate the role of VCAM-1 as a marker of tumor aggressiveness of TNBC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31427616>Isolation-by-environment as a driver of genetic differentiation among populations of the only broad-leaved evergreen shrub Ammopiptanthus mongolicus in Asian temperate deserts.</a></h2><p>Whether the effect of migration-selection-drift equilibrium on population structure is governed by spatial or environmental differences is usually elucidated by isolation-by-distance (IBD), isolation-by-environment (IBE), and isolation-by-resistance (IBR) tests. The population structure of Ammopiptanthus mongolicus, a broad-leaved evergreen psammophyte in eastern Central Asia, was previously thought to follow an isolation by distance pattern. However, recent studies have emphasized the effects of environmental factors on its growth and distribution, suggesting an important influence of local adaptation on the genetic structure of the species. Using inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR) markers, we verified the previously inferred low intra-population variation and high inter-population differentiation. However, in contrast to previous studies, the results of partial Mantel tests and a maximum likelihood population effects mixed model (MLPE) suggested that local climate differences, rather than geographic distances or resistance distances, are the main factor affecting population differentiation. Further analysis with removal of multicollinear climatic variables and univariate MLPE found that summer and winter precipitation were crucial for shaping the current population genetic structure. Since local precipitation is related to the regeneration, , and overwintering survival of A. mongolicus, its influence on demographic change may explain its effect on the population genetic structure. In addition, precipitation is related to terrain despite westward decreases, which explains the independence of genetic difference and geographic distance. The identified role of IBE suggests that collecting germplasm resources from genetically differentiated populations could be a more effective strategy to preserve the overall genetic diversity of the species than the establishment of corridors to enhance gene flow among populations.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31145503>Adaptation of the group A Streptococcus adhesin Scl1 to bind fibronectin type III repeats within wound-associated extracellular matrix: implications for cancer therapy.</a></h2><p>The human-adapted pathogen group A Streptococcus (GAS) utilizes wounds as portals of entry into host tissue, wherein surface adhesins interact with the extracellular matrix, enabling bacterial . The streptococcal collagen-like protein 1 (Scl1) is a major adhesin of GAS that selectively binds to two fibronectin type III (FnIII) repeats within cellular fibronectin, specifically the alternatively spliced extra domains A and , and the FnIII repeats within tenascin-C. Binding to FnIII repeats was mediated through conserved structural determinants present within the Scl1 globular domain and facilitated GAS adherence and biofilm formation. Isoforms of cellular fibronectin that contain extra domains A and , as well as tenascin-C, are present for several days in the wound extracellular matrix. Scl1-FnIII binding is therefore an example of GAS adaptation to the host's wound environment. Similarly, cellular fibronectin isoforms and tenascin-C are present in the tumor microenvironment. Consistent with this, FnIII repeats mediate GAS attachment to and enhancement of biofilm formation on matrices deposited by cancer-associated fibroblasts and osteosarcoma cells. These data collectively support the premise for utilization of the Scl1-FnIII interaction as a novel method of anti-neoplastic targeting in the tumor microenvironment.© 2019 The Authors.

Eradication and acquisition during ICU stay of 3GCR-E and CR-GNB were investigated separately in the rectum and respiratory tract for the three interventions and compared with standard care (SC) using Cox-regression competing events analyses.Adjusted cause specific hazard ratios (CSHR) for eradication of rectal carriage for SDD were 1.76 (95% CI 1.31-2.36) for 3GCR-E and 3.17 (95% CI 1.60-6.29) for CR-GNB compared with SC. For the respiratory tract, adjusted CSHR for eradication of 3GCR-E were 1.47 (0.98-2.20) for SDD and 1.38 (0.92-2.06) for SOD compared with SC, and for eradication of CR-GNB these were 0.77 (0.41- 1.45) for SDD and 0.81 (0.44-1.51) for SOD, compared with SC. Adjusted CSHRs for acquisition of rectal carriage during SDD (compared with SC) were 0.51 (0.40-0.64) for 3GCR-E and of 0.56 (0.40-0.78) for CR-GNB. Adjusted CSHRs for acquiring respiratory tract carriage with 3GCR-E compared with SC were 0.38 (0.28-0.50) for SDD and 0.55 (0.42-0.71) for SOD, and for CR-GNB 0.46 (0.33-0.64) during SDD and 0.60 (0.44-0.81) during SOD, respectively. SOD was not associated with eradication or acquisition of 3GCR-E and CR-GNB in the rectum.Among mechanically ventilated ICU patients, SDD was associated with more eradication and less acquisition of 3GCR-E and CR-GNB in the rectum than SC. SDD and SOD were associated with less acquisition of both 3GCR-E and CR-GNB than SC in the respiratory tract.Copyright © 2019 European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases.

The prevalence of M. hyorhinis  in sows was low (<5%). No associations were found between sow parity or sow serum titer and piglet nasal  at either birth or weaning. In contrast to the low prevalence (0.95-2.70%) observed in piglets pre-weaning, most pigs became colonized during the first four weeks after weaning and remained positive throughout the nursery and finishing stages. The detection of M. hyorhinis in oral fluids followed similar patterns as those observed using nasal swabs.

Th1/17-polarized immune responses correlate with long-lasting protection against bordetellae and other respiratory pathogens. Notably, BcfA strongly attenuated the Th2 responses elicited by FHA and Prn, resulting in Th1/17-skewed responses in inherently Th2-skewed BALB/c mice. Thus, BcfA functions as both an antigen and an adjuvant, providing protection as a single-component vaccine.

"FlaA + FlaB + PilA" induced greater protection in P. aeruginosa murine burn model than the single components alone, and it showed broad immune protection against P. aeruginosa strains. Immunization with "FlaA + FlaB + PilA" induced strong opsonophagocytic antibodies and resulted in reduced bacterial loads, systemic IL-12/IL-10 cytokine expression, and increased survival after challenge with three times lethal dose fifty (LD50) of P. eruginosa strains. Moreover, the protective efficacy of "FlaA + FlaB + PilA" vaccination was largely attributed to specific antibodies. Taken together, these data further confirm that the protective effects of "FlaA + FlaB + PilA" vaccine significantly enhance efficacy compared with antibodies against either mono or divalent antigen, and that the former broadens the coverage against P. eruginosa strains that express two of the three antigens.Copyright © 2019.

Here, we describe the formation of carbohydrate functionalized glass surfaces with D-glucose, D-galactose and D-mannose and how they efficiently affected the bacterial attachment. The carbohydrate entities were covalently attached to the pre-functionalized surface by click chemistry thanks the copper catalysed alkyl-azide cycloaddition. Water contact angle and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy characterisations showed a homogeneous and quantitative cycloaddition at the scale of microorganisms. The adhesion assays with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, used as model of opportunistic pathogen, indicated a significant diminution of almost 40% of the bacterial accumulation on glycosidic surfaces with respect to initial surface. This activity was further compared with a surface presenting a simple hydroxyl residue. Exploration of specific interactions through Lectin A deficient Pseudomonas aeruginosa mutant strain provided new evidences that Lectin A was involved in biofilm maturation, rather than bacterial attachment. Subsequently, the determination of surface free energy and the adhesion free energy between surfaces and bacterial cell wall showed that the adhesion was thermodynamically unfavourable.Copyright © 2019.

Among the important phenotypic modifications is the variation of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) structure at level of the O-antigen (OAg) presence, influencing adherence,  and the ability to evade the host defense mechanisms. The present study was performed to understand whether the loss of OAg expression during CF infection can be considered a general phenomenon in different Bcc species favoring its chronicity. In fact, it is still not clear why different Bcc species/strains differ in their ability to persist in the CF lung and pathogenic potential. The systematic two-decade-retrospective-longitudinal-screening conducted covered 357 isolates retrieved from 19 chronically infected patients receiving care at a central hospital in Lisbon. The study involved 21 Bcc strains of six/seven Bcc species/lineages, frequently or rarely isolated from CF patients worldwide. Different strains/clonal variants obtained during infection gave rise to characteristic OAg-banding patterns. The two most prevalent and feared species,  and , showed a tendency to lose the OAg along chronic infection. .  lineage IIIA strains known to lead to particularly destructive infections exhibit the most frequent OAg loss, compared with lineage IIIB. The switch frequency increased with the duration of infection and the level of lung function deterioration. For the first time, it is shown that the rarely found  and , whose representation in the cohort of patients examined is abnormally high, keep the OAg even during 10- or 15-year infections. Data from co-infections with different Bcc species reinforced these conclusions. Concerning the two other rarely found species examined, .  exhibited a stable OAg expression phenotype over the infection period while for the single clone of the more distantly related .  species, the OAg-chain was absent from the beginning of the 5.5-year infection until the patient dead.

A significant number of women in the United States receive either inadequate prenatal care or inadequate screening for these pathogens. The time of admission to labor and delivery units represents an important opportunity to detect at-risk pregnant women and infants. To optimize both maternal and neonatal health, the Joint Commission issued new guidance effective July 1, 2018, mandating documentation of maternal disease status for these pathogens in the maternal medical record and documentation of positive results in the newborn medical record.

To prevent maternal GBS vaginal , new antibiotic-free approaches, based on lactobacilli probiotics, are advisable. The aim of this study was to assess the anti-GBS activity of 14 vaginal Lactobacillus strains, belonging to different species (L. crispatus, L. gasseri, L. vaginalis), isolated from healthy pre-menopausal women. In particular, we performed 'inhibition' experiments, evaluating the ability of both Lactobacillus cells and culture supernatants in reducing Streptococcus viability, after 60 min contact time. First, we demonstrated that the acidic milieu, produced by vaginal lactobacilli metabolism, is crucial in counteracting GBS growth in a pH-dependent manner. Experiments with organic/inorganic acid solutions confirmed the strict correlation between pH levels and the anti-GBS activity. GBS was more sensitive to lactic acid than to hydrochloric acid, indicating that the presence of H ions is necessary but not sufficient for the inhibitory activity. Moreover, experiments with Lactobacillus pH-adjusted supernatants led to exclude a direct role in the anti-GBS activity by other bioactive molecules. Second, we found that only a few Lactobacillus strains were able to reduce Streptococcus viability by means of cell pellets. The anti-GBS effect displayed by Lactobacillus cells was related to the their ability to interact and aggregate with Streptococcus cells. We found that the anti-GBS activity was retained after methanol/proteinase K treatment, but lost after lysozyme exposure of Lactobacillus cells. Therefore, we supposed that non-proteinaceous components of Lactobacillus cell wall could be responsible for the anti-GBS activity. In conclusion, we identified specific Lactobacillus strains able to interfere with GBS viability by multiple strategies and we elucidated some of the mechanisms of action. These strains could serve as probiotic formulations for the prevention of GBS vaginal .Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

AR bacteria can be acquired in early life and have long-term sequelae. Limiting the spread of antibiotic resistance without triggering the development of additional resistance mechanisms is of immense clinical value. Here, we show how the infant gut microbiome can be modified, resulting in a significant reduction of AR genes (ARGs) and the potentially pathogenic bacteria that harbor them.The gut microbiome was characterized using shotgun metagenomics of fecal samples from two groups of healthy, term breastfed infants. One group was fed  EVC001 in addition to receiving lactation support ( = 29, EVC001-fed), while the other received lactation support alone ( = 31, controls).

However, the mechanisms of severe pneumonia with postinfluenza Streptococcus pneumoniae (SP) secondary infection have not been fully understood. In this study, we explored the mechanisms of pneumonia in postinfluenza A virus (IAV) infection via a mouse model. Mice were intranasally inoculated with SP three days after IAV inoculation. We then collected samples at three time points to dynamically observe the pathological progression. In IAV infection alone, lymphocyte infiltration and widened alveolar intervals were observed. In the blood, levels of the CD19+, CD19+CD21+ and CD19+CD79β+ lymphocyte subpopulations were reduced, and IFN-γ and IL-10 were elevated. Slight atrophy was seen in the spleen, which was due to splenic  lymphocyteinitiated apoptosis through the mitochondrial pathway. When SP infection occurred after IAV infection, the pulmonary inflammation was significantly aggravated; a fair number of lymphocytes and neutrophils infiltrated simultaneously with exfoliated bronchial epithelial cells, vascular endothelial cells, widened alveolar septum and hemorrhaging. Increasing edema fluid and bacteria accumulated in the alveolar cavity. Decreased CD19+, CD19+CD21+ and CD19+CD79β+ lymphocyte subpopulations and increased interferon gamma (IFN-γ) or interleukin 10 (IL-10) were more prominent compared to those with viral infection alone. Spleen atrophy resulting from coinfection was more obvious because of massive splenic  lymphocyte apoptosis through the mitochondrial pathway compared to viral infection alone. This study shows that although inflammation caused by SP infection alone was temporary, preceding IAV infection provided favorable conditions for SP  and multiplication by destroying lung structure and suppressing humoral immunity. Synergistic IAV-SP coinfection is likely to facilitate more SP  and promote  lymphocyte-suppression and reduction.

It was found that the application of MeJA (>100 mg L) inhibits the germination of  spores under controlled laboratory conditions. To assess the effect of MeJA (150 mg L) in combination with the biocontrol agent  UBSTH-501 , a green house experiment was conducted. For this, biocontrol agent  UBSTH-501 was applied as seed treatment, whereas MeJA (150 mg L) was applied 5 days prior to pathogen inoculation. Results indicated that application of MeJA (150 mg L) did not affect the root  of wheat by  UBSTH-501 in the rhizosphere. The combined application of  UBSTH-501 and MeJA also enhanced indole acetic acid production in the rhizosphere (4.92 μg g of soil) which in turn helps in plant growth and development. Further, the combined application found to enhance the activities of defense related enzymes  catalase (5.92 EU min g fresh wt.), ascorbate peroxidase [μmol ascorbate oxidized (mg prot) min], phenylalanine ammonia lyase (102.25 μmol cinnamic acid h mg fresh wt.) and peroxidase (6.95 Unit mg min fresh wt.) significantly in the plants under treatment which was further confirmed by assessing the transcript level of  and  genes using semi-quantitative PCR approach. The results showed manifold increase in salicylic acid (SA) along with enhanced accumulation of total free phenolics, ferulic acid, caffeic acid, coumaric acid, and chlorogenic acid in the leaves of the plants treated with the biocontrol agent alone or in combination with MeJA. A significant decrease in the disease severity (17.46%) and area under disease progress curve (630.32) were also observed in the treatments with biocontrol agent and MeJA in combination as compared to  alone treated plant (56.95% and 945.50, respectively). Up-regulation of phenylpropanoid cascades in response to exogenous application of MeJA and the biocontrol agent was observed. It was depicted from the results that PAL is the primary route for lignin production in wheat which reduces cell wall disruption and tissue disintegration and increases suberization and lignification of the plant cell as seen by Scanning Electron microphotographs. These results clearly indicated that exogenous application of MeJA with  inducing JA- and/or SA-dependent defense signaling after pathogen challenge may increase the resistance to spot blotch by stimulating enzymatic activities and the accumulation of phenolic compounds in a cooperative manner.

Most members of the root microbiome possess microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) similar to those of plant pathogens [2]. Their recognition can lead to the activation of host immunity and suppression of plant growth due to growth-defense tradeoffs [3, 4]. We found that 42% of the tested root microbiota, including the plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria Pseudomonas capeferrum WCS358 [5, 6] and Pseudomonas simiae WCS417 [6, 7], are able to quench local Arabidopsis thaliana root immune responses that are triggered by flg22 [8], an immunogenic epitope of the MAMP flagellin [9], suggesting that this is an important function of the root microbiome. In a screen for WCS358 mutants that lost their capacity to suppress flg22-induced CYP71A12:GUS MAMP-reporter gene expression, we identified the bacterial genes pqqF and cyoB in WCS358, which are required for the production of gluconic acid and its derivative 2-keto gluconic acid. Both WCS358 mutants are impaired in the production of these organic acids and consequently lowered their extracellular pH to a lesser extent than wild-type WCS358. Acidification of the plant growth medium similarly suppressed flg22-induced CYP71A12:GUS and MYB51:GUS expression, and the flg22-mediated oxidative burst, suggesting a role for rhizobacterial gluconic acid-mediated modulation of the extracellular pH in the suppression of root immunity. Rhizosphere population densities of the mutants were significantly reduced compared to wild-type. Collectively, these findings show that suppression of immune responses is an important function of the root microbiome, as it facilitates  by beneficial root microbiota.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

In addition to coding sequence divergence, variation in gene expression may relate to variable heat tolerance, and can impose ecological barriers within species. Temperature plays a significant role in aquatic ecosystems by affecting species abundance, spatio-temporal distribution, and habitat . Recently described (formerly cryptic) species of the Brachionus calyciflorus complex exhibit different temperature tolerance both in natural and in laboratory studies, and show that . calyciflorus sensu stricto (s.s.) is a thermotolerant species. Even within . calyciflorus s.s., there is a tendency for further temperature specializations. Comparison of expressed genes allows us to assess the impact of stressors on both expression and sequence divergence among disparate populations within a single species. Here, we have used RNA-seq to explore expressed genetic diversity in . calyciflorus s.s. in two mitochondrial DNA lineages with different phylogenetic histories and differences in thermotolerance. We identify a suite of candidate genes that may underlie local adaptation, with a particular focus on the response to sustained high or low temperatures. We do not find adaptive divergence in established candidate genes for thermal adaptation. Rather, we detect divergent selection among our two lineages in genes related to metabolism (lipid metabolism, metabolism of xenobiotics).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31480903>Fungi form interkingdom microbial communities in the primordial human gut that develop with gestational age.</a></h2><p>Fungal and bacterial commensal organisms play a complex role in the health of the human host. Expansion of commensal ecology after birth is a critical period in human immune development. However, the initial fungal  of the primordial gut remains undescribed. To investigate primordial fungal ecology, we performed amplicon sequencing and culture-based techniques of first-pass meconium, which forms in the intestine prior to birth, from a prospective observational cohort of term and preterm newborns. Here, we describe fungal ecologies in the primordial gut that develop complexity with advancing gestational age at birth. Our findings suggest homeostasis of fungal commensals may represent an important aspect of human biology present even before birth. Unlike bacterial communities that gradually develop complexity, the domination of the fungal communities of some preterm infants by Saccromycetes, specifically , may suggest a pathologic association with preterm birth.-Willis, K.

The reason for FrMLV sensitivity of -1 cells and their impact on viral spread is unknown. Here we demonstrate that Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) sensing and type I interferon (IFN-I) signaling in -1 cells contribute to FrMLV susceptibility. FrMLV infection in -1 cell-deficient mice (; IκBNS dysfunctional) was significantly lower than that in the wild-type mice and was rescued by adoptive transfer of wild-type -1 cells. This rescue of FrMLV infection in  mice was dependent on intact TLR7 sensing and IFN-I signaling within -1 cells. Analyses of infected cell types revealed that the reduced infection in  mice was due predominantly to compromised virus spread to the -2 cell population. Our data reveal how FrMLV exploits innate immune sensing and activation in the -1 cell population for infection and subsequent spread to other lymphocytes. Viruses establish infection in hosts by targeting highly permissive cell types. The retrovirus Friend murine leukemia virus (FrMLV) infects a subtype of  cells called -1 cells that permit robust virus replication. The reason for their susceptibility had remained unknown. We found that innate sensing of incoming virus and the ensuing type I interferon response within -1 cells are responsible for their observed susceptibility. Our data provide insights into how retroviruses coevolved with the host to co-opt innate immune sensing pathways designed to fight virus infections for establishing infection. Understanding early events in viral spread can inform antiviral intervention strategies that prevent the  of a host.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31503161>Antibiotic Use Without Indication During Delivery Hospitalizations in the United States.</a></h2><p>To analyze trends in unindicated antibiotic use during vaginal delivery hospitalization.This study used an administrative database to analyze antibiotic use during delivery hospitalizations from January 2006 to March 2015. Women were classified by mode of delivery and whether they had an evidence-based indication for antibiotics. Indications for antibiotics included preterm prelabor rupture of membranes (PROM), cesarean delivery, group  streptococcus (GBS) , chorioamnionitis, endometritis, urinary tract infections, and other infections. The Cochran-Armitage test was used to assess trends of antibiotic administration. Unadjusted and adjusted analyses for antibiotic receipt including demographic, hospital, and obstetric and medical factors were performed with unadjusted and adjusted risk ratios (RRs) with 95% CIs as measures of association.A total of 5,536,756 delivery hospitalizations, including 2,872,286 vaginal deliveries without an indication for antibiotics, were analyzed. The most common indication for antibiotics was cesarean delivery (33.6% of the entire cohort), followed by GBS  (15.8%), chorioamnionitis (1.7%), preterm PROM (1.6%), endometritis (1.2%), urinary tract infections (0.6%), and other infections (total less than 0.5%). The proportion of women receiving unindicated antibiotics decreased 44.4%, from 38.1% in 2006 to 21.2% in 2015. Adjusted risk for receipt of unindicated antibiotics was lower in 2015 vs 2006 (adjusted RR 0.56, 95% CI 0.55-0.57).Use of antibiotics during vaginal delivery hospitalizations without an indication for antibiotic use declined significantly based on an analysis of a large administrative data set.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31290544>Predictors of Clostridioidesdifficile Infection among Asymptomatic Colonized Patients: A Retrospective Cohort Study.</a></h2><p>Asymptomatic patients colonized with Clostridioides difficile are at risk of developing C. difficile infection (CDI), but factors associated with disease onset are poorly understood. Our aims were to identify predictors of hospital-onset CDI (HO-CDI) among colonized patients, and explore the potential benefit of primary prophylaxis to prevent CDI.Retrospective cohort study in a tertiary academic institution. Colonized patients were identified by detecting the tcdB gene by PCR on a rectal swab. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to identify predictors of HO-CDI.19,112 patients were screened, 960 (5%) colonized patients were identified and 513 met the inclusion criteria. Overall, 39 (7.6%) developed a HO-CDI, with a 30-day attributable mortality of 15%. An increasing length of stay (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] per day, 1.03; p=0.006), exposure to multiple classes of antibiotics (aOR per class, 1.45; p=0.02), use of opioids (aOR, 2.78; p=0.007), and cirrhosis (aOR 5.49; p=0.008), were independently associated with an increased risk of HO-CDI, whereas the use of laxatives was associated with a lower risk of CDI (aOR 0.36; p=0.01). Among the antimicrobials, -lactam with -lactamase inhibitors (OR 3.65; p<0.001), first generation cephalosporins (OR 2.38; p=0.03), and carbapenems (OR 2.44; p=0.03) correlated with the greatest risk of HO-CDI. By contrast, patient age, proton pump inhibitors and the use of primary prophylaxis were not significant predictors of HO-CDI.This study identifies several factors that are associated with CDI among colonized patients. Whether modifying these variables could decrease the risk of CDI should be investigated.© The Author(s) 2019. Published by Oxford University Press for the Infectious Diseases Society of America.

In cattle, it is considered an udder-specific pathogen and a common cause of mastitis. Here we investigated the host specificity of GBS by examining their  at various anatomical sites in both cattle and humans, as well as the possible cross-species transmission in closed barn environments. We collected more than 800 swab samples from dairy cows and herdspersons at eight dairy farms in Denmark. GBS was isolated from 12% of the samples. The GBS strains (N = 105) were characterized by biochemical test, serology, and Pulsed-Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE). Based on the PFGE patterns, 25 strains were selected for whole genome sequencing followed by phylogenetic analyses. The genomes were compared to each other and to a collection of publicly available GBS genomes. The study revealed that GBS clones were shared by cows and herdspersons. In phylogenetic analyses, these shared clones clustered with GBS strains from persons with no relation to farming. Horizontal cross-species transmission of the contagion in both directions was found to be highly likely within the same environment; thus, some cases of bovine mastitis are probably antrophonotic.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

It also enlightens our understanding on the host-microbe interactions within the physiological context of a living host. However, the responses of GF zebrafish to various  conditions such as bacterial concentrations,  time points, and exposure duration remain unclear. To address this issue, we explored the responses of GF zebrafish by using two bacterial species at varying concentrations,  time points and exposure duration. Therefore, we mono-associated GF zebrafish with  DH5α or  WB800N at concentrations ranging from 10 to 10 CFU/ml either at 3 day post fertilization (dpf) or 5 dpf for 24 or 48 h. We evaluated the responses of GF zebrafish by analyzing the survival rate,  efficiency, nutrients metabolism, intestinal cell proliferation, innate immunity, stress, and behavior responses by comparing it to conventionally raised zebrafish (CONR) and GF zebrafish. The results indicated that the final bacteria concentrations ranging from 10 to 10 CFU/ml did not cause any mortality when GF mono-associated larvae were exposed to either  DH5α or  WB800N at 3 or 5 dpf, while concentrations ranging from 10 to 10 CFU/ml increased the mortality, particularly for 5 dpf owing to the decrease in dissolved oxygen level. The  DH5α mainly induced the expression of genes related to nutrients metabolism, cell proliferation and immunity, while  WB800N mainly upregulated the expression of genes related to immunity and stress responses. Moreover, our data revealed that GF zebrafish showed higher levels of physical activity than CONR and the microbial  reduced the hyperactivity of GF zebrafish, suggesting  of bacteria affected behavior characteristics.

Less information is available about microbiotas in Asian countries, where environmental, nutritional, and cultural influences may differentially affect the composition and development of the microbial community. We compared the fecal microbiotas of Indonesian ( = 204) and New Zealand (NZ) ( = 74) infants 6 to 7 months and 12 months of age. Comparisons were made by analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences and derivation of community diversity metrics, relative abundances of bacterial families, enterotypes, and cooccurrence correlation networks. Abundances of  subsp.  and  subsp.  were determined by quantitative PCR. All observations supported the view that the Indonesian and NZ infant microbiotas developed in complexity over time, but the changes were much greater for NZ infants.  subsp.  dominated the microbiotas of Indonesian children, whereas  subsp.  was dominant in NZ children. Network analysis showed that the niche model (in which trophic adaptation results in preferential ) of the assemblage of microbiotas was supported in Indonesian infants, whereas the neutral (stochastic) model was supported by the development of the microbiotas of NZ infants. The results of the study show that the development of the fecal microbiota is not the same for infants in all countries, and they point to the necessity of obtaining a better understanding of the factors that control the  of the gut in early life. This study addresses the microbiology of a natural ecosystem (the infant bowel) for children in a rural setting in Indonesia and in an urban environment in New Zealand. Analysis of DNA sequences generated from the microbial community (microbiota) in the feces of the infants during the first year of life showed marked differences in the composition and complexity of the bacterial collections. The differences were most likely due to differences in the prevalence and duration of breastfeeding of infants in the two countries. These kinds of studies are essential for developing concepts of microbial ecology related to the influence of nutrition and environment on the development of the gut microbiota and for determining the long-term effects of microbiological events in early life on human health and well-being.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31362856>Function and regulation of Staphylococcus aureus wall teichoic acids and capsular polysaccharides.</a></h2><p>Staphylococcus aureus produces different secondary cell wall glycopolymers such as wall teichoic acids (WTA) and capsular polysaccharides (CP). These structures play an important role in S. aureus , pathogenesis and bacterial evasion of the host immune defences. To fulfil their diverse functions, biosynthesis of both glycopolymers has to be tightly controlled. Regulation of WTA biosynthesis and modification is only partially understood. The transcription factor MgrA and the two-component systems (TCS) Agr, GraRS, and ArlRS control WTA export, chain-length and modification. CP synthesis is determined by transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulatory circuits. On the transcriptional level expression of the capA-P operon is mainly driven by the alternative Sigma factor  and modulated by several transcriptional factors and TCS. Post-transcriptional mechanisms are in place to avoid conflict between precursor usage by the CP synthesis machinery and the synthesis machinery of other cell wall glycopolymers. The complex interplay of these regulatory systems determines the peculiar, strictly temporal expression of CP in the late growth phase and the high degree of phenotypic heterogeneity. Differential expression of CP, WTA and its modification systems during infection and colonisation are likely important for disease development, immune escape and survival within the host.Copyright © 2019.

Recently, these natural approaches, which are based on surface nanotopography, have been mimicked to fabricate a modern antibacterial surface. In this vein, use of nanoparticle (NP) technology has been explored in order to create a suitable antibacterial surface. However, few studies have focused on the toxicity of these techniques and the ecotoxicity of NP materials on mammalian and bacterial cells simultaneously. Researchers have observed that the majority of previous studies have demonstrated some of the extents of the harmful impacts on mammalian cells.

The multiple social inequalities, and therefore the constant insecurities for many about low income, poor living conditions, unemployment, and discrimination, generate chronic stress in this population. In the Baby Teeth Talk Study, an oral-health randomized controlled trial, the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-14) was administered to 367 pregnant Aboriginal women at baseline. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the validity and reliability of the PSS-14 in an Aboriginal population. The study analysed: (a) model fit; () dimensionality; (c) local dependence; (d) differential item functioning; (e) threshold ordering and item fit; (f) targeting; (g) reliability; and (h) criterion validity. The dimensionality analysis indicated a two-factor structure, with negatively and positively worded items clustering together and 21.7% (95% Agresti-Coull C.I. [17.8%, 26.2%]) statistically significant t-tests between the persons' estimates. After the creation of composite items, the revised Perceived Distress (χ2 (21) = 11.74, p = 0.946) and Perceived Coping (χ2 (28) = 17.63, p = 0.935) subscales fitted the Rasch model. Reliability was modest (PersonSeparationIndexdistress = 0.72; PersonSeparationIndexcoping = 0.76). The latent correlation between the Perceived Distress and Perceived Coping subscales was r = 0.14. It is hypothesized that the social inequalities experienced by the Aboriginal population are so pronounced that even Aboriginal pregnant women that perceived themselves as coping well with life challenges ended up endorsing items regarding high levels of stress. The present research showed that a revised PSS-14 is a culturally valid and modestly reliable psychological instrument to measure stress in a population of pregnant Aboriginal women in Australia.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31506230>Recurrence of group  streptococcal meningitis.</a></h2><p>Group  Streptococcus is the most frequent cause of neonatal sepsis.

Which interactions exist with other microbiomes and which conclusions can be drawn for wound management?Swabs or debridement samples from wounds were analysed for microbial growth by culture or gene-based techniques. The genetic results are used to determine the wound microbiome. The pathogens were evaluated according to proportion of different species and related to different factors like type and location of wound, disease and underlying illnesses and to define the wound microbiome.In comparison with conventional microbiological detection methods the wound microbiome comprises many more types and quantities of species. The wound microbiome is related to skin microbiome showing complex and time-dependent composition, as well as inter- and intraindividual differences. Diabetic wounds exhibit disease-related changes, e.g. staphylococcal species dominate whereas streptococcal species dominate in nondiabetic wounds.The analysis of wound microbiome is still at an early stage; however it has already been shown that in hemodynamic disorders there are disease-specific relationships with the wound microbiome, which can also provide clues about the course of the disease.

Understanding how this pathogen responds to the environmental changes and adapts to different niches found inside the host might contribute to gain insight into bacterial pathogenesis. Comparative analyses of previous transcriptomic and proteomic data suggested that post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms modulate . pertussis virulence in response to iron availability. Iron scarcity represents one of the major stresses faced by bacterial pathogens inside the host. In this study, we used gel-free nanoLC-MS/MS-based proteomics to investigate whether Hfq, a highly conserved post-transcriptional regulatory protein, is involved in . pertussis adaptation to low iron environment. To this end, we compared the protein profiles of wild type . pertussis and its isogenic hfq deletion mutant strain under iron-replete and iron-depleted conditions. Almost of 33% of the proteins identified under iron starvation was found to be Hfq-dependent. Among them, proteins involved in oxidative stress tolerance and virulence factors that play a key role in the early steps of host  and bacterial persistence inside the host cells. Altogether these results suggest that Hfq shapes the infective phenotype of . pertussis. SIGNIFICANCE: In the last years, it became evident that post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression in ba cteria plays a central role in host-pathogen interactions. Hfq is a bacterial protein that regulates gene expression at post-transcriptional level found pivotal in the establishment of successful infections. In this study, we investigated the role of Hfq in Bordetella pertussis response to iron starvation, one of the main stresses imposed by the host. The data demonstrate that Hfq regulates the abundance of a significant number of . pertussis proteins in response to iron starvation. Among them, virulence factors and proteins involved in oxidative stress tolerance, key players in host  and intracellular bacterial survival. Altogether, our results suggest a relevant role of Hfq in . pertussis adaptation to the different niches found inside the host eventually granting bacterial pathogenesis.Copyright © 2018.

The primary risk factor for neonatal GBS early-onset disease (EOD) is maternal  of the genitourinary and gastrointestinal tracts. Approximately 50% of women who are colonized with GBS will transmit the bacteria to their newborns. Vertical transmission usually occurs during labor or after rupture of membranes. In the absence of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis, 1- 2% of those newborns will develop GBS EOD. Other risk factors include gestational age of less than 37 weeks, very low birth weight, prolonged rupture of membranes, intraamniotic infection, young maternal age, and maternal black race. The key obstetric measures necessary for effective prevention of GBS EOD continue to include universal prenatal screening by vaginal-rectal culture, correct specimen collection and processing, appropriate implementation of intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis, and coordination with pediatric care providers. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists now recommends performing universal GBS screening between 36 0/7 and 37 6/7 weeks of gestation. All women whose vaginal-rectal cultures at 36 0/7-37 6/7 weeks of gestation are positive for GBS should receive appropriate intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis unless a prelabor cesarean birth is performed in the setting of intact membranes. Although a shorter duration of recommended intrapartum antibiotics is less effective than 4 or more hours of prophylaxis, 2 hours of antibiotic exposure has been shown to reduce GBS vaginal colony counts and decrease the frequency of a clinical neonatal sepsis diagnosis.

Further enhancement of SA-dependent defense responses such as lignification to the combined infection was shown to reduce the level of induced JA-dependent defense against subsequent infection with  var. . Altogether, our results demonstrate how the hexaploid monocot wheat responds to beneficial or pathogenic microorganisms and prolongs the onset of take-all disease through modulation of cell reprogramming and signaling events.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31313992> by Pseudomonas aeruginosa of dental unit waterlines and its relationship with other bacteria: suggestions for microbiological monitoring.</a></h2><p>Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an environmental bacterium, ubiquitous in aquatic habitats and water distribution systems, including dental unit waterlines (DUWLs). We investigated the prevalence of P. aeruginosa in DUWLs from private dental settings. We also analyzed the relationship between P. aeruginosa contamination and the presence of Legionella spp. and total viable count (TVC) in order to suggest a simple and inexpensive protocol to test the quality of water from DUWLs. We detected and quantified P. aeruginosa both by culture and by a PMA (propidium monoazide)-qPCR method. Overall, we detected P. aeruginosa in 17 samples using the PMA-qPCR and in 11 samples using the culture. All culture-positive samples were positive with the PMA-qPCR too, with an agreement between the two methods of 93% and a Cohen's kappa coefficient of κ = 0.747 (good concordance). Comparing results with results of our previous study, we noted that (a) P. aeruginosa was isolated only from DUWLs with high TVC and () five out of six Legionella-positive samples were negative for Pseudomonas spp. Our final suggestion is that the cleanliness of DUWLs should be assessed by TVC because it is a good indicator of the presence of pathogens such as Legionella spp. and P. aeruginosa.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31427449>Intradermal or Sublingual Delivery and Heat-Labile Enterotoxin Proteins Shape Immunologic Responses to a CFA/I Fimbria-Derived Subunit Antigen Vaccine against Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli.</a></h2><p>Enterotoxigenic  (ETEC) is a major cause of infectious diarrhea in children, travelers, and deployed military personnel. As such, development of a vaccine would be advantageous for public health. One strategy is to use subunits of  factors combined with antigen/adjuvant toxoids as an ETEC vaccine. Here, we investigated the intradermal (i.d.) or sublingual (s.l.) delivery of CFA/I fimbrial antigens, including CfaEB and a CfaE-heat-labile toxin  subunit (LTB) chimera admixed with double mutant heat-labile toxin (LT) LT-R192G/L211A (dmLT). In addition, we compared dmLT with other LT proteins to better understand the generation of adjuvanted fimbrial and toxoid immunity as well as the influence on any local skin reactogenicity. We demonstrate that immunization with dmLT admixed with CfaEB induces robust serum and fecal antibody responses to CFA/I fimbriae and LT but that i.d. formulations are not optimal for s.l. delivery. Improved s.l. vaccination outcomes were observed when higher doses of dmLT (1 to 5 μg) were admixed with CfaEB or, even better, when a CfaE-LTB chimera antigen was used instead. Serum anti-CFA/I total antibodies, detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, were the best predictor of functional antibodies, based on the inhibition of red blood cell agglutination by ETEC. Immunization with other LT proteins or formulations with altered -subunit binding during i.d. immunization (e.g., by addition of 5% lactose, LTA1, or LT-G33D) minimally altered the development of antibody responses and cytokine recall responses but reduced skin reactogenicity at the injection site. These results reveal how formulations and delivery parameters shape the adaptive immune responses to a toxoid and fimbria-derived subunit vaccine against ETEC.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31430055>A new approach to the production of a biovital skin graft based on human acellular dermal matrix produced in-house, in vitro revitalized internally by human fibroblasts and keratinocytes on the surface.</a></h2><p>Patients with extensive and deep burns who do not have enough donor sites for autologous skin grafts require alternative treatment methods. Tissue engineering is a useful tool to solve this problem. The aim of this study was to find the optimal method for the production of a biovital skin substitute based on acellular dermal matrix (ADM) and in vitro cultured fibroblasts and keratinocytes. In this work, nine methods of ADM production were assessed. The proposed methods are based on the use of the following enzymes: Dispase II, collagenase I/ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), collagenase II/EDTA, and mechanical perforation using DermaRoller and mesh dermatome. The obtained ADMs were examined (both on the side of the basement membrane and on the "cut-off" side) by means of scanning electron microscopy, immunohistochemistry tests and strength tests. ADM was revitalized with human fibroblasts and keratinocytes. The ability of in-depth revitalization of cultured fibroblasts and their ability to secrete collagen IV was examined. The obtained results indicate that the optimal method of production of live skin substitutes is the  of autologous fibroblasts and keratinocytes on the scaffold obtained using two-step incubation method: Trypsin/EDTA and dispase II.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31268930>Intravascular  of Kaposi Sarcoma: Expanding the Spectrum of Specific Infiltrates of -Cell Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia.</a></h2><p>-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), a low-grade malignancy consisting of CD5(+), CD23(+), and CD43(+) small  lymphocytes, is the most frequent leukemia in the western world. Patients with CLL may exhibit skin changes characterized by histopathologic evidence of infiltration by atypical  lymphocytes, also known as "specific cutaneous infiltrates of CLL"; in addition, CLL is known to be associated with an increased risk of second cancers, including Kaposi sarcoma (KS). The combination of KS and CLL within the same cutaneous biopsy specimen has only rarely been described.

Moreover, recent studies indicate that even bacterial surface  can depend on the mechanics of the substrate. Here, we focus on physical mechanisms that can give rise to substrate-rigidity dependent migration. We study a "twitcher", a cell driven by extension-retraction cycles, to idealize bacteria and perhaps eukaryotic cells that employ a slip-stick mode of motion. The twitcher is asymmetric and always pulls itself forward at its front. Analytical calculations show that the migration speed of a twitcher depends non-linearly on substrate rigidity. For soft substrates, deformations do not lead to build-up of significant force and the migration speed is therefore determined by stochastic adhesion unbinding. For rigid substrates, forced adhesion rupture determines the migration speed. Depending on the force-sensitivity of front and rear adhesions, forced bond rupture implies an increase or a decrease of the migration speed. A requirement for the occurrence of rigidity-dependent stick-slip migration is a "sticky" substrate, with binding rates being an order of magnitude larger than unbinding rates in absence of force. Computer simulations show that small stall forces of the driving machinery lead to a reduced movement on high rigidities, regardless of force-sensitivities of bonds. The simulations also confirm the occurrence of rigidity-dependent migration speed in a generic model for slip-stick migration of cells on a sticky substrate.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31078966>Cellular immune response induced by surface immunogenic protein with AbISCO-100 adjuvant vaccination decreases group  Streptococcus vaginal .</a></h2><p>Group  Streptococcus (GBS) represents one of the most common causes of bacterial infection in neonates; it is also associated with premature childbirth and stillbirth. A vaccine against GBS is needed, but no approved vaccines are yet available. The Surface Immunogenic Protein (SIP) of GBS is conserved in all serotypes and had been reported to be a good vaccine prototype in a mouse model of GBS infection. Also, we have previously shown that both subcutaneous and oral immunization with rSIP can induce an efficient immune response that decreases GBS vaginal  in mice. In this study, we show that a vaccine based on a mixture of rSIP and AbISCO-100 adjuvant reduces GBS vaginal  in mice and induces antibodies with opsonophagocytic activities. Moreover, the passive transfer of sera and total T-cells from mice immunized with rSIP mixed with AbISCO-100 to unvaccinated mice decreases vaginal GBS  in an infected mouse.

During pregnancy, GBS asymptomatically colonizes the vaginal tract of 20-30% of healthy women, but can be transmitted to the neonate  or during birth resulting in neonatal pneumonia, sepsis, meningitis, and subsequently 10-15% mortality regardless of antibiotic treatment. While various GBS virulence factors have been implicated in vaginal  and invasive disease, the regulation of many of these factors remains unclear. Recently, CRISPR-associated protein-9 (Cas9), an endonuclease known for its role in CRISPR/Cas immunity, has also been observed to modulate virulence in a number of bacterial pathogens. However, the role of Cas9 in GBS  and disease pathogenesis has not been well-studied. We performed allelic replacement of  in GBS human clinical isolates of the hypervirulent sequence-type 17 strain lineage to generate isogenic Δ mutants. Compared to parental strains, Δ mutants were attenuated in murine models of hematogenous meningitis and vaginal  and exhibited significantly decreased invasion of human brain endothelium and adherence to vaginal epithelium. To determine if Cas9 alters transcription in GBS, we performed RNA-Seq analysis and found that 353 genes (>17% of the GBS genome) were differentially expressed between the parental WT and Δ mutant strain. Significantly dysregulated genes included those encoding predicted virulence factors, metabolic factors, two-component systems (TCS), and factors important for cell wall formation. These findings were confirmed by qRT-PCR and suggest that Cas9 may regulate a significant portion of the GBS genome. We studied one of the TCS regulators, CiaR, that was significantly downregulated in the Δ mutant strain. RNA-Seq analysis of the WT and Δ strains demonstrated that almost all CiaR-regulated genes were also significantly regulated by Cas9, suggesting that Cas9 may modulate GBS gene expression through other regulators. Further we show that CiaR contributes to GBS vaginal  and persistence. Altogether, these data highlight the potential complexity and importance of the non-canonical function of Cas9 in GBS  and disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31472099>Shifts in the skin microbiome associated with diaper dermatitis and emollient treatment amongst infants and toddlers in China.</a></h2><p>The microbiological basis of diaper dermatitis has not been clearly elucidated; however, a better understanding of microbial  may be vital for developing appropriate therapies.Using 16S-rRNA gene sequencing technology, we characterized and compared the bacterial communities obtained from the buttock skin sites of children with diaper dermatitis and from healthy controls. Bacterial diversity in the buttock lesion area and subsequent recovery after emollient treatment have been discussed herein.In buttock skin of children with or without diaper dermatitis, Staphylococcus and Anaerococcus were predominant in the total skin microbiome. Compared with the healthy group, the overall skin bacterial richness and diversity were higher in children with diaper dermatitis, with the abundance of Proteobacteria being significantly higher. In the diaper dermatitis group, the richness of Enterococcus, Erwinia and Pseudomonas was significantly higher, and the levels of Clostridium and Actinomyces were significantly lower than those in healthy children. Richness of Staphylococcus aureus was significantly higher in the diaper dermatitis group, whereas that of Staphylococcus epidermidis and Bifidobacterium longum was lower. Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus haemolyticus, the dominant species found in buttock skin, were observed to recover earlier after the disease had improved through emollient treatment.Staphylococcus epidermidis, as skin probiotic bacterium, and  longum, Clostridium butyricum and Lactobacillus ruminis, which are intestinal probiotic bacteria, are significantly decreased in diaper dermatitis lesions. These changes in the buttock skin microflora indicate an imbalance in the microflora and suggest that the intestinal microflora may be undergoing dynamic changes. The results of this study suggest that probiotic bacterial supplementation may be useful in the treatment and prevention of diaper dermatitis.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Patients aged 18 years or older who had been using an endotracheal tube for 48 hours were recruited. Tracheal secretions were collected; after extubation, the ETs were cut into two fragments in the infra-cuff region. One of these fragments was placed in a solution containing antibiotics and sent to the lab for culture and identification of yeasts. The remaining fragment was fixed and subjected to scanning electron microscopy (SEM). In total, 20 patients with an average age of 73.3 years (± 13.1) participated in this study. These patients remained under endotracheal intubation and invasive mechanical ventilation for an average of 6.4 (± 1.8) and 13.5 days (± 15), respectively. Of these patients, 45 % showed respiratory tract  by yeasts of the  genus, with  being the most frequently isolated species (66.7 %). Moreover, in almost 90 % of these patients, blastoconidia of the same yeast were found in the infra-cuff portion of the ET, as evidenced by SEM, strongly fixed on the ET surface. Yeasts isolated from both the infra-cuff region and the tracheobronchial secretions were susceptible to amphotericin  and fluconazole. In conclusion, our results show that the frequency of  by yeasts of the  genus in the tracheobronchial secretions of intubated patients within 48 hours is high, and that these species can also be found as a biofilm on the ET surface.Copyright © 2019 Ferreira et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31600299>Synbiotic supplementation to decrease Salmonella  in the intestine and carcass contamination in broiler birds.</a></h2><p>In vitro and in vivo experiments were conducted to study the effects of synbiotic supplementation on Salmonella enterica ser.

Lactobacillus reuteri, Enterococcus faecium, Bifidobacterium animalis, and Pediococcus acidilactici culture supernatants decreased (P < 0.05) the in vitro proliferation of SE at 1:1 supernatant: pathogen dilution. A total of 240 Cobb-500 broiler chicks were randomly allotted to three treatment groups (8 replicates/group with 10 birds/replicate): control (basal diet), antibiotic (Virginiamycin at 20 mg/kg feed), synbiotic (PoultryStar® ME at 0.5 g/kg feed containing L. reuteri, E. faecium, . animalis, P. acidilactici and a Fructooligosaccharide) from day of hatch. At 21 d of age, all birds in experimental groups were orally inoculated with 250 μl of 1 X 109 CFU SE. Antibiotic supplementation increased (P < 0.05) body weight and feed consumption, compared to the control group. Birds in the synbiotic supplementation had intermediate body weight and feed consumption that were not significantly different from both the control and antibiotic group at 42 d of age in SE infected birds. No significant effects were observed in feed efficiency at 42 d of age among the groups. Antibiotic and synbiotic supplementation decreased (P < 0.05) SE load in cecal contents by 0.90 and 0.85 log units/ g and carcass SE load by 1.4 and 1.5 log units/mL of rinsate compared to the control group at 42 d of age (21 dpi). The relative abundance of IL-10, IL-1, TLR-4, and IFNγ mRNA was decreased (P < 0.05) in the antibiotic and synbiotic supplementation groups compared to the control birds at 42 d of age (21 dpi).

We aimed to identify the quinolone that by disk diffusion best discriminates phenotypic wild-type isolates (ciprofloxacin MIC ≤ 0.06 mg/L) of E. coli from isolates with acquired resistance, and to determine the resistance genotype of each isolate. The susceptibility of 108 E. coli isolates was evaluated by ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, nalidixic acid, and pefloxacin disk diffusion and correlated to ciprofloxacin MIC (broth microdilution) using EUCAST methodology. Genotypic resistance was identified by PCR and DNA sequencing. The specificity was 100% for all quinolone disks. Sensitivity varied substantially, as follows: ciprofloxacin 59%, levofloxacin 46%, moxifloxacin 59%, nalidixic acid 97%, and pefloxacin 97%. We suggest that in situations where low-level quinolone resistance might be of importance, such as when screening for quinolone resistance in fecal samples pre-TRUS-, a pefloxacin (S ≥ 24 mm) or nalidixic acid (S ≥ 19 mm) disk, or a combination of the two, should be used. In a setting where plasmid-mediated resistance is prevalent, pefloxacin might perform better than nalidixic acid.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31402812>Promoting water deficit tolerance and anthocyanin fortification in pigmented rice cultivar ( L. subsp. ) using arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi inoculation.</a></h2><p>Drought or water deficit is a major abiotic stress that can reduce growth and productivity in the rice crop especially in the rain-fed areas, which face long-term water shortage.

'Hom Nil' at booting stage using arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF)-inoculation, mixed spores of ,  and  in the soil before rice seedling transplantation. At booting stage, the AMF-inoculated (+AMF) and AMF-uninoculated plants (-AMF) were subjected to control (well-watering; 46.6% SWC) and water deficit condition (14 days water withholding; 13.8% SWC).  percentage in the AMF-inoculated root tissues were evidently proved in both with and without water deficit conditions, leading to elevate total phosphorus in root and leaf tissues. Interestingly, sucrose and total soluble sugar concentration in the flag leaf were increased by 5.0 folds and 1.5 folds, respectively in the plants under water deficit (WD). Free proline was accumulated in flag leaf when exposure to water deficit, subsequently regulated by AMF-inoculation. Total soluble sugar and free proline enrichment in 'Hom Nil' was a major mode of osmotic adjustment to control osmotic potential in the cellular level when exposed to water deficit, leading to maintained photosynthetic abilities and growth performances. Concentration of chlorophyll  in AMF-inoculated plants under water deficit stress was retained, causing to improve chlorophyll fluorescence and net photosynthetic rate. Shoot height and number of tillers were significantly declined by 12.5% and 11.6%, respectively, when subjected to WD. At the harvest, grain yield, panicle dry weight and fertility percentage of AMF-inoculated rice from WD were greater than those without AMF by 1.5, 3.9 and 2.4 folds, respectively. Cyanidin-3-glucoside and peonidin-3-glucoside concentrations in pericarp were enriched in the grain derived from AMF-inoculation with water deficit stress. Overall growth characters and physiological adaptations in 'Hom Nil' grown under water deficit condition were retained by AMF inoculation, resulting in enhanced yield attributes and anthocyanin fortification in rice grain.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31127871>Prevalence of group  streptococcus anogenital  and feasibility of an intrapartum screening and antibiotic prophylaxis protocol in Cameroon, Africa.</a></h2><p>To evaluate group  streptococcus (GBS)  prevalence and feasibility of intrapartum GBS screening/antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP) in Cameroon, Africa.Prospective cohort in the Cameroon Baptist Convention Health Services network.

To establish a durable and safe filling material, we herein combined acellular dermal matrix (ADM) with autologous dermal cells and tested the performance of this matrix in wound healing and shaping.To prepare the ADM, stratified skin was obtained from the back of two New Zealand rabbits and decellularized to obtain ADM. The ADM was ultrasonically mixed with as-prepared autologous dermis in vitro. The mixture was injected as a subcutaneous filler into the back area of 20 New Zealand rabbits.

The development of infection-resistant, osteoblast-compatible biomaterials could represent an effective strategy to prevent bacterial  of implants, reducing the need for antibiotics. In this study, the widely used biomaterial titanium was functionalized with BMAP27(1-18), an α-helical cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide that retains potent staphylocidal activity when immobilized on agarose beads. A derivative bearing a short spacer with a free thiol at the N-terminus was coupled to silanized titanium disks via thiol-maleimide chemistry. Tethering was successful, as assessed by Contact angle, Quartz Crystal Microbalance with Dissipation monitoring (QCM-D), and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS), with an average surface mass density of 456 ng/cm and a layer thickness of 3 nm. The functionalized titanium displayed antimicrobial properties against a reference strain of Staphylococcus epidermidis with well-known biofilm forming capability. Reduction of bacterial counts and morphological alterations of adhering bacteria, upon 2 h incubation, indicate a rapid contact-killing effect. The immobilized peptide was not toxic to osteoblasts, which adhered and spread better on functionalized titanium when co-cultured with bacteria, compared to non-coated surfaces. Results suggest that functionalization of titanium with BMAP27(1-18) could be promising for prevention of bacterial  in bone graft applications.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier .V.

However, it remains unclear how perturbations of the gut microbiota compromise host infection resistance, especially through changes at species and metabolite levels.Here, we illustrate how Bacteroides vulgatus, a dominant species of the Bacteroidetes phylum in mouse intestine, suppresses infection by Vibrio cholerae, an important human pathogen. Clindamycin (CL) is an antibiotic that selectively kills anaerobic bacteria, and accordingly Bacteroidetes are completely eradicated from CL-treated mouse intestines. The Bacteroidetes-depleted adult mice developed severe cholera-like symptoms, when infected with V. cholerae. Germ-free mice mono-associated with . vulgatus became resistant to V. cholerae infection. Levels of V. cholerae growth-inhibitory metabolites including short-chain fatty acids plummeted upon CL treatment, while levels of compounds that enhance V. cholerae proliferation were elevated. Furthermore, the intestinal  process of V. cholerae was well-simulated in CL-treated adult mice.Overall, we provide insights into how a symbiotic microbe and a pathogenic intruder interact inside host intestine. We identified . vulgatus as an indigenous microbial species that can suppress intestinal infection. Our results also demonstrate that commensal-derived metabolites are a critical determinant for host resistance against V. cholerae infection, and that CL pretreatment of adult mice generates a simple yet useful model of cholera infection.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31088328>Frequent  of betahaemolytic streptococci at various body sites including the perineum and anal canal during erysipelas and cellulitis.</a></h2><p> Erysipelas and cellulitis are usually caused by betahaemolytic streptococci but the aetiology is often difficult to verify in clinical practice.

This task requires tracking changes in biodiversity at large spatial scales and correlating with species functional traits. We provide three comprehensive resources to understand the determinants for mitochondrial DNA differentiation represented by (a) 15,609 COI sequences and () 14 traits belonging to 307 butterfly species occurring in Western-Central Europe and (c) the first multi-locus phylogenetic tree of all European butterfly species. By applying phylogenetic regressions we show that mitochondrial DNA spatial differentiation (as measured with G , G' , D and D ) is negatively correlated with species traits determining dispersal capability and  ability. Thanks to the high spatial resolution of the COI data, we also provide the first zoogeographic regionalization maps based on intraspecific genetic variation. The overall pattern obtained by averaging the spatial differentiation of all Western-Central European butterflies shows that the paradigm of long-term glacial isolation followed by rapid pulses of post-glacial expansion has been a pervasive phenomenon in European butterflies. The results and the extensive data sets we provide here constitute the basis for genetically-informed conservation plans for a charismatic group in a continent where flying insects are under alarming decline.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31644794>Wolbachia Infection in Two Species: Novel Views on the  Ability of Wolbachia in Aphids.</a></h2><p>Wolbachia pipientis (Rickettsiales: Anaplasmataceae) is an intracellular symbiont residing in arthropods and filarial nematodes. Sixteen supergroups have been described from different host taxa. Four supergroups A, , M, and N were found in aphids according to prior studies. The cotton aphid, Aphis gossypii, and the green peach aphid, Myzus persicae, are typical polyphagous species with global distributions. We conducted an extensive and systematic survey of Wolbachia infections in these aphids from China. High incidences of Wolbachia infection were detected. The total infection incidence was 60% in A. gossypii and 88% in M. persicae. Both aphid species were infected with supergroups A,  and M. Different incidences of infection were observed among the seven geographical regions in China, which suggested a positive relationship between Wolbachia infections and the geographical distribution of aphid species. Furthermore, multiple infection patterns (M, , A&M, &M, and A&&M) were observed. Infection patterns M and &M were detected in almost all populations. Patterns A&&M and  showed geographical restriction in North China. Three factors can possibly influence the Wolbachia infection incidences and patterns: the geographical distribution, aphid species, and different supergroup types.© The Author(s) 2019.

A key factor in determining outcomes is  with multi-drug resistant (MDR) organisms. Infections secondary to MDR organisms are challenging due to lack of adequate antibiotic treatment, subsequently prolonging hospital stay and increasing risk of adverse outcomes. : This review highlights the most frequent organisms colonizing burn wounds as well as the most common MDR bacterial infections. Additionally, we discuss different treatment modalities and MDR infection prevention strategies as their appropriate management would minimize morbidity and mortality in this population. We conducted a search for articles on PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Cochrane, Scopus and UpToDate with applied search strategies including a combination of: "burns, 'thermal injury,' 'infections,' 'sepsis,' 'drug resistance,' and 'antimicrobials.' : Management and prevention of MDR infections in burns is an ongoing challenge. We highlight the importance of preventative over therapeutic strategies, which are easy to implement and cost-effective. Additionally, targeted, limited use of antimicrobials can be beneficial in burn patients. A promising future area of investigation within this field is post-trauma microbiome profiling. Currently, the best treatment strategy for MDR in burn patients is prevention.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31645449>A Recombinant Rhesus Monkey Rhadinovirus Deleted of Glycoprotein L Establishes Persistent Infection of Rhesus Macaques and Elicits Conventional T Cell Responses.</a></h2><p>A replication-competent, recombinant strain of rhesus monkey rhadinovirus (RRV) expressing the Gag protein of SIVmac239 was constructed in the context of a glycoprotein L (gL) deletion mutation. Deletion of gL detargets the virus from Eph family receptors. The ability of this gL-minus Gag recombinant RRV to infect, persist, and elicit immune responses was evaluated after intravenous inoculation of two  RRV-naïve rhesus monkeys. Both monkeys responded with an anti-RRV antibody response, and quantitation of RRV DNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) by real time PCR revealed levels similar to those in monkeys infected with recombinant gL+ RRV. Comparison of RRV DNA levels in sorted CD3+ vs. CD20+ vs. CD14+ PBMC subpopulations indicated infection of the CD20+ subpopulation by the gL-minus RRV. This contrasts with results obtained with transformed  cell lines  where deletion of gL resulted in markedly reduced infectivity. Over a period of 20 weeks Gag-specific CD8+ T cell responses were documented by major histocompatibility complex class-I (MHC-I) tetramer staining. Vaccine-induced CD8+ T cell responses, which were predominantly directed against the Mamu-A*01-restricted Gag(181-189)CM9 epitope, could be inhibited by blockade of MHC-I presentation. Our results indicate that gL and the interaction with Eph family receptors is dispensable for the  of the  cell compartment following high-dose infection by the intravenous route, which suggests the existence of alternative receptors. Further, gL-minus RRV elicits cellular immune responses that are predominantly canonical in nature. Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is associated with a substantial disease burden in sub-Saharan Africa, often in the context of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. The related rhesus monkey rhadinovirus (RRV) has shown potential as a vector to immunize monkeys with antigens from the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), the macaque model for HIV. KSHV and RRV engage cellular receptors from the Eph family via the viral gH/gL glycoprotein complex. We have now generated a recombinant RRV that expresses the SIV Gag antigen and does not express gL. This recombinant RRV was infectious by the intravenous route, established persistent infection in the  cell compartment, and elicited strong immune responses to the SIV Gag antigen. These results argue against a role of gL and Eph family receptors for  cell infection by RRV  and have implications for the development of a live-attenuated KSHV vaccine or vaccine vector.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31309503>An In Vitro Bladder Model for Studying Catheter-Associated Urinary Tract Infection and Associated Analysis of Biofilms.</a></h2><p>Urethral catheters are among the most widely used medical devices, applied to manage a wide range of conditions in hospital, community, and care home settings. In long-term catheterized individuals, infection with Proteus mirabilis frequently complicates the care of patients owing to formation of extensive crystalline biofilms. Here we describe the use of an in vitro bladder model of the catheterized urinary tract and associated analyses to study P. mirabilis crystalline biofilm formation. The model originally described by Stickler et al.

Models may be used to replicate either established infection or early stage , and we describe a range of associated methods for quantification and visualization of biofilms formed on catheters. These methods are also easily adapted to study catheter-associated biofilm formation by other urinary tract pathogens.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31220185>Characterization of Brucella canis infection in mice.</a></h2><p>Canine brucellosis, caused by Brucella canis, is a disease of dogs and represents a public health concern as it can be transmitted to humans. Canine brucellosis is on the rise in the United States and there is currently no vaccine for use in dogs. Mice have been extensively utilized to investigate host-pathogen interactions and vaccine candidates for smooth Brucella species and could serve a similar role for studying . canis. However, comparatively little is known about . canis infection in mice. The objective of this study was to characterize the kinetics of  and pathogenicity of . canis in mice in order to evaluate the mouse as a model for studying this pathogen. C57BL/6 mice were inoculated intraperitoneally with 105, 107, or 109 CFU of Brucella canis RM6/66 and euthanized 1-, 2-, 4-, 6-, 9-, and 12-weeks post-inoculation. . canis induced splenomegaly in mice infected with 109 CFU at 1- and 2 weeks post-inoculation while no gross lesions were observed in other dose groups. Infection at the two higher doses resulted in dose-dependent granulomatous hepatitis and histiocytic infiltration of the spleen and mesenteric lymph nodes by 1-2 weeks. . canis was cultured from the liver, spleen, uterus, bone marrow, lung, and kidney in all groups with  declining at a slow but steady rate throughout the experiment. Clearance was achieved by 9 weeks 105 CFU group and by 12 weeks in the 107 CFU group, while . canis persisted in the spleen until 12 weeks in the highest dose group. Although . canis does not demonstrate significant replication in C57BL/6 mice, it has the ability to establish an infection, induce splenomegaly, and persist for several weeks in multiple organs. Moreover, 1 x 107 CFU appears to be a suitable challenge dose for investigating vaccine safety.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31138564>Lichtheimia corymbifera  Leading to Pulmonary Infection Can Be Prevented with Liposomal Amphotericin  in a New Murine Model.</a></h2><p>The incidence of pulmonary mucormycosis is constantly increasing, especially in hematological patients staying in high-efficiency particulate air-filtered rooms. Pulmonary inhalation of spores may occur outside the hospital, leading to invasive disease once patients received chemotherapies. We developed a new pulmonary mucormycosis mouse model mimicking the expected pathophysiology in human to study antifungal drugs. Naive mice were inoculated intratracheally with  spores. After 3 days, mice received corticosteroids and cyclophosphamide and secondarily developed the disease, while only 5% of the initial inoculum was present in the lungs at day 3. Lung  with  spores in immunocompetent mice can last at least 44 days. Antifungal drug was administered the day of immunosuppression. Injection of a single 15 mg/kg of body weight dose of liposomal amphotericin  significantly improved survival and pulmonary fungal burden compared with controls, whereas 80 mg/kg oral posaconazole did not. These results show that a unique dose of liposomal amphotericin  offers a real potential decolonization treatment to prevent infection in our mouse model of  lung  followed by lung infection.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31028005>Adaptive Evolution within Gut Microbiomes of Healthy People.</a></h2><p>Natural selection shapes bacterial evolution in all environments.

However, no method has been developed to control disease-associated commensal microbes. We investigated whether immunization with microbial antigens, using CpG oligodeoxynucleotides and/or curdlan as adjuvants, induces systemic antigen-specific IgA and IgG production and affects development of diseases in mice.C57BL/6 mice were given intramuscular injections of antigens (ovalbumin, cholera toxin -subunit, or pneumococcal surface protein A) combined with CpG oligodeoxynucleotides and/or curdlan. Blood and fecal samples were collected weekly and antigen-specific IgG and IgA titers were measured. Lymph nodes and spleens were collected and analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for antigen-specific splenic T-helper 1 cells, T-helper 17 cells, and memory  cells. Six weeks after primary immunization, mice were given a oral, nasal, or vaginal boost of ovalbumin; intestinal lamina propria, bronchial lavage, and vaginal swab samples were collected and antibodies and cytokines were measured. Some mice were also given oral cholera toxin or intranasal Streptococcus pneumoniae and the severity of diarrhea or pneumonia was analyzed. Gnotobiotic mice were gavaged with fecal material from obese individuals, which had a high abundance of Clostridium ramosum (a commensal microbe associated with obesity and diabetes), and were placed on a high-fat diet 2 weeks after immunization with C ramosum. Intestinal tissues were collected and analyzed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction.Serum and fecal samples from mice given injections of antigens in combination with CpG oligodeoxynucleotides and curdlan for 3 weeks contained antigen-specific IgA and IgG, and splenocytes produced interferon-gamma and interleukin 17A. Lamina propria, bronchial, and vaginal samples contained antigen-specific IgA after the ovalbumin boost. This immunization regimen prevented development of diarrhea after injection of cholera toxin, and inhibited lung  by S pneumoniae. In gnotobiotic mice colonized with C ramosum and placed on a high-fat diet, the mice that had been immunized with C ramosum became less obese than the nonimmunized mice.Injection of mice with microbial antigens and adjuvant induces antigen-specific mucosal and systemic immune responses. Immunization with S pneumoniae antigen prevented lung infection by this bacteria, and immunization with C ramosum reduced obesity in mice colonized with this microbe and placed on a high-fat diet. This immunization approach might be used to protect against microbe-associated disorders of intestine.Copyright © 2019 AGA Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.

In Canada, universal screening for GBS  is offered to pregnant people at 35-37 weeks' gestation and those who test positive are offered intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP). Universal screening and treatment with IAP have not eradicated all cases of EOGBSD, and IAP has documented side effects. Probiotic supplements have been proposed as a possible way to reduce GBS .  Pregnant midwifery clients >18 years of age and <45 years of age and with a gestational age of <25 weeks at the time of enrolment were randomly assigned to receive two capsules of probiotics ( GR-1 and  RC-14) or placebo orally daily for 12 weeks at 23-25 weeks' gestation. The primary aim was to determine the feasibility of a larger study. The rate of GBS vaginal/rectal  at 35-37 weeks' gestation was also assessed in both groups.  In total, 139 pregnant midwifery clients were randomized (probiotic group [ = 73] and placebo group [ = 66]). Of these, 113 were included in the final analysis (probiotic group [ = 57] and placebo group [ = 56]). Baseline characteristics between groups were similar with the exception of gestational age ( < .01). The recruitment rate was low at 12%, but the mean compliance rate was 87%.

The ClosTron-generated cwp22 mutant showed decreased TcdA and TcdB production during early growth, and increased cell permeability and autolysis. Importantly, the cwp22 mutation impaired cellular adherence in vitro and decreased cytotoxicity and fitness over the parent strain in a mouse infection model. Furthermore, lactate dehydrogenase cytotoxicity assay, live-dead cell staining and transmission electron microscopy confirmed the decreased cell viability of the cwp22 mutant. Thus, Cwp22 is involved in cell wall integrity and cell viability, which could affect most phenotypes of R20291.

We re-analysed the long-term outcomes of restoration on vegetation and plant functional traits in 38 European fens restored by rewetting (18 sites) and topsoil removal (20 sites). We used traits related to nutrient acquisition strategies, competitiveness, seed traits, and used single- and multi-trait metrics. A separate set of vegetation records from near-natural fens with diverse plant communities was used to generate reference values to aid the comparisons. We found that both restoration methods enhanced the similarity of species composition to non-degraded systems but trait analysis revealed differences between the two approaches. Traits linked to nutrient acquisition strategies indicated that topsoil removal was more effective than rewetting. After topsoil removal competitive species in plant communities had decreased, while stress-tolerant species had increased. A substantial reduction in nutrient availability ruled out the effect of initial disturbance. An ability to survive and grow in anoxic conditions was enhanced after restoration, but the reference values were not achieved. Rewetting was more effective than topsoil removal in restricting variation in traits values permitted in re-developing vegetation. We found no indication of a shift towards reference in seed traits, which suggested that dispersal constraint and  deficit can be a widespread phenomena. Two functional diversity indices: functional richness and functional dispersion showed response to restoration and shifted values towards reference mires and away from the degraded systems. We concluded that targeting only one type of environmental stressor does not lead to a recovery of fens, as it provides insufficient level of stress to restore a functional ecosystem. In general, restoration efforts do not ensure the re-establishment and long-term persistence of fens. Restoration efforts result in recovery of fen ecosystems, confirmed with our functional trait analysis, although more rigid actions are needed for restoring fully functional mires, by achieving high and constant levels of anoxia and nutrient stresses.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31537886>Clinical and Microbiological Characteristics of Group  Streptococcus from Pregnant Women and Diseased Infants in Intrapartum Antibiotic Prophylaxis Era in Taiwan.</a></h2><p>Group  Streptococcus (GBS) is one of the most important pathogens for neonates.

A novel GBS Ia ST890 emerged, becoming the fourth most common clone. Overall 96% of the invasive GBS infections were caused by serotypes Ia, Ib, and III. We collected 300 GBS isolates from vagina of the healthy pregnant women in 2014 and 2017. The serotype distribution of the maternal  isolates was VI (35%), III (21%), V (15%), Ib (13%) and Ia (11%) in 2014, and VI (32%), III (22%), V (16%), Ia (16%), and Ib (8%) in 2017. The most common sequence types were ST1 (32%), ST12 (22%), and ST23 (15%). Serotype diversity of maternal  strains did not change between 2014 and 2017. The study provides useful information in surveillance of GBS disease in the era of IAP.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31018106> protein interaction networks: evidence of horizontal gene transfer and evolution of reduced genomes among .</a></h2><p> is a member of the  class responsible for urogenital tract infection in cattle and small ruminants. Studies indicate that the process of horizontal gene transfer, the exchange of genetic material among different species, has a crucial role in mollicute evolution, affecting the group's characteristic genomic reduction process and simplification of metabolic pathways. Using bioinformatics tools and the STRING database of known and predicted protein interactions, we constructed the protein-protein interaction network of  and compared it with the networks of other members of the  class. We also investigated horizontal gene transfer events in subnetworks of interest involved in purine and pyrimidine metabolism and urease function, chosen because of their intrinsic importance for host  and virulence. We identified horizontal gene transfer events among  and from  to  and , bacterial groups that colonize the urogenital niche. The overall tendency of genome reduction and simplification in the  is echoed in their protein interaction networks, which tend to be more generalized and less selective. Our data suggest that the process was permitted (or enabled) by an increase in host dependence and the available gene repertoire in the urogenital tract shared via horizontal gene transfer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31271109>Di--butyl phthalate degrading endophytic bacterium  strain JR20 isolated from garlic chive and its  in a leafy vegetable.</a></h2><p>Di--butyl phthalate (DBP) is one of the primary PAEs (phthalate acid esters) pollutants. DBP can be absorbed by plants and threaten human health via the food chain. Some DBP-degrading bacteria have been successfully isolated from the environment (water, soil, etc.). However, only a few DBP-degrading plant endophytes have been isolated. In this study, an endophytic bacterium,  subsp. strain JR20, which was found capable of degrading DBP, was isolated from garlic chive. We found that strain JR20 metabolized 89.74% of DBP at a 5 mg/L concentration within 4 d in liquid mineral salts medium (MSM). The optimized conditions for maximum removal of DBP were as follows: DBP concentration, 5 mg/L; pH, 7-8; temperature, 30-40 °C. The  of strain JR20 significantly improved the degradation rate of DBP in the roots, stems and leaves of leafy vegetables.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31192160>phiD12-Like Livestock-Associated Prophages Are Associated With Novel Subpopulations of  Infecting Neonates.</a></h2><p>Group   (GBS) is a major cause of invasive disease in neonates worldwide. Monitoring data have revealed a continuing trend toward an increase in neonatal GBS infections, despite the introduction of preventive measures. We investigated this trend, by performing the first ever characterization of the prophage content for 106 GBS strains causing neonatal infections between 2002 and 2018. We determined whether the genome of each strain harbored prophages, and identified the insertion site of each of the prophages identified. We found that 71.7% of the strains carried at least one prophage, and that prophages genetically similar to livestock-associated phiD12, carrying genes potentially involved in GBS pathogenesis (e.g., genes encoding putative virulence factors and factors involved in biofilm formation, bacterial persistence, or adaptation to challenging environments) predominated. The phiD12-like prophages were (1) associated with CC17 and 1 strains ( = 0.002), (2) more frequent among strains recovered during the 2011-2018 period than among those from 2002-2010 ( < 0.001), and (3) located at two major insertion sites close to bacterial genes involved in host adaptation and . Our data provide evidence for a recent increase in lysogeny in GBS, characterized by the acquisition, within the genome, of genetic features typical of animal-associated mobile genetic elements by GBS strains causing neonatal infection. We suggest that lysogeny and phiD12-like prophage genetic elements may have conferred an advantage on GBS strains for adaptation to or  of the maternal vaginal tract, or for pathogenicity, and that these factors are currently playing a key role in the increasing ability of GBS strains to infect neonates.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31465938>Development of nose-to-brain delivery of ketoconazole by nanostructured lipid carriers against cryptococcal meningoencephalitis in mice.</a></h2><p>Cryptococcus neoformans-mediated meningoencephalitis is a critical infectious disorder of the human central nervous system. However, efficient treatment for the disease is limited due to the poor penetration across the blood brain barrier (BBB). Here, we develop a nose-to-brain drug delivery system utilizing nanostructured lipid carriers (NLCs). We demonstrated that fluorescent-dye-loaded NLCs efficiently uptake into the cytoplasm of encapsulated C. neoformans cells. In comparison with current antifungal drugs, the ketoconazole (keto)-NLCs show significantly increased antifungal activity against C. neoformans in vivo under various growth conditions. The NLCs show enhanced tissue  properties. Importantly, using animal imaging analyses, NLCs are able to enter brain tissues via the olfactory bulb region by intranasal administration, bypassing the BBB. In addition, NLCs maintain prolonged residence in tissues. In mouse brain tissue, keto-NLCs showed significantly enhanced antifungal activity when administered intranasally, drastically dampening the C. neoformans burden. Taken together, NLCs not only improve the ketoconazole penetration efficiency against capsulated C. neoformans cells, but also boost the efficacy of antifungal drugs. Most importantly, keto-NLCs significantly contribute to the treatment of cryptococcal meningoencephalitis in mice by bypassing the BBB via the olfactory system.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier .V.

C. auris was first described in 2009 from a single isolate but has since been reported in more than 25 countries worldwide. Resistance to fluconazole and amphotericin  is common, and resistance to the echinocandins is emerging in some countries. Antifungal resistance has been shown to be acquired rather than intrinsic and the primary mechanisms of resistance to the echinocandins and azoles have been determined. There are a number of new antifungal agents in phase 2 and phase 3 clinical trials and many have activity against C. auris. This review will discuss what is currently known about antifungal resistance in C. auris, limitations to antifungal susceptibility testing, the mechanisms of resistance, and the new antifungals that are on the horizon.Published by Elsevier Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31464603>Impact of clonally-related Burkholderia contaminans strains in two patients attending an Italian cystic fibrosis centre: a case report.</a></h2><p>Burkholderia contaminans is one of the 20 closely related bacterial of the Burkholderia cepacia complex, a group of bacteria that are ubiquitous in the environment and capable of infecting people with cystic fibrosis (CF). This species is an emerging pathogen and it has been widely isolated from CF patients in Argentina, Spain, Portugal, Australia, Canada, USA with a low prevalence in Ireland, France, Russia, Switzerland, Czech Republic, and Italy. This is the first report of . contaminans affecting two Italian CF patients attending the same CF Centre. We correlate . contaminans colonisation with lung function decline and co-infection with other clinically relevant CF pathogens.. contaminans was identified by Multi Locus Sequence Typing in routine sputum analysis of two Caucasian CF women homozygous for Phe508del CFTR mutation. Sequence Type 102 was detected in both strains. It is known that . contaminans ST102 was isolated both from CF and non-CF patients, with an intercontinental spread across the world. Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA analysis revealed the genetic relatedness between the two strains. We examined their susceptibility to antimicrobial agents, comparing the latter with that recorded for other . contaminans isolated from different countries. We also described key virulence factors possibly linked with a clinical outcome. Specifically, we attempted to correlate  with the incidence of acute exacerbation of symptoms and lung function decline.This case presentation suggests that acquisition of . contaminans ST102 is not directly associated with a lung function decline. We retain that the presence of other CF pathogens (i.e. MRSA and Trichosporon) along with . contaminans ST102 might have contributed to the worsening of clinical conditions in our CF patients. The circumstances leading to the establishment of . contaminans ST102 infections are still unknown. We highlight the importance to proper detect and typing bacteria implicated in CF infection by using molecular techniques.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31362767>Microbiota and gut ultrastructure of Anisakis pegreffii isolated from stranded cetaceans in the Adriatic Sea.</a></h2><p>Inferring the microbiota diversity of helminths enables depiction of evolutionarily established ecological and pathological traits that characterize a particular parasite-host interaction. In turn, these traits could provide valuable information for the development of parasitosis control and mitigation strategy. The parasite Anisakis pegreffii (Nematoda: Anisakidae) realizes the final stage of its life-cycle within gastric chambers of aquatic mammals, causing mild-to-moderate granulomatous gastritis with eosinophilic infiltrate, to severe ulcerative gastritis with mixed inflammatory infiltrate, often associated with bacterial colonies. However, its interaction with the host microbiota remains unknown, and might reveal important aspects of parasite  and propagation within the final host.MySeq Illumina sequencing was performed for the 16S rRNA gene from microbiota isolated from larvae, and uterus and gut of adult A. pegreffii parasitizing stranded striped dolphins (Stenella coeruleoalba). To assess the potential presence of Brucella ceti within isolated microbiota, Brucella-targeted real-time PCR was undertaken. In addition, TEM of the gastrointestinal tract of the infective third-stage (L3) and transitioning fourth-stage larvae (L4) was performed to characterize the morphological differences and the level of larval feeding activity.In total, 230 distinct operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were identified across all samples (n = 20). The number of shared taxa was lower than the number of taxa found specifically in each parasite stage or organ. The dominant taxon was Mycoplasmataceae (genus Mycoplasma) in the gut and uterus of adult A. pegreffii, whereas Fusobacteriaceae (genus Cetobacterium) was the most abundant in 40% of larvae, alongside Mycoplasmataceae. No . ceti DNA was detected in any of the microbiota isolates. TEM revealed differences in gut ultrastructure between L3 and L4, reflecting a feeble, most likely passive, level of feeding activity in L3.Microbiota from L3 was more related to that of the gut rather than the uterus of adult A. pegreffii. Taxa of the larval microbiota showed qualitative and quantitative perturbations, likely reflecting the propagation through different environments during its life-cycle. This suggests an ontogenetic shift in the alpha and beta diversity of microbial communities from uterus-derived towards cetacean-derived microbiota. Although TEM did not reveal active L3 feeding, microbiota of the latter showed similarity to that of an actively feeding adult nematode.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31376060>Prevalence, virulence attributes, and antibiogram of Bordetella avium isolated from turkeys in Egypt.</a></h2><p>Turkey coryza is a major respiratory disease caused by Bordetella avium (. avium). It occurs in all ages of turkeys and is characterized by high morbidity and low mortality rates. The present study aimed firstly at determination of the prevalence rates of . avium in turkeys reared in Egypt at different ages using various diagnostic methods including clinical examination, histopathology, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), bacterial culture, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Using PCR, virulence-associated genes were detected in the confirmed . avium isolates. Furthermore, the antibiotic resistance profiles of the confirmed . avium isolates were examined. The achieved results indicated isolation and identification of . avium infection at different ages of turkeys reared in Egypt. The overall PCR-confirmed prevalence rate of . avium was 22.95%. The identified . avium strains harbored virulence-associated genes responsible for  in the respiratory tract of turkeys including Bordetella virulence gene (100%), fimbriae (71.14%), and filamentous hemagglutinin (85.68%). The isolated . avium strains showed multidrug resistance profiles. . avium isolates were resistant to penicillin (92.82%), ceftiofur (85.68%), nalidixic acid (78.54%), and lincomycin (71.40%). The identified . avium strains showed clear sensitivities to both gentamicin and neomycin, suggesting these as possible antimicrobial candidates for the control of . avium infection in turkeys.</p></html>
