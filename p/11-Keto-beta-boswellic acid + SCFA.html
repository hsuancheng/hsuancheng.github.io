In the present study the growth inhibitory effect of propionyloxy derivative of 11-keto-β-boswellic acid (PKBA; a semisynthetic analogue of 11-keto-β-boswellic acid) on HL-60 promyelocytic leukemia cells is being reported for the first time. In the preliminary studies, in vitro cytotoxicity of PKBA was investigated against eight human  cell lines viz., IMR-32, SF-295 (both neuroblastoma), PC-3 (prostate), Colo-205 (), MCF-7 (breast), OVCAR-5 (ovary), HL-60, Molt-4 (both leukemia) and their respective IC(50) values were found to be 5.95, 7.11, 15.2, 14.5, 15, 15.9, 8.7 & 9.5μg/ml, respectively. For determining the mechanism of cell death in HL-60 cells, PKBA was subjected to different mechanistic studies. DNA relaxation assay of PKBA revealed inhibition of both topoisomerases I & II. The fragmentation analysis of DNA revealed typical ladders indicating the cytotoxic effect to be mediated by induction of apoptosis. The morphologic studies of PKBA showed the presence of true apoptotic bodies. Apoptosis was confirmed further by flow-cytometric detection of sub-G(1) peaks and enhanced annexin-V-FITC binding of the cells. The activation of apoptotic cascade by PKBA in HL-60 cells was found to be associated with the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, release of cytochrome c, activation of initiator and executioner caspases and cleavage of poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP). In vivo studies of PKBA revealed anti-tumoral activity against both ascitic and solid murine tumor models. These studies thus demonstrate PKBA to induce apoptosis in HL-60 cells due to the inhibition of topoisomerases I and II.Copyright © 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

In 2002 the EMEA designated Boswellia an orphan drug status for the treatment of peritumoral oedema. Pharmacokinetic studies yielded low plasma concentrations of the active ingredients  (KBA) and 3-acetyl- (AKBA). In continuation of the tests investigating the factors limiting bioavailability of boswellic acids, the present study examined the permeability of KBA and AKBA in human Caco-2 cell lines. In addition, the interaction of KBA and AKBA with the organic anion transporter OATP1B3 and the multi drug resistant proteins P-glycoprotein and MRP2 was evaluated using partly fluorescent-based assays. The permeability studies revealed poor permeability of AKBA and moderate absorption of KBA with a P(app) value of 1.69 x 10(-6) cm/s. Most of KBA and AKBA were found to be retained by the Caco-2 monolayer. Neither KBA nor AKBA could be identified as substrates of P-glycoprotein. However, both KBA and AKBA modulated the activity of OATP1B3 and MRP2, indicating that therapeutic relevant interactions with other anionic drugs may be expected. The results of the present study provide the first explanation for the pharmacokinetic properties of KBA and AKBA.</p></html>
