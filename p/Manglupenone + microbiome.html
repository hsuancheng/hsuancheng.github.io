We quantified sputum inflammatory cells and inflammatory markers (IL-27, CCL3, CCL5, CXCL8, LTB, MPO) by ELISA, total bacterial load (16S) and pathogenic bacteria by qRT-PCR.AATD-AT patients were younger but had similar spirometric and DLCO values compared to cigarette smoke-associated COPD, despite a lower burden of smoking history. Compared to cigarette smoke-associated COPD, AATD-noT and AATD-AT patients had lower sputum neutrophil levels (=0.0446, =0.0135), total bacterial load (16S) (=0.0081, =0.0223),  (=0.0115, =0.0127) and  (=0.0013, =0.0001). Sputum IL-27 was significantly elevated in CS and cigarette smoke-associated COPD. AATD-AT, but not AATD-noT patients, had IL-27 sputum levels (pg/ml) significantly lower than COPD (=0.0297) and these positively correlated with FEV% predicted values (=0.578, =0.0307).Compared to cigarette smoke-associated COPD, AATD-AT (COPD) patients have a distinct airway inflammatory and microbiological profile. The decreased sputum bacterial load and IL-27 levels in AATD-AT patients suggests that augmentation therapy play a role in these changes.© 2019 Balbi et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31681174>Effect of Metformin on Short-Term High-Fat Diet-Induced Weight Gain and Anxiety-Like Behavior and the Gut .</a></h2><p>The pathogenic factors of the complex epidemic disorder-obesity, have expanded from genetic background, endocrine factors, abnormal feeding behaviors, and direct neural control of adipose tissue physiology. As a chronic metabolic disease, it is important to find new potential therapeutic targets and locate a sensitive time window for intervention. In this study, we focus on the early stage of a high-fat diet mouse model: a short-term 3-week treatment. Our results showed that this short-term 3-week HFD can already induce significant body weight gain, increased adipocyte size and surprisingly, anxiety-like behavior of the animals. Then we tried the early intervention with metformin, already reported for its effects in long-term HFD induced obesity. For a short-term 3-week co-treatment, metformin alleviated the HFD-induced increase in body weight, the increase in adipocyte size and furthermore, the anxiety-like behavior. Differences were noted among the normal diet (ND), HFD, and HFD with metformin co-treatment groups in gut , including its composition and diversity. The possible involvement of gut  cannot be ruled out. Intense phospho-AMPK staining was found in the metformin treatment group in the habenular nuclei, hippocampus and basal ganglia of the brain compared with the HFD group, implying that the anxiolytic effect of metformin could be due to the direct activation of the AMPK pathway in the anxiety-related brain nuclei.Copyright © 2019 Ji, Wang and Li.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695897> responses during virulence adaptation by a phloem-feeding insect to resistant near-isogenic rice lines.</a></h2><p>The microbiomes of phloem-feeding insects include functional bacteria and yeasts essential for herbivore survival and development. Changes in  composition are implicated in virulence adaptation by herbivores to host plant species or host populations (including crop varieties). We examined patterns in adaptation by the green leafhopper, , to near-isogenic rice lines (NILs) with one or two resistance genes and the recurrent parent T65, without resistance genes. Only the line with two resistance genes was effective in reducing leafhopper fitness. After 20 generations on the resistant line, selected leafhoppers attained similar survival, weight gain, and egg laying to leafhoppers that were continually reared on the susceptible recurrent parent, indicating that they had adapted to the resistant host. By sequencing the 16s rRNA gene, we described the  of leafhoppers from colonies associated with five collection sites, and continually reared or switched between NILs. The microbiomes included 69-119 OTUs of which 44 occurred in ≥90% of samples. Of these, 14 OTUs were assigned to the obligate symbiont  clade. After 20 generations of selection, collection site had a greater effect than host plant on  composition. Six bacteria genera, including , were associated with leafhopper virulence. However, there was significant within-treatment, site-related variability in the prevalence of these taxa such that the mechanisms underlying their association with virulence remain to be determined. Our results imply that these taxa are associated with leafhopper nutrition. Ours is the first study to describe  diversity and composition in rice leafhoppers. We discuss our results in light of the multiple functions of herbivore microbiomes during virulence adaptation in insect herbivores.© 2019 The Authors.

To date, the "multiple-hit" hypothesis is largely recognized as an explanation of NAFLD pathogenesis and progression. Obesity and features of the metabolic syndrome have been closely linked to NAFLD development. Due to the increased prevalence of obesity worldwide, NAFLD has reached epidemic proportions over time. Given its unfavorable cardiometabolic burden (such as cardiovascular and metabolic consequences), it represents a worrying phenomenon needing a more comprehensive and successful management. Laboratory tests and classical imaging techniques play a pivotal role in NAFLD diagnosis, but novel noninvasive alternative methods to diagnose and monitor NAFLD have been investigated. Currently, lifestyle modifications remain the mainstay treatment, although its efficacy is poor because of the lack of compliance. Pediatric research is focusing on multiple alternative treatments targeting the main pathogenic factors such as insulin-resistance, dyslipidemia, gut-liver axis and , oxidative stress, and proinflammatory pathways. Results from these studies are promising but larger validation is needed. Innovative therapeutic approaches might add an important piece in the complex knowledge of pediatric NAFLD. We aimed to summarize recent insights into NAFLD diagnosis and treatment in children, with a focus on possible future perspectives in pediatric research.© 2019 Di Sessa et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31684193>Cooperative and Escaping Mechanisms between Circulating Tumor Cells and Blood Constituents.</a></h2><p>Metastasis is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths and despite measurable progress in the field, underlying mechanisms are still not fully understood. Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) disseminate within the bloodstream, where most of them die due to the attack of the immune system. On the other hand, recent evidence shows active interactions between CTCs and platelets, myeloid cells, macrophages, neutrophils, and other hematopoietic cells that secrete immunosuppressive cytokines, which aid CTCs to evade the immune system and enable metastasis. Platelets, for instance, regulate inflammation, recruit neutrophils, and cause fibrin clots, which may protect CTCs from the attack of Natural Killer cells or macrophages and facilitate extravasation. Recently, a correlation between the commensal  and the inflammatory/immune tone of the organism has been stablished. Thus, the  may affect the development of cancer-promoting conditions. Furthermore, CTCs may suffer phenotypic changes, as those caused by the epithelial-mesenchymal transition, that also contribute to the immune escape and resistance to immunotherapy. In this review, we discuss the findings regarding the collaborative biological events among CTCs, immune cells, and  associated to immune escape and metastatic progression.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31683617>Efficacy of a Yeast Cell Wall Extract to Mitigate the Effect of Naturally Co-Occurring Mycotoxins Contaminating Feed Ingredients Fed to Young Pigs: Impact on Gut Health, , and Growth.</a></h2><p>Mycotoxins are produced by fungi and are potentially toxic to pigs. Yeast cell wall extract (YCWE) is known to adsorb mycotoxins and improve gut health in pigs. One hundred and twenty growing (56 kg; experiment 1) and 48 nursery piglets (6 kg; experiment 2) were assigned to four dietary treatments in a 2 × 2 factorial design for 35 and 48 days, respectively. Factors were mycotoxins (no addition versus experiment 1: 180 μg/kg aflatoxins and 14 mg/kg fumonisins; or experiment 2: 180 μg/kg aflatoxins and 9 mg/kg fumonisins, and 1 mg/kg deoxynivalenol) and YCWE (0% versus 0.2%). Growth performance, blood, gut health and , and apparent ileal digestibility (AID) data were evaluated. In experiment 1, mycotoxins reduced ADG and G:F, and duodenal IgG, whereas in jejunum, YCWE increased IgG and reduced villus width. In experiment 2, mycotoxins reduced BW, ADG, and ADFI. Mycotoxins reduced ADG, which was recovered by YCWE. Mycotoxins reduced the AID of nutrients evaluated and increased protein carbonyl, whereas mycotoxins and YCWE increased the AID of the nutrients and reduced protein carbonyl. Mycotoxins reduced villus height, proportion of Ki-67-positive cells, and increased IgA and the proportion of bacteria with mycotoxin-degrading ability, whereas YCWE tended to increase villus height and reduced IgA and the proportion of pathogenic bacteria in jejunum. The YCWE effects were more evident in promoting gut health and growth in nursery pigs, which showed higher susceptibility to mycotoxin effects.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31683170>Potential role of  in oncogenesis, outcome prediction and therapeutic targeting for head and neck cancer.</a></h2><p>In the last decade, human  research is rapidly growing involving several fields of clinical medicine and population health.

This article reviews such data, indicating two important aspects of alterations in the gut in the modulation of mitochondria: (1) Gut permeability increases toll-like receptor (TLR) activators, viz circulating lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and exosomal high-mobility group box (HMGB)1. LPS and HMGB1 increase inducible nitric oxide synthase and superoxide, leading to peroxynitrite-driven acidic sphingomyelinase and ceramide. Ceramide is a major driver of MS pathophysiology via its impacts on glia mitochondria functioning; (2) Gut dysbiosis lowers production of the short-chain fatty acid, butyrate. Butyrate is a significant positive regulator of mitochondrial function, as well as suppressing the levels and effects of ceramide. Ceramide acts to suppress the circadian optimizers of mitochondria functioning, viz daytime orexin and night-time melatonin. Orexin, melatonin, and butyrate increase mitochondria oxidative phosphorylation partly via the disinhibition of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, leading to an increase in acetyl-coenzyme A (CoA). Acetyl-CoA is a necessary co-substrate for activation of the mitochondria melatonergic pathway, allowing melatonin to optimize mitochondrial function. Data would indicate that gut-driven alterations in ceramide and mitochondrial function, particularly in glia and immune cells, underpin MS pathophysiology. Aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) activators, such as stress-induced kynurenine and air pollutants, may interact with the mitochondrial melatonergic pathway via AhR-induced cytochrome P450 (CYP)1b1, which backward converts melatonin to N-acetylserotonin (NAS). The loss of mitochnodria melatonin coupled with increased NAS has implications for altered mitochondrial function in many cell types that are relevant to MS pathophysiology. NAS is increased in secondary progressive MS, indicating a role for changes in the mitochondria melatonergic pathway in the progression of MS symptomatology. This provides a framework for the integration of diverse bodies of data on MS pathophysiology, with a number of readily applicable treatment interventions, including the utilization of sodium butyrate.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31681363>Temporal Dynamics of the Sap  of Grapevine Under High Pierce's Disease Pressure.</a></h2><p>Grapevine is a pillar of the California state economy and agricultural identity. This study provides a comprehensive culture-independent  analysis from the sap of grapevine overtime and in a context of a vascular disease. The vascular system plays a key role by transporting nutrient, water and signals throughout the plant. The negative pressure in the xylem conduits, and low oxygen and nutrient content of its sap make it a unique and underexplored microbial environment. We hypothesized that grapevine hosts in its sap, microbes that have a beneficial impact on plant health by protecting against pathogen attack and supporting key biological processes. To address this hypothesis, we chose a vineyard under high Pierce's disease (PD). PD is caused by the xylem-dwelling pathogenic bacterium . We selected ten grapevines within this vineyard with a range of disease phenotypes, and monitored them over 2 growing seasons. We sampled each vines at key phenological stages (bloom, veraison, and post-harvest) and used an amplicon metagenomics approach to profile the bacterial (16S -V4) and fungal (ITS) communities of the sap. We identified a core  of the sap composed of seven bacterial ( and ) and five fungal (, and ) taxa that were present throughout the growing season. Overall, the sap microbial makeup collected from canes was more similar to the root microbial profile. Alpha diversity metrics indicated a microbial enrichment at bloom and in vines with moderate PD severity suggesting a host-driven microbial response to environmental cues. Beta diversity metrics demonstrated that disease condition and plant phenology impacted microbial community profiles. Our study identified several potential taxonomic targets with antimicrobial and plant growth promoting capabilities that inhabit the grapevine sap and that should be further tested as potential biological control or biofertilizer agents.Copyright © 2019 Deyett and Rolshausen.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696186>Flaxseed oil supplementation improves intestinal function and immunity, associated with altered intestinal  and fatty acid profile in pigs with intrauterine growth retardation.</a></h2><p>Flaxseed oil (FO), enriched in n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), is an important oil source for intestinal development and health. We aimed to study the different effects of FO versus soybean oil (SO) on growth, intestinal health and immune function of neonates with intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) using a weaned piglet model. Forty pairs of male IUGR and normal birth weight piglets, weaned at 21 ± 1 d, were fed diets containing either 4% FO or SO for 3 weeks consecutively. Growth performance, nutrient digestibility and intestinal function parameters, immunology and  composition were determined. IUGR led to a poor growth rate, nutrient digestibility and abnormal immunology variables, whereas feeding FO diet improved systemic and gut immunity, as indicated by increased plasma concentration of immunoglobulin G and decreased CD3+CD8+ T lymphocytes, and down-regulated intestinal expression of genes (MyD88, NF-κB, TNF-α, IL-10). Although IUGR tended to decrease villous height, feeding FO diet tended to increase the villi-crypt ratio and up-regulated expressions of tight junction genes (Claudin-1 and ZO-1), together with increased mucosa contents of n-3 PUFAs and a lower Σn-6/Σn-3 ratio. Besides, FO diet decreased the abundance of pathogenic bacteria Spirochaetes, and increased phylum Actinobacteria, and genera Blautia and Bifidobacterium in colonic digesta. Our findings indicate that IUGR impairs growth rate, nutrient digestibility, and partly immunology variables, whereas feeding FO-supplemented diet could improve intestinal function and immunity of both IUGR and NBW pigs, associated with the altered gut  and mucosal fatty acid profile.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696621>'Vaginal seeding' after a caesarean section provides benefits to newborn children: FOR: Does exposing caesarean-delivered newborns to the vaginal  affect their chronic disease risk?

These microbial diversities are accompanied by different metabolic paths and adaptability reflected even in extreme environments. In the recent decades, biodiversity of microbes in extreme environments has been in scientific focus because the specifically adapted bacteria can improve bioremediation processes in industrial and agriculture application. Instead of time-consuming process of identification of new bacterial strains from habitats rich in , artificial neural network was proposed as a mapping model for resolving the problem of prediction of microbial behaviour.In this article, the occurrence and diversity of alkaliphilic sporogenic bacteria in alkaline soils were investigated. For this purpose, soil samples were collected from different locations: leached soil from the Danube river, cement factory wastewater accumulation, deposit of limestone near the Bešenovo lake and the Beli Majdan cave in the Fruška gora mountain. According to the obtained results, two empirical models were developed that gave a good fit to experimental data and was able to predict the pH and temperature growth profile of the natural isolates successfully. The artificial neural network models showed a reasonably good predictive capability (overall R for temperature growth profile was 0.727, while the overall R for pH growth profile was 0.906).The developed mathematical models provided adequate precision for practical study in the microbiology laboratory and scale-up processes for wide range of laboratory and industrial applications, where specifically-adapted microbial community is needed.

Preventing infections is becoming increasingly important, as frontline antibiotics become less effective and frequently induce recurrence by disrupting intestinal . The clinically most advanced vaccine approaches prevent symptoms once C. difficile infection is established by inducing immunity to secreted clostridial cytotoxins. However, they do not inhibit bacterial colonization and thereby favor asymptomatic carriage. Synthetic oligosaccharides resembling the C. difficile surface glycans PS-I, PS-II, and PS-III are immunogenic and serve as basis for colonization-preventing vaccines. Here, we demonstrate that glycoconjugate vaccine candidates based on synthetic oligosaccharides protected mice from infections with two different C. difficile strains. Four synthetic antigens, ranging in size from di- to hexasaccharides, were conjugated to CRM197, a carrier protein used in commercial vaccines. The vaccine candidates induced glycan-specific antibodies in mice and substantially limited C. difficile colonization and colitis after experimental infection. The glycoconjugates ameliorated intestinal pathology more substantially than a toxin-targeting vaccine. Colonization of the gut by C. difficile was selectively inhibited while intestinal  remained preserved. Passive transfer experiments with anti-PS-I serum revealed that protection is mediated by specific anti-glycan antibodies, however, cell-mediated immunity likely also contributed to protection in vivo.

Different strategies including phytase supplementation and more recently lactic acid (LA) are used to enhance the P availability from cereals in pig diets; however, their impact on the gut  has been rarely related to fecal shedding of opportunistic pathogens. The present study investigated the effect of phytase supplementation and the treatment of dietary cereals with 2.5% LA on the fecal  composition of metabolic active bacteria and expression of virulence factor genes of enterotoxigenic  and  in growing pigs. Phytase supplementation reduced the fecal abundance of the most abundant  family, whereas the LA-treatment of cereals had a stronger impact on the bacterial community, reducing amylolytic, pullulanolytic and hemicellulolytic ,  and  as well as the fecal bacterial species richness (Chao1) and diversity (Shannon index). Mainly the family  benefited from the decline in the aforementioned families, being enriched by both dietary treatments. Multigroup data integration using sparse partial least squares-discriminant analysis showed that among the most discriminative operational taxonomic units (OTU) especially two unclassified -OTUs, one -like OTU and one OTU within the  group were associated with calcium and P levels but were negatively linked with complex carbohydrates in feces.

This comprehensive approach can identify intervention points to interrupt the transmission of pathogenic NTM species from the environment to the susceptible host and to reduce NTM pulmonary disease incidence.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31686027>Genetic basis for the cooperative bioactivation of plant lignans by Eggerthella lenta and other human gut bacteria.</a></h2><p>Plant-derived lignans, consumed daily by most individuals, are thought to protect against cancer and other diseases; however, their bioactivity requires gut bacterial conversion to enterolignans. Here, we dissect a four-species bacterial consortium sufficient for all five reactions in this pathway. A single enzyme (benzyl ether reductase, encoded by the gene ber) was sufficient for the first two biotransformations, variable between strains of Eggerthella lenta, critical for enterolignan production in gnotobiotic mice and unique to Coriobacteriia. Transcriptional profiling (RNA sequencing) independently identified ber and genomic loci upregulated by each of the remaining substrates. Despite their low abundance in gut microbiomes and restricted phylogenetic range, all of the identified genes were detectable in the distal gut microbiomes of most individuals living in northern California. Together, these results emphasize the importance of considering strain-level variations and bacterial co-occurrence to gain a mechanistic understanding of the bioactivation of plant secondary metabolites by the human gut .</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31686768>Prebiotic UG1601 mitigates constipation-related events in association with gut : A randomized placebo-controlled intervention study.</a></h2><p>Constipation is a common functional gastrointestinal disorder and its etiology is multifactorial. Growing evidence suggests that intestinal dysbiosis is associated with the development of constipation. Prebiotics are subjected to bacterial fermentation in the gut to produce short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), which can help relieve constipation symptoms. The prebiotic UG1601 consists of inulin, lactitol, and aloe vera gel, which are known laxatives, but randomized, controlled clinical trials that examine the effects of this supplement on gut  composition are lacking.To assess the efficacy of the prebiotic UG1601 in suppressing constipation-related adverse events in subjects with mild constipation.Adults with a stool frequency of less than thrice a week were randomized to receive either prebiotics or a placebo supplement for 4 wk. All participants provided their fecal and blood samples at baseline and at the end of intervention. Gastrointestinal symptoms and stool frequency were evaluated. The concentrations of serum endotoxemia markers and fecal SCFAs were determined. The relative abundance of SCFA-producing bacteria and the gut microbial community in the responders and non-responders in the prebiotics supplementation group were evaluated.There were no significant differences in gastrointestinal symptoms between groups, although the prebiotic group showed greater symptom improvement. However, after prebiotic usage, serum cluster of differentiation (CD) 14 and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) concentrations were significantly decreased (CD14,  = 0.012; LPS,  < 0.001). The change in LPS concentration was significantly larger in the prebiotic group than in the placebo group ( < 0.001). Fecal SCFAs concentrations did not differ between groups, while the relative abundance of , a major butyrate producer, was significantly increased in the prebiotic group ( = 0.045). The abundances of the phylum Firmicutes and the family Lachnospiraceae (phylum Firmicutes, class Clostridia) ( = 0.009) were decreased in the responders within the prebiotic group. In addition, the proportions of the phylum Firmicutes, the class Clostridia, and the order Clostridiales were inversely correlated with several fecal SCFAs ( < 0.05).Alterations in gut  composition, including a decrease in the phylum Firmicutes and an increase in butyrate-producing bacteria, following prebiotic UG1601 supplementation might help alleviate symptom scores and endotoxemia.©The Author(s) 2019.

The utility of lactulose breath testing (LBT) in predicting response to rifaximin was examined.Adults with IBS-D received open-label rifaximin 550 mg 3 times daily for 2 weeks, followed by a 4-week posttreatment assessment period. Thirteen centers prospectively participated in this substudy. LBT was conducted before (day 1) and after (day 14) therapy (breath samples obtained every 15 minutes; up to 240 minutes). Patient response (decrease from baseline of ≥30% in abdominal pain and ≥50% decrease in frequency of mushy/watery stool), symptom improvement, and the relationship of clinical outcomes to LBT results were assessed.A total of 93 patients were included; 62 (66.7%) had positive baseline LBT results. Overall, 48.4% (45/93) of patients responded to rifaximin; of these, 59.7% (37/62) had a positive baseline LBT vs 25.8% (8/31) with a negative LBT (P = 0.002; odds ratio 4.3, 95% confidence interval, 1.5-12.7). Patients with a positive baseline LBT result experienced significantly greater improvement from baseline in 6 of 7 individual IBS symptoms. LBT results after rifaximin therapy did not correlate with clinical response in the 86 patients with evaluable breath tests (P = 0.21); however, patients whose LBT results normalized after rifaximin had the highest response rate of 76.5% (13/17).A positive baseline LBT result predicted a higher likelihood of response to rifaximin in IBS-D, suggesting a gut  modulatory mechanism of action for rifaximin.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696209>Adaptation of the Gut  to Modern Dietary Sugars and Sweeteners.</a></h2><p>The consumption of sugar has become central to the Western diet. Cost and health concerns associated with sucrose spurred the development and consumption of other sugars and sweeteners, with the average American consuming 10 times more sugar than 100 y ago. In this review, we discuss how gut microbes are affected by changes in the consumption of sugars and other sweeteners through transcriptional, abundance, and genetic adaptations. We propose that these adaptations result in microbes taking on different metabolic, ecological, and genetic profiles along the intestinal tract. We suggest novel approaches to assess the consequences of these changes on host-microbe interactions to determine the safety of novel sugars and sweeteners.Copyright © The Author(s) 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31681013>Intestinal  Confer Protection by Priming the Immune System of Red Palm Weevil  Olivier (Coleoptera: Dryophthoridae).</a></h2><p>The immune system of animals, including insects, is the vital factor to maintain the symbiotic interactions between animals and their associated microbes. However, the effects of gut  on insect immunity remain mostly elusive. Red palm weevil (RPW),  Olivier, is a destructive pest of palm trees worldwide, which has forged alliances with its gut . Here, we found that the aposymbiotic insects succumbed at a significantly faster rate than conventionally reared (CR) ones upon bacterial infection. Physiological assays confirmed that CR insects had stronger antimicrobial activity and higher phenoloxidase activity in contrast to germfree (GF) ones, indicating that the systemic immune responses of GF individuals were compromised markedly. Interestingly, under the bacterial challenge conditions, the reassociation of gut  with GF insects could enhance their survival rate by rescuing their immunocompetence. Furthermore, comparative transcriptome analysis uncovered that 35 immune-related genes, including pathogen recognition receptors, effectors and immune signaling pathway, were significantly downregulated in GF insects as compared to CR ones. Collectively, our findings corrobate that intestinal commensal bacteria have profound immunostimulatory effects on RPW larvae. Therefore, knowledge on the effects of gut  on RPW immune defenses may contribute to of set up efficient control strategies of this pest.Copyright © 2019 Muhammad, Habineza, Ji, Hou and Shi.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696235>MGnify: the  analysis resource in 2020.</a></h2><p>MGnify (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics) provides a free to use platform for the assembly, analysis and archiving of  data derived from sequencing microbial populations that are present in particular environments.

Urbanization was found to be associated with reduced microbial outdoor exposure, increased contact with housing materials, antimicrobials and cleaning products, and increased exposure to chemical diversity.

The microbial composition of the human gut  is modulated by diet and other lifestyle habits and it has been reported that microbial diversity is altered in obese people. Obesity is a worldwide health problem that negatively impacts the quality of life. Currently, the widespread treatment for obesity is bariatric surgery. Interestingly, gut  has been shown to be a relevant factor in effective weight loss after bariatric surgery. Since that the human gut  of normal subjects differs between geographic regions, it is possible that rearrangements of the gut  in dysbiosis context are also region-specific. To better understand how gut  contribute to obesity, this study compared the composition of the human gut  of obese and lean people from six different regions and showed that the  compositions in the context of obesity were specific to each studied geographic location. Furthermore, we analyzed the functional patterns using shotgun DNA metagenomic sequencing and compared the results with other obesity-related metagenomic studies, we observed that microbial contribution to functional pathways were country-specific. Nevertheless, our study showed that although microbial composition of obese patients was country-specific, the overall metabolic functions appeared to be the same between countries, indicating that different  components contribute to similar metabolic outcomes to yield functional redundancy. Furthermore, we studied the  functional changes of obese patients after bariatric surgery, by shotgun metagenomics sequencing and observed that changes in functional pathways were specific to the type of obesity treatment. In all, our study provides new insights into the differences and similarities of obese gut  in relation to geographic location and obesity treatments.Copyright © 2019 Medina, Li, Thomson, Artacho, Pérez-Brocal and Moya.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31697315>MDiNE: A model to estimate differential co-occurrence networks in  studies.</a></h2><p>The human  is the collection of microorganisms colonizing the human body, and plays an integral part in human health. A growing trend in  analysis is to construct a network to estimate the co-occurrence patterns among taxa through precision matrices. Existing methods do not facilitate investigation into how these networks change with respect to covariates.We propose a new model called  Differential Network Estimation (MDiNE) to estimate network changes with respect to a binary covariate. The counts of individual taxa in the samples are modelled through a multinomial distribution whose probabilities depend on a latent Gaussian random variable. A sparse precision matrix over all the latent terms determines the co-occurrence network among taxa. The model fit is obtained and evaluated using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo methods. The performance of our model is evaluated through an extensive simulation study, and is shown to outperform existing methods in terms of estimation of network parameters. We also demonstrate an application of the model to estimate changes in the intestinal microbial network topology with respect to Crohn's disease.MDiNE is implemented in a freely available R package: https://github.com/kevinmcgregor/mdine.A file containing supplemental material has been submitted with this manuscript.© The Author(s) 2019.

Its composition and function are shaped by host- and intra- interactions. Bacteriophages (phages) are viruses that target bacteria and have the potential to modulate bacterial communities.To summarise phage biology and the clinical applications of phages in gastroenterology METHODS: PubMed was searched to identify relevant studies.Phages induce bacterial cell lysis, integration of viral DNA into the bacteria and/or coexistence in a stable equilibrium. Bacteria and phages have co-evolved and their dynamic interactions are yet to be fully understood. The increasing need to modulate microbial communities (e.g., gut , multidrug-resistant bacteria) has been a strong stimulus for research in phages as an antibacterial therapy. In gastroenterology, phage therapy has been mainly studied in infectious diseases such as cholera. However, it is currently being explored in several other circumstances such as treating Clostridioides difficile colitis, targeting adherent-invasive Escherichia coli in Crohn's disease or eradicating Fusobacterium nucleatum in colorectal cancer. Overall, phage therapy has a favourable and acceptable safety profile. Presently, trials with phage therapy are ongoing in Crohn's disease.Phage therapy is a promising therapeutic tool against pathogenic bacteria in the fields of infectious diseases and gastroenterology.

Perturbation of the healthy gut  has been suggested to play a role in the development of inflammatory diseases, including multiple sclerosis (MS). Environmental and genetic factors can influence the composition of the ; therefore, identification of microbial communities linked with a disease phenotype has become the first step towards defining the 's role in health and disease. Use of 16S rRNA metagenomic sequencing for profiling bacterial community has helped in advancing  research. Despite its wide use, there is no uniform protocol for 16S rRNA-based taxonomic profiling analysis. Another limitation is the low resolution of taxonomic assignment due to technical difficulties such as smaller sequencing reads, as well as use of only forward (R1) reads in the final analysis due to low quality of reverse (R2) reads. There is need for a simplified method with high resolution to characterize bacterial diversity in a given biospecimen. Advancements in sequencing technology with the ability to sequence longer reads at high resolution have helped to overcome some of these challenges. Present sequencing technology combined with a publicly available metagenomic analysis pipeline such as R-based Divisive Amplicon Denoising Algorithm-2 (DADA2) has helped advance microbial profiling at high resolution, as DADA2 can assign sequence at the genus and species levels. Described here is a guide for performing bacterial profiling using two-step amplification of the V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene, followed by analysis using freely available analysis tools (i.e., DADA2, Phyloseq, and METAGENassist). It is believed that this simple and complete workflow will serve as an excellent tool for researchers interested in performing  profiling studies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31687714>Ingestion of Bifidobacterium longum subspecies infantis strain CCFM687 regulated emotional behavior and the central BDNF pathway in chronic stress-induced depressive mice through reshaping the gut .</a></h2><p>Increasing evidence points to the effect of the gut  on central nervous system functions. Supplementation of certain microbial strains has been demonstrated to alleviate depressive behaviors and neurological abnormalities. This study took the approach to screen for an anti-depressive Bifidobacterium longum strain from fourteen candidates and systematically verified its effect in a chronic stress-induced depression mice model. B. longum subsp. infantis strain CCFM687 could significantly enhance the biosynthesis of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HTP) in vitro in RIN14B cells through up-regulation of the Tph1 gene expression. Administration of CCFM687 in mice significantly improved the scores in behavioral tests and increased the level of 5-HTP and serotonin (5-HT) in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of the brain. The brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the PFC was also increased, possibly through the 5-HT1A-CREB-BDNF pathway. In addition, CCFM687 alleviated the hyperactivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis response and accordingly reversed the peripheral inflammation status. Moreover, the stress-induced structural and functional dysbiosis of the gut  was improved by CCFM687, through increased alpha diversity and abundance of butyrate-producing bacteria, in conjunction with inhibition of pathogenic gene expression. In summary, these results indicate that supplementation of B. longum subsp. infantis strain CCFM687 may prevent the onset of depression from chronic stress, and RIN14B could serve as an efficient cell model for rapid screening of anti-depressive probiotics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31690526>Isolation of Enterobacteriaceae in airway samples is associated with worse outcome in preschool children with cystic fibrosis.</a></h2><p>Increased abundance of Enterobacteriaceae(EB) in the respiratory  of young CF patients was reported to precede Pseudomonas aeruginosa(PA) colonisation.

Its presence within the animal and human intestinal  was correlated with immunomodulatory effects, mediated by both propionibacterial surface components and by secreted metabolites. It is widely implemented, both in the manufacture of fermented dairy products such as Swiss-type cheeses, and in the production of probiotic food complements, under the form of freeze-dried powders. The bottleneck of this drying process consists in the limited survival of bacteria during drying and storage. Protective pre-treatments have been applied to other bacteria and may, in a strain-dependent manner, confer enhanced resistance. However, very little information was yet published on  adaptation to freeze-drying. In this report, an immunomodulatory strain of this probiotic bacterium was cultured under hyperosmotic constraint in order to trigger osmoadaptation. This adaptation was then combined with acid or thermal pre-treatment.

In recent years, gut  has emerged as a new contributor to the metabolic syndrome establishment and associated cardiovascular diseases, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. We hypothesized that a positive modulation of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) pathway, through phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibition could prevent cardiovascular alterations and gut dysbiosis that may be associated to metabolic syndrome. Spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) were randomly divided into 4 groups: control, cafeteria diet (CD) and sildenafil citrate treated groups (5mg/kg per os) were given either a CD or a standard chow diet for 10 weeks. Body weight, arterial blood pressure and glucose tolerance test were monitored. At the 10th week, cardiac inotropy and coronary perfusion pressure were evaluated on isolated heart according to Langendorff method. Cumulative concentration response curves to phenylephrine and acetylcholine were determined on thoracic aorta rings for vascular reactivity evaluation. Faecal samples were collected for the gut  analysis. Compared to the control group, CD-fed rats showed a significant increase in body weight gain, arterial blood pressure and were glucose intolerant. This group showed also a decrease in β-adrenoceptor-induced cardiac inotropy and coronary vasodilation. Gut  analysis revealed a significant reduction in the abundance of Lactobocillus spp in cafeteria diet-fed rats when compared to the control ones. Sildenafil citrate long-term treatment decreased weight gain and arterial blood pressure, improved coronary vasodilation and reduced α1-adrenoceptor-induced vasoconstriction in CD group. However, it did not reverse gut dysbiosis induced by chronic CD feeding.

Doses of CLA at 10 mg/d and higher alleviated colitis symptoms and reduced inflammation induced by DSS, in which 40 mg/d, 20 mg/d and 10 mg/d CLA significantly increased the concentration of MUC2 and goblet cells, but neither 5 mg/d CLA nor 2.5 mg/d CLA had any effects. Meanwhile, 40 mg/d CLA and 20 mg/d CLA treatments significantly up-regulated the concentration of tight junction proteins (ZO-1, occludin and claudin-3) and ameliorated epithelial apoptosis caused by DSS. Moreover, oxidative stress-related enzymes (SOD, GSH-PX, CAT) and inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-10, IL-6) were modulated by 40 mg/d CLA and 20 mg/d CLA.

Our findings showed that the dioxins/furans dissipation resulted from the stimulation of soil microbial enzyme activities (fluorescein diacetate hydrolase and dehydrogenase) and the increase of bacterial abundance, richness, and diversity, as well as fungal diversity. Amplicon sequencing using Illumina MiSeq analysis led to identification of several bacterial (Bacillaceae, Sphingomonadaceae) and fungal () groups known to be involved in dioxins/furans degradation.

However, little is known about microbial metabolic reprogramming or the role it plays in regulating the fitness of commensal and pathogenic bacteria in the gut. Here, we report that intestinal inflammation reprograms the metabolic pathways of Enterobacteriaceae, such as Escherichia coli LF82, in the gut to adapt to the inflammatory environment. We found that E. coli LF82 shifts its metabolism to catabolize L-serine in the inflamed gut in order to maximize its growth potential. However, L-serine catabolism has a minimal effect on its fitness in the healthy gut. In fact, the absence of genes involved in L-serine utilization reduces the competitive fitness of E. coli LF82 and Citrobacter rodentium only during inflammation. The concentration of luminal L-serine is largely dependent on dietary intake. Accordingly, withholding amino acids from the diet markedly reduces their availability in the gut lumen. Hence, inflammation-induced blooms of E. coli LF82 are significantly blunted when amino acids-particularly L-serine-are removed from the diet. Thus, the ability to catabolize L-serine increases bacterial fitness and provides Enterobacteriaceae with a growth advantage against competitors in the inflamed gut.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31680681>High Throughput Co-culture Assays for the Investigation of Microbial Interactions.</a></h2><p>The study of interactions between microorganisms has led to numerous discoveries, from novel antimicrobials to insights in microbial ecology.

This paper presents a protocol for co-culture interaction assays that are inexpensive, scalable to large sample numbers, and easily adaptable to numerous experimental designs. Microorganisms are cultured together, with each well representing one pairwise combination of microorganisms. A test organism is cultured on one side of each well and first incubated in monoculture. Subsequently, target organisms are simultaneously inoculated onto the opposite side of each well using a 3D-printed inoculation stamp. After co-culture, the completed assays are scored for visual phenotypes, such as growth or inhibition. These assays can be used to confirm phenotypes or identify patterns among isolates of interest.

However, phenolics like flavan-3-ols (F3O) are poorly absorbed along the gastrointestinal tract and structurally rearranged by gut , yielding smaller and more polar metabolites like phenyl-γ-valerolactones, phenylvaleric acids and their conjugates. The present work investigated the ability of F3O-derived metabolites to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB), by linking five experimental models with increasing realism. First, an in silico study examined the physical-chemical characteristics of F3O metabolites to predict those most likely to cross the BBB. Some of these metabolites were then tested at physiological concentrations to cross the luminal and abluminal membranes of brain microvascular endothelial cells, cultured in vitro. Finally, three different in vivo studies in rats injected with pure 5-(3',4'-dihydroxyphenyl)-γ-valerolactone, and rats and pigs fed grapes or a F3O-rich cocoa extract, respectively, confirmed the presence of 5-(hydroxyphenyl)-γ-valerolactone-sulfate (3',4' isomer) in the brain. This work highlighted, with different experimental models, the BBB permeability of one of the main F3O-derived metabolites.

The treatment group was lavaged with S. boulardii (5 × 10 CFU/d) for 12 weeks. The mice were sacrificed and the tumor load in the treatment group was compared with that of a control group. The levels of TNF-α and IL-6 in colon tissue were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. The influence of S. boulardii on TNF-α and IL-6 regulation was also investigated using different colon cell lines. Differences in intestinal  in both stool and intestinal mucosa samples were assessed using 16S rDNA sequencing.S. boulardii treatment reduced AOM/DSS-induced UC carcinogenesis in mice, as indicated by the reduced tumor load and reduced TNF-α and IL-6 levels in vivo, as well its effects on TNF-α and IL-6 activities in vitro. Significant changes in both fecal and mucosal  were observed among the control, the AOM/DSS treated, and AOM/DSS plus S. boulardii treated groups. For fecal , the AOM/DSS treated group was lower in Lactobacillus, but higher in Oscillibacter and Lachnoclostridium than the control group. After intervention with S. boulardii, the percentage of Bacillus and Lactococcus increased, but Lachnoclostridium, Oscillibacter, Bacteroides, and Pseudomonas decreased. For the intestinal mucosal , the AOM/DSS treated group was lower in Bifidobacterium and Ruminococcaceae_UCG-014 and higher in Alloprevotella than the control group. After S. boulardii exposure, the percentage contributions of Lachnoclostridium and Lachnospiraceae_NK4A136 increased.S. boulardii effectively reduced UC carcinogenesis in an AOM/DSS induced mice model.

Total viable counts (TVC), ,  spp., , lactic acid bacteria (LAB),  and yeasts/molds were determined along with the pH and sensory analysis. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) was used to monitor the succession of indigenous  isolates and inoculated  strains. The main spoilage microorganism of HPP-treated samples was  detected after 3 days of storage. HPP decreased the inoculated  population. For the low and medium inoculum case it was detected throughout the shelf-life at both temperatures in populations near to the detection limit or after enrichment. In the high inoculum case, the pathogen decreased ≥5-log cycles after HPP, while increased subsequently to 1.6 and 4.5 log CFU/g at 4 °C and 12 °C, respectively, by the end of the shelf-life. PFGE showed that  isolates exhibited a significant diversity among control samples, whereas this was limited for the HPP-treated samples. The survival and distribution of different  strains depended on the initial inoculum and storage temperature. In conclusion, HPP increased the shelf-life (for 5 and 4 days, at 4 °C and 12 °C, respectively) and enhanced the safety of chicken meat.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31690595>Molecular Reconstruction of the Diet in Human Stool Samples.</a></h2><p>Understanding dietary effects on the gut microbial composition is one of the key questions in human  research.

The commensal  is known to contribute to IgA production in the gut; however, the role of dietary antigens in IgA production is poorly understood. To understand the effect of dietary antigens on IgA production, post-weaning mice were maintained on an elemental diet without any large immunogenic molecules. We found that dietary antigens contribute to IgA production in PPs through induction of follicular helper T cells and germinal center B cells. The role of dietary antigens in the PP responses was further confirmed by adding bovine serum albumin (BSA) into the elemental diet. Although dietary antigens are important for PP responses, they have fewer effects than the  on the development and maturation of ILFs. Furthermore, we demonstrated that dietary antigens are essential for a normal antigen-specific IgA response to  serovar Typhimurium infection.

Vancomycin, the antimicrobial agent usually used to treat bacterial nosocomial infections, is associated with gut dysbiosis. As a lung-gut immunologic axis has been described, this study aimed to evaluate both the immunologic and histopathologic effects on the lungs and the large intestine resulting from vancomycin-induced gut dysbiosis in the P. aeruginosa pneumonia murine model. Metagenomic analysis demonstrated that vancomycin-induced gut dysbiosis resulted in higher Proteobacteria and lower Bacteroidetes populations in feces. Given that gut dysbiosis could augment the proinflammatory status of the intestines leading to a variety of acute inflammatory diseases, bone marrow-derived macrophages were stimulated with cecal content from dysbiotic mice showing a higher expression of proinflammatory cytokines and lower expression of IL-10. Dysbiotic mice showed higher levels of viable bacteria in the lungs and spleen when acutely infected with P. aeruginosa, with more lung and cecal damage and increased IL-10 expression in bronchoalveolar lavage. The susceptible and tissue damage phenotype was reversed when dysbiotic mice received fecal  transplantation. In spite of higher recruitment of CD11b+ cells in the lungs, there was no higher CD80+ expression, DC+ cell amounts or proinflammatory cytokine expression. Taken together, our results indicate that the bacterial community found in vancomycin-induced dysbiosis dysregulates the gut inflammatory status, influencing the lung-gut immunologic axis to favor increased opportunistic infections, for example, by P. aeruginosa.©2019 Society for Leukocyte Biology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695016>Dietary Fat Influences the Expression of Genes Related to Sterol Metabolism and the Composition of Cecal  and Its Metabolites in Rats.</a></h2><p>Numerous studies have evaluated the composition of gut  in experimental animals fed high-fat or low-fiber diets. However, few reports have focused on the effects of different fatty acid (FA) compositions on the diversity of gut  and its metabolites. Therefore, the aim of this research was to investigate the effects of different dietary fats on liver mRNA expression levels of genes related to cholesterol and bile acid (BA) metabolism, as well as to investigate cecal  composition and bacterial metabolites composition in rats. Four-week-old male Wistar/ST rats were fed a 15% fat diet for 30 days, including from different sources (soybean oil, lard, menhaden oil, or tuna oil). Then, the rats' cecal  composition was determined by sequencing the 16S ribosomal RNA gene using next-generation sequencing. Lard diet drastically decreased the expression level of liver ATP-binding cassette subfamily G genes (Abcg5 and Abcg8 genes) compared with other diets. Menhaden oil diet increased the fecal BA excretion compared with soybean oil and lard diets. Fecal BA excretion tended to be positively correlated with the relative abundance of Firmicutes, and negatively correlated with the relative abundance of Bacteroidetes. These results have shown that dietary fats with different FA compositions have a different effect on the relative composition of cecal , and in particular, menhaden oil may have very different effects compared to other experimental fats. The effects of fish oils on the cecal  may differ greatly depending on the ratio of EPA to DHA and the composition of FA other than n-3 polyunsaturated FA.

The intestinal innate and adaptive immunity coordinate and interact with the symbionts contributing to the intestinal homeostasis through establishment of a mutually beneficial relationship by tolerating to symbiotic  and retaining the ability to exert proinflammatory response towards invasive pathogens. Imbalance between the intestinal immune system and commensal organisms disrupts the intestinal microbiological homeostasis, leading to  dysbiosis, compromised integrity of the intestinal barrier, and proinflammatory immune responses towards symbionts. This, in turn, exacerbates the degree of the imbalance. Intestinal adaptive immunity plays a critical role in maintaining immune tolerance towards symbionts and the integrity of intestinal barrier, while the innate immune system regulates the adaptive immune responses to intestinal commensal bacteria.

Currently there are no available studies that investigate heat stress-associated changes in the rumen  of lactating dairy cattle. Improved understanding of the link between heat stress and the ruminal  may be beneficial in developing strategies for relieving the influence of heat stress on ruminants by manipulating ruminal microbial composition. In this study, we investigated the ruminal bacterial composition and metabolites in heat stressed and non-heat stressed dairy cows. Eighteen lactating dairy cows were divided into two treatment groups, one with heat stress and one without heat stress. Dry matter intake was measured and rumen fluid from all cows in both groups was collected. The bacterial 16S rRNA genes in the ruminal fluid were sequenced, and the rumen pH and the lactate and acetate of the bacterial metabolites were quantified. Heat stress was associated with significantly decreased dry matter intake and milk production. Rumen pH and rumen acetate concentrations were significantly decreased in the heat stressed group, while ruminal lactate concentration increased. The influence of heat stress on the microbial bacterial community structure was minor. However, heat stress was associated with an increase in lactate producing bacteria (e.g.,  and unclassified ), and with an increase in , , and unclassified , all of which utilize soluble carbohydrates as an energy source. The relative abundance of acetate-producing bacterium  decreased during heat stress.

The reliability and robustness of PIME were compared against existing methods and tested using 16S rRNA independent datasets. PIME filters microbial taxa not shared in a per treatment prevalence interval starting at 5% prevalence with increasing increments of 5% at each filtering step. For each prevalence interval, hundreds of decision trees are calculated to predict the likelihood of detecting differences in treatments.

GVHD is initiated by the interaction between recipient antigen presenting cells (APC) and donor T-cells, culminating in T-cell differentiation along pathogenic type-1 (Th1/Tc1) and type-17 (Th17/Tc17) paradigms, at the expense of tolerogenic regulatory T-cell (Treg/Tr1) patterns. Type-1 and type-17 T-cells secrete cytokines (e.g. GM-CSF and IFNg) critical to the cytokine storm that amplifies donor APC expansion and their alloantigen presentation. It is become increasingly clear that pathogenic donor T-cell differentiation is initiated by both professional recipient APC (e.g. dendritic cells (DC)) and non-professional APC (e.g. epithelial and mesenchymal), particularly within the GI-tract. In the immediate peri-transplant period, these APC are profoundly modified by PAMP/DAMP signals derived from conditioning and intestinal . Subsequently donor DC in the GI-tract are activated by DAMP/PAMP signals in the colon that gain access to the lamina propria once the mucosal barrier mucosa is compromised by GVHD. This results in donor DC expansion and alloantigen presentation in the colon, and their subsequent migration into the mesenteric lymph nodes. Here, new donor T-cells are primed, expanded, differentiated and imprinted with gut-homing integrins permissive of migration into the damaged GI-tract, resulting in the lethal feed-forward cascade of GVHD. These new insights into our understanding of the cellular and molecular factors initiating GVHD, both spatially and temporally, give rise to a number of logical therapeutic targets, focusing on the inhibition of APC function in the GI-tract.Copyright © 2019 American Society of Hematology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31683517>Immunomodulatory Effect of Gut -Derived Bioactive Peptides on Human Immune System from Healthy Controls and Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease.</a></h2><p>Bioactive peptides secreted by probiotic  (peptide B7) and opportunistic pathogen  (peptide B12) modulate the intestinal cytokine milieu in health.

The IBD mucosa produced higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines referred to healthy controls (HCs). Peptides B7 and B12, however, did not ameliorate the mucosal cytokine milieu in IBD. Human circulating APCs (B-cells, monocytes, plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), and conventional dendritic cells (cDCs)) were characterized by flow cytometry in presence/absence of the peptides. Circulating B-cells, monocytes, and cDCs from IBD patients were more activated than those from HCs. Peptide B7, but not B12, decreased CCR2 expression on all APC subsets from HC, but not IBD patients. Moreover, both peptides tend to further increase their pro-inflammatory profile in IBD. In summary, IBD patients display mucosal and circulating APC pro-inflammatory properties. Peptide B7 immunomodulatory capacity elicited over circulating APCs from HC, but not IBD patients, suggests the presence of disrupted modulatory mechanisms for this peptide in IBD.

In order to assess the possible impact of  on adaptation, we performed an evolutionary experiment in which some D. melanogaster lines were reared on a food substrate with high NaCl concentration while the others were reared on the standard (favourable) substrate. We evaluated the reproductive efficiency of experimental lines on the high salt substrate three years after the experiment started. Our tests confirmed that the lines reared on the salty substrate became more tolerant to high NaCl concentration. Moreover, we found that pre-inoculation of the high salt medium with homogenized salt-tolerant flies tended to improve reproductive efficiency of naïve flies on this medium (compared to pre-inoculation with homogenized control flies). The analysis of yeast  in fly homogenates revealed significant differences in number and species richness of yeasts between salt-tolerant and control lines. We also found that some individual yeast lines extracted from the salt-tolerant flies improved reproductive efficiency of naïve flies on salty substrate (compared to baker's yeast and no yeast controls), whereas the effect of the yeast lines extracted from the control flies tended to be smaller. The yeast Starmerella bacillaris extracted from the salt-tolerant flies showed the strongest positive effect. This yeast is abundant in all salt-tolerant lines, and very rare or absent in all control lines.

The association of glycans to the bacterial cell surface is typically mediated by carbohydrate binding modules (CBMs). Here we report the structure of RiCBM86 appended to a GH10 xylanase from Roseburia intestinalis. This CBM represents a new family of xylan binding CBMs present in xylanases from abundant and prevalent healthy human gut Clostridiales. RiCBM86 adopts a canonical β-sandwich fold, but shows structural divergence from known CBMs. The structure of RiCBM86 has been determined with a bound xylohexaose, which revealed an open and shallow binding site. RiCBM86 recognizes only a single xylosyl ring with direct hydrogen bonds. This mode of recognition is unprecedented amongst previously reported xylan-binding type-B CBMs that display more extensive hydrogen-bonding patterns to their ligands or employ Ca to mediate ligand binding. The architecture of RiCBM86 is consistent with an atypically low binding affinity (K ≈0.5 mM for xylohexaose) compared to most xylan binding CBMs. Analyses using NMR spectroscopy corroborated the observations from the complex structure and the preference of RiCBM86 to arabinoxylan over glucuronoxylan, consistent with the largely negatively charged surface flanking the binding site. Mutational analysis and affinity electrophoresis established the importance of key binding residues, which are conserved in the family.

Gut -host communication is based on several gut-derived compounds, such as short-chain fatty acids, bile acids, methylamines, amino acid-derived metabolites, and microbial-associated molecular patterns, which act as communication signals, and multiple host receptors, which sense the signals, thereby stimulating signaling and metabolic pathways in all key tissues of energy metabolism and food intake regulation. Disturbance in the microbial ecosystem balance, or microbial dysbiosis, causes profound derangements in the regulation of appetite and satiety in the hypothalamic centers of the brain and in key metabolic pathways in peripheral tissues owing to intestinal barrier disruption and subsequent induction of hepatic and hypothalamic inflammation.

In acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), the lung  is enriched with gut-derived bacteria; however, the specific  associated with morbidity and mortality in patients with ARDS remains unclear. This study investigated the specific patterns of the lung  that are correlated with mortality in ARDS patients.We analyzed the lung  from the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of patients with ARDS and control subjects. We measured the copy numbers of 16S rRNA and the serum and BALF cytokines (interleukin [IL]-6, IL-8, receptor for advanced glycation end products, and angiopoietin-2).We analyzed 47 mechanically ventilated patients diagnosed with (n = 40) or without (n = 7; control) ARDS. The alpha diversity was significantly decreased in ARDS patients compared with that of the controls (6.24 vs. 8.07, P = 0.03). The 16S rRNA gene copy numbers tended to be increased in the ARDS group compared with the controls (3.83 × 10 vs. 1.01 × 10 copies/mL, P = 0.06). ARDS patients were subdivided into the hospital survivor (n = 24) and non-survivor groups (n = 16). Serum IL-6 levels were significantly higher in the non-survivors than in the survivors (567 vs. 214 pg/mL, P = 0.027). The 16S rRNA copy number was significantly correlated with serum IL-6 levels in non-survivors (r = 0.615, P < 0.05). The copy numbers and relative abundance of betaproteobacteria were significantly lower in the non-survivors than in the survivors (713 vs. 7812, P = 0.012; 1.22% vs. 0.08%, P = 0.02, respectively). Conversely, the copy numbers of Staphylococcus, Streptococcus and Enterobacteriaceae were significantly correlated with serum IL-6 levels in the non-survivors (r = 0.579, P < 0.05; r = 0.604, P < 0.05; r = 0.588, P < 0.05, respectively).The lung bacterial burden tended to be increased, and the alpha diversity was significantly decreased in ARDS patients. The decreased Betaproteobacteria and increased Staphylococcus, Streptococcus and Enterobacteriaceae might represent a unique microbial community structure correlated with increased serum IL-6 and hospital mortality.The institutional review boards of Hiroshima University (Trial registration: E-447-4, registered 16 October 2019) and Kyoto Prefectural University of Medicine (Trial registration: ERB-C-973, registered 19 October 2017) approved an opt-out method of informed consent.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31689559>Abnormal Eating Patterns Cause Circadian Disruption and Promote Alcohol-Associated Colon Carcinogenesis.</a></h2><p>Alcohol intake with circadian rhythm disruption (CRD) increases colon cancer risk. We hypothesized that eating during or around physiologic rest time, a common habit in modern society, causes CRD and investigated the mechanisms by which it promotes alcohol-associated colon carcinogenesis.Effect of feeding time on CRD was assessed using B6 PER2::LUC mice. TS4Cre×APC mice were used to model colon polyposis and to assess the effects of feeding schedules, alcohol consumption, and prebiotic treatment on  composition, short-chain-fatty-acid (SCFA) levels, colon inflammation and cancer risk. The relationship between butyrate signaling and a proinflammatory profile was assessed by inactivating the butyrate receptor GPR109A.Eating at rest (Wrong-time eating: WTE) shifted the phase of the colon rhythm PER2::LUC mice. In TS4Cre×APC mice, a combination of WTE and alcohol exposure (WTE+Alcohol) decreased the levels of SCFA-producing bacteria and of butyrate, reduced colonic densities of Tregs, induced a proinflammatory profile, characterized by hyperpermeability and an elevated mucosal Th17/Treg ratio, and promoted CRC. Prebiotic treatment improved the mucosal inflammatory profile and attenuated inflammation and cancer. WTE+Alcohol-induced polyposis was associated with increased STAT3 expression. Decreased butyrate signaling activated epithelial STAT3 in vitro. The relationship between butyrate signaling and a proinflammatory profile was confirmed in human colorectal cancers using The Cancer Genome Atlas.Abnormal timing of food intake caused CRD and interacts with alcohol consumption to promote colon carcinogenesis by inducing a pro-tumorigenic inflammatory profile driven by changes in the colon  and butyrate signaling.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Participants chewed a sugar-free gum with or without CPP-ACP six times daily for 20 min over two weeks. The study also involved no gum chewing (no gum) for the same two week period. Participants were randomly assigned to one of the test gums or no gum for each intervention period. Participants abstained from oral hygiene and had washout periods of two weeks between intervention periods. After each intervention period, supragingival plaque was collected and analysed for bacterial composition by sequencing the V4 variable region of the 16S rRNA gene. Data were analysed using a linear mixed model.The CPP-ACP gum intervention produced a significant (p < 0.01) increase in the proportions of S. sanguinis (112%), as well as the commensal species Rothia dentocariosa (127%), Corynebacterium durum (80%) and Streptococcus mitis (55%) when compared with the no gum intervention. All the species that were promoted by the CPP-ACP gum are known to possess one or both of the alkali-producing enzymes arginine deiminase and nitrate reductase.This clinical study demonstrated that chewing a sugar-free gum containing CPP-ACP promoted prebiosis by significantly increasing the proportion of S. sanguinis and other health-associated bacterial species in supragingival plaque.Regular chewing of CPP-ACP sugar-free gum increases the proportions of health-associated commensal species in supragingival plaque to promote prebiosis and oral homeostasis.Copyright © 2019.

A growing body of data highlights a role for alterations in the gut in the pathoetiology and/or pathophysiology of ASD. Recent work shows alterations in the gut  to have a significant impact on amygdala development in infancy, suggesting that the alterations in the gut  may act to modulate not only amygdala development but how the amygdala modulates the development of the frontal cortex and other brain regions.This article reviews wide bodies of data pertaining to the developmental roles of the maternal and foetal gut and immune systems in the regulation of offspring brain development.A number of processes seem to be important in mediating how genetic, epigenetic and environmental factors interact in early development to regulate such gut-mediated changes in the amygdala, wider brain functioning and inter-area connectivity, including via regulation of microRNA (miR)-451, 14-3-3 proteins, cytochrome P450 (CYP)1B1 and the melatonergic pathways. As well as a decrease in the activity of monoamine oxidase, heightened levels of in miR-451 and CYP1B1, coupled to decreased 14-3-3 act to inhibit the synthesis of N-acetylserotonin and melatonin, contributing to the hyperserotonemia that is often evident in ASD, with consequences for mitochondria functioning and the content of released exosomes. These same factors are likely to play a role in regulating placental changes that underpin the association of ASD with preeclampsia and other perinatal risk factors, including exposure to heavy metals and air pollutants. Such alterations in placental and gut processes act to change the amygdala-driven biological underpinnings of affect-cognitive and affect-sensory interactions in the brain.Such a perspective readily incorporates previously disparate bodies of data in ASD, including the role of the mu-opioid receptor, dopamine signalling and dopamine receptors, as well as the changes occurring to oxytocin and taurine levels. This has a number of treatment implications, the most readily applicable being the utilization of sodium butyrate and melatonin.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31697363>Gardnerella and vaginal health: the truth is out there.</a></h2><p>The human vagina is a dynamic ecosystem in which homeostasis depends on mutually beneficial interactions between the host and their microorganisms. However, the vaginal ecosystem can be thrown off balance by a wide variety of factors. Bacterial vaginosis (BV) is the most common vaginal infection in women of childbearing age, but its etiology is not yet fully understood, with different controversial theories being raised over the years. What is generally accepted is that BV is often characterized by a shift in the composition of the normal vaginal , from a Lactobacillus species dominated  to a mixture of anaerobic and facultative anaerobic bacteria. During BV, a polymicrobial biofilm develops in the vaginal microenvironment, being mainly composed of Gardnerella species. The interactions between vaginal microorganisms are thought to play a pivotal role in the shift from health to disease and might also increase the risk of sexually transmitted infections acquisition. Here we review the current knowledge regarding the specific interactions that occur in the vaginal niche and discuss mechanisms by which these interactions might be mediated. Furthermore, we discuss the importance of novel strategies to fight chronic vaginal infections.© FEMS 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31696525>The effect of an additive containing three Lactobacillus species on the fermentation pattern and microbiological status of silage.</a></h2><p>Appropriate combinations of LAB strains should be selected to optimize the ensiling process, and the additives should be adjusted to the ensiled forage crops. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of inoculation with three Lactobacillus species on the chemical parameters and microbiological quality (beneficial and harmful ) of grass silage.Three species: L. paracasei-LPa, L. brevis-LB and L. plantarum-LPl, isolated from sugar beet silage and characterized based on 16S rDNA sequences and biochemical parameters, were analyzed in the study. Single strains and their combinations were used as silage inoculants. The basic chemical and microbiological (qPCR) parameters of silages were determined. Based on the results of AHC and PCA, it was determined that silages inoculated with single LAB strains and LPa+LB and commercial additive (0+) were characterized by the best quality, particularly with regard to microbiological parameters and as the only one from the tested variants, it lowered the pH significantly. A consortium of three Lactobacillus species had no influence on silage quality, whereas LPa+LB and LPl+LB combinations as well as a commercial additive exerted positive effects. Inoculation inhibited the growth of toxin-producing fungi.Only the appropriate LAB composition can improve the quality of the ensiled material (antagonistic relationship). Only combination LPa+LB was able to improve the value of low dry silage, nevertheless, almost all combinations were able to reduced concentrations of toxin-producing fungi.

In addition, an association between gut  and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is widely observed in previously published reports. This meta-analysis critically examines the association between gut , and oxidative stress in T2DM.A systematic search for clinical trials was performed in PubMed, Web of Science and Scopus web databases up to 1 Jan 2019. Primary search terms include "", "diabetes", and "oxidative stress". Study was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guideline. All clinical trials that compared the effects of probiotic supplementations with a control group using end points serum levels of fasting blood sugar (FBS), hemoglobin A1C (HbA1C) and oxidative stress biomarkers were included. Two independent researchers screened the data extracted from the relevant studies. The pooled standardized mean difference (SMD) was estimated using the random or fixed effects model. Heterogeneity among the studies was assessed using Q-test.Overall, 13 randomized clinical trials (RCTs) involving 840 subjects with T2DM were included in the meta-analysis. The analysis showed that probiotics intake resulted in significant improvement in serum levels of FBS [SMD: -0.35, 95% CI: (-0.59, -0.12)], total antioxidant status (TAS) [SMD: 0.33, 95% CI: (0.11, 0.55)], total glutathione (GSH) [SMD: 0.41, 95% CI: (0.26, 0.56)] and malondialdehyde (MDA) [SMD: -0.54, 95% CI: (-0.83, -0.26)]. No significant improvement was found in HbA1C [SMD: -0.06, 95% CI:(-0.82, 0.69)], and nitric oxide (NO) [SMD:-0.24, 95% CI:(-1.10, 0.62)] levels.It seems that gut  can exert beneficial effects in diabetic patients via altering oxidative stress' biomarkers. The beneficial effect of gut  however was modest on FBS and non-significant on HbA1C. These results need to be confirmed by conducting more reliable RCTs.CRD42019134905.

Here we test whether diet shapes the composition of bacterial communities associated with CWC. We compared the microbiomes of two common CWC species in aquaria, Lophelia pertusa and Madrepora oculata, when they were either starved, or fed respectively with a carnivorous diet, two different herbivorous diets, or a mix of the 3.

IGFs take part in the embryonal development and postnatal growth, in interaction with the growth hormone (GH). The physiological effects of IGF1 are promotion of tissue growth and development, stimulation of cell proliferation, effects on lipid and carbohydrate metabolism, anti-aging, anti-inflammatory, anabolic, anti-oxidant, neuro- and hepatoprotective properties. Our knowledge about the GH/IGF axis is diverse, partly contradictory, their research is continued intensively nowadays. We considered it worthwhile to review and interpret this information. Study on GH/IGF medical reports, with particular reference to the less known metabolic control. 75% of the growth factors are produced in the liver by GH and insulin stimulation; their effects are expressed on specific receptors, and modified by specific binding proteins. IGF1 directly increases the muscle mass, bone density, and the structure of the bones. Intestinal  induces secretion of IGF1, which promotes the development and remodeling of the bones. Short-chain fatty acids, produced in microbial fermented fibers, induce secretion of IGF1, suggesting that microbial activity also affects bone health  IGF1. IGF1 also has a direct and indirect glucose-lowering effect, enhances free fatty acid oxidation in the muscle, reducing the flow of free fatty acid into the liver, improving insulin signaling, resulting in the reduction of hepatic glucose output, and improves insulin sensitivity. IGF1 directly influences the expression of circadian BMAL1 in hypothalamic cells: this refers to the newly recognized 'zeitgeber' role of IGF1. The bioactivity of insulin-like peptides in the brain is characterized by neuronal survival, excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission, maintenance of normal free fatty acid levels, improvement of cognitive function, protection against cell damage, neurogenesis and angiogenesis. The effects of IGF2 are less outlined, however, it has a relevant role in the development of the fetus, and acts protectively on the brain. Lack or over-expression of IGF1 can be detected or may causally associated in many pathological conditions. According to these collected data, insulin sensitivity may be improved by different pathways. The role of IGFs in these processes should be a task of future research.

The aim of this report was to use metagenomic analyses to investigate the relationship between the oral  and caries in preschool children. A total of 25 preschoolers, aged 3 to 5 years old with severe early childhood caries (ECC), and 19 age-matched, caries-free children as controls were recruited. Saliva samples were collected from the participants and were subjected to metagenomic analyses, whereby the oral microbial communities were investigated. The metagenomic analyses revealed substantial  differences between the two groups, indicating apparent shifts of the oral  present in the ECC group. At the species level, the ECC-enriched microbes included , ,  and  Interestingly,  and  exhibited apparent differences at the strain level but not the species level between the ECC and control groups. Functional examination showed that the ECC group displayed extensive alterations in metabolic genes/pathways/modules, including enriched functions in sugar metabolism. Finally, an SVM (support vector machine) classifier comprising seven species was developed and generated a moderately good performance in predicting caries onset (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC] = 78.33%). Together, these findings indicate that caries is associated with considerable changes in the oral , some of which can potentially be exploited as therapeutic targets or diagnostic markers. (This study has been registered at ClinicalTrials.gov under registration no. .) Dental caries is a highly prevalent oral disease that can lead to severe dental damage and may greatly compromise the quality of life of the affected individuals. Previous studies, including those based on 16S rRNA gene, have revealed that the oral  plays a prominent role in development of the disease. But the approach of those studies was limited in analyzing several key  traits, including species- or strain-level composition and functional profile. Here, we performed metagenomic analyses for a cohort of preschool children with or without caries. Our results showed that caries was associated with extensive  differences at various taxonomic and functional levels. Some caries-associated species had not been previously reported, some of which may have significant clinical implications. A  gene catalogue from children with caries was constructed for the first time. The results demonstrated that caries is associated with alterations of the oral , including changes in microbial composition and metabolic functional profile.Copyright © 2019 Wang et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695359>An Oral Whole-Cell Killed Nontypeable  Immunotherapeutic For The Prevention Of Acute Exacerbations Of Chronic Airway Disease.</a></h2><p>In subjects with chronic bronchitis, protection against acute bronchitis following oral administration of a whole-cell killed nontypeable  (NTHi) preparation was demonstrated in the mid-1980s. Subsequently, studies aiming to validate clinical efficacy of this oral treatment were complicated by a number of factors, including the modification of clinical definitions, the implications of which were not recognized at that time. The objective of this review is to integrate our pre-clinical and clinical research in this field conducted over the past 30 years to demonstrate the evolution of the idea of communication between mucosal surfaces through the common mucosal immune system and the development of an effective oral NTHi immunotherapy. Our earliest studies recruited subjects with chronic sputum production and high levels of culture-positive sputum for Gram-negative bacteria but by 2000, the clinical diagnostic focus had switched from "chronic bronchitis" to "chronic obstructive pulmonary disease" (COPD), which was functionally defined using spirometry. This change led to variable clinical trial results, confirming the importance of chronic sputum production and culture-positive sputum. Additional conditioning factors such as patient age and gender were influential in study populations with low culture-positive sputum production. Through this period, studies in human and in rodent models provided new insights into airway protection mechanisms and the pathogenesis of airway inflammation. Key findings were the importance of a dysbiosis within the airway , and the critical role of an interdependence between the bronchus and the gut, with a Peyer's patch-dependent extra-bronchus "loop" controlling the composition of the bronchus . Within this context, intercurrent virus infections initiate a -dependant hypersensitivity reaction involving Peyer's patch-derived Th17 cells. We conclude that whole-cell killed NTHi immunotherapy has consistent and significant benefits when examined in the context of changing clinical disease definitions, age and gender, and has the potential to change the natural history of chronic airway disease.© 2019 Clancy and Cripps.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31685604>Ketone body receptor GPR43 regulates lipid metabolism under ketogenic conditions.</a></h2><p>Ketone bodies, including β-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate, are important alternative energy sources during energy shortage. β-Hydroxybutyrate also acts as a signaling molecule via specific G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs); however, the specific associated GPCRs and physiological functions of acetoacetate remain unknown. Here we identified acetoacetate as an endogenous agonist for short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) receptor GPR43 by ligand screening in a heterologous expression system. Under ketogenic conditions, such as starvation and low-carbohydrate diets, plasma acetoacetate levels increased markedly, whereas plasma and cecal SCFA levels decreased dramatically, along with an altered gut  composition. In addition, -deficient mice showed reduced weight loss and suppressed plasma lipoprotein lipase activity during fasting and eucaloric ketogenic diet feeding. Moreover, -deficient mice exhibited minimal weight decrease after intermittent fasting. These observations provide insight into the role of ketone bodies in energy metabolism under shifts in nutrition and may contribute to the development of preventive medicine via diet and foods.Copyright © 2019 the Author(s).

Two important hubs have emerged, the placenta/prenatal period and the postnatal gut, with alterations in mitochondria functioning crucial in both.Factors acting to regulate mitochondria functioning in ASD across development are reviewed in this article.Decreased vitamin A, and its retinoic acid metabolites, lead to a decrease in CD38 and associated changes that underpin a wide array of data on the biological underpinnings of ASD, including decreased oxytocin, with relevance both prenatally and in the gut. Decreased sirtuins, poly-ADP ribose polymerase-driven decreases in nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+), hyperserotonemia, decreased monoamine oxidase, alterations in 14-3-3 proteins, microRNA alterations, dysregulated aryl hydrocarbon receptor activity, suboptimal mitochondria functioning, and decreases in the melatonergic pathways are intimately linked to this. Many of the above processes may be modulating, or mediated by, alterations in mitochondria functioning. Other bodies of data associated with ASD may also be incorporated within these basic processes, including how ASD risk factors such as maternal obesity and preeclampsia as well as more general prenatal stressors modulate the likelihood of offspring ASD.Such an integrated model of the pathophysiology of ASD has important preventative and treatment implications.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31683880>Elevation of Trimethylamine-N-Oxide in Chronic Kidney Disease: Contribution of Decreased Glomerular Filtration Rate.</a></h2><p>Gut -dependent Trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) has been reported to be strongly linked to renal function and to increased cardiovascular events in the general population and in Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) patients. Considering the lack of data assessing renal handling of TMAO, we conducted this study to explore renal excretion and mechanisms of accumulation of TMAO during CKD. We prospectively measured glomerular filtration rate (mGFR) with gold standard methods and plasma concentrations of trimethylamine (TMA), TMAO, choline, betaine, and carnitine by LC-MS/MS in 124 controls, CKD, and hemodialysis (HD) patients. Renal clearance of each metabolite was assessed in a sub-group of 32 patients. Plasma TMAO was inversely correlated with mGFR ( = 0.388,  < 0.001), confirming elevation of TMAO plasma levels in CKD. TMAO clearances were not significantly different from mGFR, with a mean ± SD TMAO fractional excretion of 105% ± 32%. This suggests a complete renal excretion of TMAO by glomerular filtration with a negligible participation of tubular secretion or reabsorption, during all stages of CKD. Moreover, TMAO was effectively removed within 4 h of hemodiafiltration, showing a higher fractional reduction value than that of urea (84.9% ± 6.5% vs. 79.2% ± 5.7%,  = 0.04). This study reports a strong correlation between plasma TMAO levels and mGFR, in CKD, that can be mainly related to a decrease in TMAO glomerular filtration.

It provides a direct evidence of functional diversity and structure among  present in niches and significant insights into microbial activity together with metabolomics, which is the study of the intermediate and end-products of cellular processes. Metaproteomics is a comparatively new approach which is facing a number of empirical, technical, computational and experimental design challenges that needs to be addressed. Presently only little efforts have been made to have information on microbial proteins in rhizospheric soil of maize through metagemonics approach but there is no direct evidence on functions of microbial community in this very important niche.

In this study, we investigated the changes of gut  of Xenopus tropicalis at different temperatures under controlled laboratory conditions. The results showed that microbial communities were distinct and shared only a small overlap among froglet guts, culture water and food samples. Furthermore, the dominant taxa harbored in the gut exhibited low relative abundance in water and food. It indicates that bacterial taxa selected by amphibian gut were generally of low abundance in the external environment. Temperature could affect beta-diversity of gut  in terms of phylogenetic distance, but it did not affect alpha diversity. The composition of gut  was similar in warm and cool treatments.

Cells of strain KGMB03357 are Gram-stain-positive, non-motile, non-spore-forming, and observed as straight or curved rods. The isolate grew at 10-45°C (optimum temperature of 40°C) and a pH range of 5.1-10.5 (optimum pH of 6.8). Analysis of phylogenetic trees based on the 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that strain KGMB03357 forms a lineage within the genus Anaerotignum, and is most closely related to Anaerotignum lactatifermentans G17 (= KCTC 15066, 96.1%), Anaerotignum propionicum DSM 1682T (= KCTC 5582, 94.9%), Anaerotignum neopropionicum DSM 03847 (= KCTC 15564T, 94.9%), and Anaerotignum aminivorans SH021 (= KCTC 15705T, 94.8%). The ANI values between strain KGMB 03357T and members of the genus Anaerotignum were 73.3-71.0%, which are below the ANI criterion for interspecies identity.

The present study aims to assess the impact of a high fat diet on tuberculosis progression and  composition in an experimental animal model using a C3HeB/FeJ mouse strain submitted to single or multiple consecutive aerosol infections. These models allowed us to study the protection induced by Bacillus Calmette-Guérin vaccination as well as by the natural immunity induced by chemotherapy after a low dose  infection. Our results show that a high fat diet is able to trigger a pro-inflammatory response, which results in a faster progression toward active tuberculosis and an impaired protective effect of BCG vaccination, which is not the case for natural immunity. This may be related to dysbiosis and a reduction in the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio in the gut  caused by a decrease in the abundance of the Porphyromonadaceae family and, in particular, the  genus. It should also be noted that a high fat diet is also related to an increase in the genera , and , which have previously been related to dysbiotic processes. As diabetes mellitus type 2 is a risk factor for developing tuberculosis, these findings may prove useful in the search for new prophylactic strategies for this population subset.Copyright © 2019 Arias, Goig, Cardona, Torres-Puente, Díaz, Rosales, Garcia, Tapia, Comas, Vilaplana and Cardona.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31687180>Microbiological evaluation of LOCATOR® Legacy attachments: A cross-sectional clinical study.</a></h2><p>This retrospective cross-sectional study aimed to evaluate quantitatively the oral  in the tri-lobe central cavity of Locator Legacy attachment and verify whether it harbors a different, potentially more pathogenic, bacterial spectrum than the adjacent edentulous ridge.Edentulous patients rehabilitated with implant overdentures using Locator Legacy attachments were recruited for this study.

It is associated with the use of antimicrobials that generally disrupt the  of the gastrointestinal tract. Previously, it was thought that C. difficile was primarily a hospital-acquired infection, however, with the emergence of community-associated cases, and whole-genome sequencing suggesting the majority of the hospital C. difficile infection (CDI) cases are genetically distinct from one another, there is compelling evidence that sources/reservoirs of C. difficile outside hospitals play a significant role in the transmission of CDI.To review the 'One Health' aspects of CDI, focusing on how community sources/reservoirs might be acting as a conduit in the transfer of C. difficile between animals and humans. The importance of a One Health approach in managing CDI is discussed.A literature search was performed on PubMed and Web of Science for relevant papers published from 01 January 2000 to 10 July 2019.We present evidence that demonstrates transmission of C. difficile in hospitals from asymptomatic carriers to symptomatic CDI patients. The source of colonization is most probably community reservoirs, such as foods and the environment, where toxigenic C. difficile strains have frequently been isolated. With high-resolution genomic sequencing, the transmission of C. difficile between animals and humans is likely despite a clear epidemiological link often being absent. The ways in which C. difficile from animals and humans can disseminate through foods and the environment are discussed; and an interconnected transmission pathway for C. difficile involving food animals, humans and the environment is presented.C. difficile is a well-established pathogen of both humans and animals that contaminates foods and the environment. To manage CDI, a One Health approach with the collaboration of clinicians, veterinarians, environmentalist and policymakers is paramount.Copyright © 2019 European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases.

A relatively under-explored aspect of this is the role of gammaDelta (γδ) T cells, including prenatally and in the postnatal gut, which seem important hubs in driving the course of ASD.The present article looks at the role of γδ T cells in ASD, including via their interactions with other immune cells shown to be altered in this spectrum of conditions, including natural killer cells and mast cells.Other risk factors in ASD, such as decreased vitamins A & D, as well as toxin-associated activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor may also be intimately linked to γδ T cells, and alterations in the regulation of these cells. A growing body of data has highlighted an important role for alterations in mitochondria functioning in the regulation of immune cells, including natural killer cells and mast cells. This is an area that requires investigation in γδ T cells and their putative subtypes.It is also proposed that maternal stress may be acting via alterations in the maternal , leading to changes in how the balance of short chain fatty acids, such as butyrate, may act to regulate the placenta and developing foetus.

This study evaluated the impact of a yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and microalgae (Aurantiochytrium limacinum) supplementation on caecal, colonic and faecal microbial ecosystem and on blood inflammatory parameters of horses fed high-fibre or high-starch diets. Six fistulated geldings in a 2×2 Latin-square design were alternatively supplemented and received during each period 100% hay (4 weeks) followed by a 56/44 hay/barley diet (3 weeks). Caecal, colonic and faecal samples were collected 4h after the morning meal three times per diet, at 5-day intervals, to measure bacterial richness, diversity, and composition and microbial end-products. Blood was simultaneously collected for measuring inflammatory markers. The starchy diet clearly modified the microbial ecosystem in the three digestive segments, with an increase of the amylolytic function and a decrease of the fibrolytic one. However no effect of the diet was observed on the blood parameters. When horses were supplemented, no significant change was found in lipopolysaccharides, Prostaglandin-E2, Serum Amyloid A concentrations and complete blood count neither in cellulose-utilising, starch-utilising and lactate-utilising bacteria concentrations nor in the volatile fatty acids and lactate concentrations and pH. Under supplementation, relative abundance of Family XIII Clostridiales increased in caecum and faeces irrespective of diet, and relative abundance of Veillonellaceae was higher during hay/barley diet in colon and faeces. Most variations of faecal bacterial taxa under supplementation were not observed in the hindgut. However, all variations suggested that supplementation could increase the fibrolytic function whatever the diet, and limit dysbiosis when horses' diet changed from high-fibre to high-starch.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31680836>Alterations of the Gut  in Multiple System Atrophy Patients.</a></h2><p>Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease, and the pathogenesis is still quite challenging.

Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and the prevalence of AMR genes are increasing, and prediction of antimicrobial susceptibility based on sequence information could support targeted antimicrobial therapy in a clinical setting. Complete identification of insertion sequence (IS) elements carrying promoter sequences upstream of resistance genes is necessary for prediction of AMR. However,  assemblies from short reads alone are often fractured due to repeat regions and the presence of multiple copies of identical IS elements. Identification of plasmids in clinical isolates can aid in the surveillance of the dissemination of AMR, and comprehensive sequence databases support  and metagenomic studies. We tested several short-read, hybrid and long-lead assembly pipelines by assembling the type strain  CCUG4856 (=ATCC25285=NCTC9343) with Illumina short reads and long reads generated by Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) MinION sequencing. Hybrid assembly with Unicycler, using quality filtered Illumina reads and Filtlong filtered and Canu-corrected ONT reads, produced the assembly of highest quality. This approach was then applied to six clinical multidrug-resistant  isolates and, with minimal manual finishing of chromosomal assemblies of three isolates, complete, circular assemblies of all isolates were produced. Eleven circular, putative plasmids were identified in the six assemblies, of which only three corresponded to a known cultured  plasmid. Complete IS elements could be identified upstream of AMR genes; however, there was not complete correlation between the absence of IS elements and antimicrobial susceptibility.

However, the specific responses of intestinal metabolome under simulated weightlessness and its relationship with the intestinal  and immune characteristics remain largely unknown. In the current study, 20 adult Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were randomly divided into the control group and the simulated weightlessness group using a hindlimb unloading model. The metabolomic profiling of cecal contents from eight rats of each group was investigated by gas chromatography-time of flight/mass spectrometry. The significantly different metabolites, biomarkers, and related pathways were identified. Multivariate analysis, such as principal component analysis and orthogonal projections to latent structures-discriminant analysis, demonstrated an obvious separation between the control group and the simulated weightlessness group. Significantly different metabolites, such as xylose, sinapinic acid, indolelactate, and digalacturonic acid, were identified, which participate in mainly pyrimidine metabolism, pentose and glucuronate interconversions, and valine, leucine and isoleucine metabolism. Cytidine-5'-monophosphate, 4-hydroxypyridine, and phloretic acid were determined as pivotal biomarkers under simulated weightlessness. Moreover, the significantly different metabolites were remarkably correlated with dysbiosis of the intestinal  and disturbance of immunological characteristics induced by simulated weightlessness.

The nature of the vaginal  is well-known; in contrast, the upper reproductive tract remains largely unexplored. Alteration in the uterine , which is dependent on the nutrients and hormones available to the uterus, is likely to play an important role in uterine-related diseases such as hysteromyoma, adenomyosis, and endometriosis. Uterine mucosa is an important tissue barrier whose main function is to offer protection against pathogens and other toxic factors, while maintaining a symbiotic relationship with commensal microbes. These characteristics are shared by all the mucosal tissues; however, the uterine mucosa is unique since it changes cyclically during the menstrual cycle as well as pregnancy. The immune system, besides its role in the defense process, plays crucial roles in reproduction as it ensures local immune tolerance to fetal/paternal antigens, trophoblast invasion, and vascular remodeling. The human endometrium contains a conspicuous number of immune cells, mainly Natural Killers (NK) cells, which are phenotypically distinct from peripheral cytotoxic NK, cells and macrophages. The endometrium also contains few lymphoid aggregates comprising B cell and CD8 T cells. The number and the phenotype of these cells change during the menstrual cycle.

Moreover, the treatments also facilitate the polarization of M1 to M2 macrophage phenotypes, meanwhile, suppress the pro-inflammatory cytokines. Fecal microbial DNAs were analyzed and evaluated for GM composition by ERIC-PCR and 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. The GM diversity was increased with the treated groups compared to the control. Further analysis showed that some known short chain fatty acids (SCFAs)-producing bacteria, , , , , and  were significantly enriched in the treated groups. In addition, the key SCFAs receptors, GPR 41, 43 and 109a, were significantly stimulated in the gut epithelial layer of the treated mice. By contract, the relative abundance of pathogens  spp., , and  spp. were distinctly reduced by the treatments with PEO and β-PAE.

It is a complex disorder with numerous contributing (epi)genetic and environmental factors. Currently, treatment consists of behavioural and pharmacological therapy. However, ADHD medication is associated with several side effects, and concerns about long-term effects and efficacy exist. Therefore, there is considerable interest in the development of alternative treatment options. Double-blind research investigating the effects of a few-foods diet (FFD) has demonstrated a significant decrease in ADHD symptoms following an FFD. However, an FFD requires a considerable effort of both child and parents, limiting its applicability as a general ADHD treatment. To make FFD intervention less challenging or potentially obsolete, we need to understand how, and in which children, an FFD affects ADHD behaviour and, consequently, the child's well-being. We hypothesise that an FFD affects brain function, and that the nutritional impact on ADHD is effectuated by a complex interplay between the , gut and brain, that is, the -gut-brain axis.The Biomarker Research in ADHD: the Impact of Nutrition (BRAIN) study is an open-label trial with researchers blinded to changes in ADHD symptoms during sample processing and initial data analyses.The Medical Research and Ethics Committee of Wageningen University has approved this study (NL63851.081.17, application 17/24).

Therefore, we examined the allergic rhinitis (AR)-inhibitory effects of water-extracted RG (wRG), 50% ethanol-extracted RG (eRG), and bifidobacteria-fermented eRG (fRG) in vivo.RBL-2H3 cells were stimulated with phorbol 12-myristate-13-acetate/A23187. Mice with AR were prepared by treatment with ovalbumin. Allergic markers IgE, tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin (IL)-4, and IL-5 were assayed in the blood, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, nasal mucosa, and colon using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Mast cells, eosinophils, and Th2 cell populations were assayed using a flow cytometer.RG products potently inhibited IL-4 expression in phorbol 12-myristate-13-acetate/A23187-stimulated RBL-2H3 cells. Of tested RG products, fRG most potently inhibited IL-4 expression. RG products also alleviated ovalbumin-induced AR in mice. Of these, fRG most potently reduced nasal allergy symptoms and blood IgE levels. fRG treatment also reduced IL-4 and IL-5 levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, nasal mucosa, and reduced mast cells, eosinophils, and Th2 cell populations. Furthermore, treatment with fRG reduced IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 levels in the colon and restored ovalbumin-suppressed Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria populations and ovalbumin-induced Firmicutes population in gut .

The objective of FMT is to re-establish a healthy and diverse gut microbial environment, and FMT has been used in patients with recurrent Clostridium difficile infection, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), or irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). From 2009 to 2015, over 20,623 adult patients were reported to have Clostridium difficile infection (CDI), according to the Canadian Nosocomial Infection Surveillance Program. Approximately 233,000 Canadians are living with IBD, and an estimated 18% of Canadians are living with IBS. FMT is used with the aim of fostering a healthy microbial environment in the gastrointestinal tract in these populations. FMT may be administered via different preparations. Lyophilized FMT is prepared by freezing a filtered stool sample solution from a healthy donor, then freeze drying the sample through sublimation to a powder form. It can be administered orally and through colonoscopy. In contrast, frozen FMT treatment involves freezing filtered stool samples at −80°C, thawing prior to administration, then administrating orally, by enema or via colonscopy. It is suggested that lyophilized FMT is easier to store (e.g., at standard refrigerator temperature of 4°C) and that the powder material is easier to encapsulate. The objective of this report is to evaluate the clinical effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and evidence-based guidelines regarding the use of lyophilized FMT versus frozen FMT for patients of all ages with recurrent CDI, IBD, and IBS.Copyright © 2019 Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31683646>The Signature  Drive Rumen Function Shifts in Goat Kids Introduced to Solid Diet Regimes.</a></h2><p>The feeding regime of early, supplementary solid diet improved rumen development and production in goat kids.

Studies identifying endotypes underlying exacerbation susceptibility and discovering specific biomarkers may lead to the development of targeted therapeutics but are lacking. This study aims to assess a broad spectrum of biomarkers at multiple biological levels (genetics, airway inflammation and respiratory ) for their ability in predicting acute exacerbations of COPD, thus enables high-resolution disease endotyping and may lead to precision treatment of the disease.In this prospective cohort study, participants with stable COPD (n=600) will be recruited and assessed for demographics, symptom scores, spirometry, medication use and comorbidities at baseline.

Participants will be followed up for their exacerbations till 12 months and reassessed for the clinical measurements as baseline. The primary outcomes are total number of exacerbations, severe exacerbations, moderate exacerbations and time to first exacerbation. The secondary outcomes are changes in lung function and symptom scores. The effect of biomarkers representing genetic variants, airway inflammation and respiratory  on predicting the frequent exacerbator phenotype and exacerbation frequency will be analysed with multivariable modelling, and time to first exacerbation with a Cox regression model.The study has been approved by the Clinical Trial and Biomedical Ethics Committee of West China Hospital of Sichuan University (No. 2018-298).

Establishing gut  patterns in a marmoset colony may aid in clinical decision-making and model reproducibility. A standardized method of sample collection and storage is essential for proper interpretation of  data. While  studies commonly utilize fecal samples, the goal of this study was to determine whether the  profile from a rectal swab performed on a sedated animal was comparable to the  profile from a fecal sample. During routine physical exams, paired fecal and rectal swab samples were collected from each of 23 marmosets. DNA was extracted from all fecal and rectal swab samples and 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequences were amplified and analyzed. Initial comparison of the relative abundance of bacterial phyla between paired samples had a r2 value of 0.70 with S of 0.08 with no significant differences in α and β diversity metrics between fecal and rectal samples. Initial analysis however, revealed 5 discordant fecal-rectal pairs which corresponded only with the 5 rectal swabs that were classified as free of visible fecal matter during collection. Exclusion of these 5 pairs resulted in an optimized fit of the data as evidenced by a r2 value of 0.91 with S of 0.05. These results demonstrate that rectal swabs are a reliable method for profiling the fecal  in the marmoset since the bacterial composition from a rectal swab with visible fecal contents correlated well with the bacterial composition from a fecal sample from the same marmoset.

However, it remains challenging to quantitatively evaluate the contribution of this process to the microbial diversity and function in the receiving ecosystems. Currently used methods, i.e., counting shared microbial species, microbial source tracking, and neutral community model, rely on abundance profile to reveal the extent of overlapping between the upstream and downstream communities. Thus, they cannot suggest the quantitative contribution of immigrants to the downstream community function because activities of individual immigrants are not considered after entering the receiving environment. This limitation can be overcome by using an approach that couples a mass balance model with high-throughput DNA sequencing, i.e., ecogenomics-based mass balance. It calculates the net growth rate of individual microbial immigrants and partitions the entire community into active populations that contribute to the community function and inactive ones that carry minimal function. Linking activities of immigrants to their abundance further provides quantification of the contribution from an upstream environment to the downstream community. Considering only active populations can improve the accuracy of identifying key environmental parameters dictating process performance using methods such as machine learning.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694714>Antibiotic therapy and outcome from immune-checkpoint inhibitors.</a></h2><p>Sensitivity to immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICPI) therapy is governed by a complex interplay of tumor and host-related determinants. Epidemiological studies have highlighted that exposure to antibiotic therapy influences the probability of response to ICPI and predict for shorter patient survival across malignancies. Whilst a number of studies have reproducibly documented the detrimental effect of broad-spectrum antibiotics, the immune-biologic mechanisms underlying the association with outcome are poorly understood. Perturbation of the gut , an increasingly well-characterized factor capable of influencing ICPI-mediated immune reconstitution, has been indicated as a putative mechanism to explain the adverse effects attributed to antibiotic exposure in the context of ICPI therapy.

Yet most studies of nonhuman microbiomes have relied on relatively coarse dietary categorizations and have focused either on individual wild populations or on captive animals that are sheltered from environmental pressures, which may obscure the effects of dietary and environmental variation on  composition in diverse natural communities. We analyzed plant and bacterial DNA in fecal samples from an assemblage of 33 sympatric large-herbivore species (27 native, 6 domesticated) in a semiarid East African savanna, which enabled high-resolution assessment of seasonal variation in both diet and  composition. Phylogenetic relatedness strongly predicted  composition ( = 0.91) and was weakly but significantly correlated with diet composition ( = 0.20). Dietary diversity did not significantly predict  diversity across species or within any species except kudu; however, diet composition was significantly correlated with  composition both across and within most species. We found a spectrum of seasonal sensitivity at the diet- nexus: Seasonal changes in diet composition explained 25% of seasonal variation in  composition across species. Species' positions on (and deviations from) this spectrum were not obviously driven by phylogeny, body size, digestive strategy, or diet composition; however, domesticated species tended to exhibit greater diet- turnover than wildlife. Our results reveal marked differences in the influence of environment on the degree of diet- covariation in free-ranging African megafauna, and this variation is not well explained by canonical predictors of nutritional ecology.Copyright © 2019 the Author(s).

To determine the impact of the gut  (GM) on intestinal androgen metabolism, we measured unconjugated (free) and glucuronidated androgen levels in intestinal contents from the small intestine, with a low bacterial density, and from cecum and colon, with a high bacterial density. Using a specific, sensitive gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method, we detected high levels of glucuronidated testosterone (T) and dihydrotestosterone (DHT) in small intestinal content of mice of both sexes, while in the distal intestine, we observed remarkably high levels of free DHT, exceeding serum levels by more than 20-fold. Similarly, in young adult men, high levels of unconjugated DHT, more than 70-fold higher than in serum, were detected in feces. In contrast to mice with a normal GM composition, germ-free mice had high levels of glucuronidated T and DHT, but very low free DHT levels, in the distal intestine. These findings demonstrate that the GM is involved in intestinal metabolism and deglucuronidation of DHT and T, resulting in extremely high free levels of the most potent androgen, DHT, in the colonic content of young and healthy mice and men.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31682994>Both gut  and cytokines act to atherosclerosis in ApoE-/- mice.</a></h2><p>Several studies have suggested a role for the gut  and cytokines in atherosclerosis development, but combined analyses of the changes of the gut  and cytokines have not been explored previously.We treated ApoE-/- and wild-type mice with a high-fat diet for 12 weeks.

The endocannabinoidome (eCBome) - a complex signaling system including the endocannabinoid system, approximately 50 receptors and metabolic enzymes, and more than 20 lipid mediators with important physiopathologic functions modulates gastrointestinal tract function and may mediate host cell-microbe communications there. Germ-free (GF) mice, which lack an intestinal  and so differ drastically from conventionally reared (CR) mice, offer a unique opportunity to explore the eCBome in a microbe-free model and in the presence of a reintroduced functional gut  through fecal  transfer (FMT). We aimed to gain direct evidence for a link between the  and eCBome systems by investigating eCBome alterations in the gut in GF mice before and after FMT. Basal eCBome gene expression and lipid profiles were measured in various segments of the intestine of GF and CR mice at juvenile and adult ages using targeted qPCR transcriptomics and LC-MS/MS lipidomics. GF mice exhibited age-dependent modifications in intestinal eCBome gene expression and lipid mediator levels. FMT from CR donor mice to age-matched GF male mice reversed several of these alterations, particularly in the ileum and jejunum, after only 1 week, demonstrating that the gut  directly impacts the host eCBome and providing a cause-effect relationship between the presence or absence of intestinal microbes and eCBome signaling. These results open the way to new studies investigating the mechanisms through which intestinal microorganisms exploit eCBome signaling to exert some of their physiopathologic functions.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695033>Evaluation of 16S rRNA gene sequencing for species and strain-level  analysis.</a></h2><p>The 16S rRNA gene has been a mainstay of sequence-based bacterial analysis for decades. However, high-throughput sequencing of the full gene has only recently become a realistic prospect. Here, we use in silico and sequence-based experiments to critically re-evaluate the potential of the 16S gene to provide taxonomic resolution at species and strain level. We demonstrate that targeting of 16S variable regions with short-read sequencing platforms cannot achieve the taxonomic resolution afforded by sequencing the entire (~1500 bp) gene. We further demonstrate that full-length sequencing platforms are sufficiently accurate to resolve subtle nucleotide substitutions (but not insertions/deletions) that exist between intragenomic copies of the 16S gene. In consequence, we argue that modern analysis approaches must necessarily account for intragenomic variation between 16S gene copies.

Previous studies have found a positive correlation between thymic atrophy and colitis severity. It was, therefore, worthwhile to investigate the effect of thymopentin (TP5), a synthetic pentapeptide corresponding to the active domain of the thymopoietin, on colitis.  Dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis mice were treated with TP5 by subcutaneous injection. Body weight, colon length, colon weight, immune organ index, disease activity index (DAI) score, and the peripheral blood profile were examined. The immune cells of the spleen and colon were analyzed by flow cytometry. Histology was performed on isolated colon tissues for cytokine analysis. Bacterial DNA was extracted from mouse colonic feces to assess the intestinal . Intestinal lamina propria mononuclear cells (LPMCs), HCT116, CT26, and splenocytes were cultured and treated with TP5.  TP5 treatment increased the body weight and colon length, decreased the DAI score, and restored colon architecture of colitic mice. TP5 also decreased the infiltration of immune cells and expression levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6. Importantly, the damaged thymus and compromised lymphocytes in peripheral blood were significantly restored by TP5. Also, the production of IL-22, both in innate and adaptive lymphoid cells, was triggered by TP5. Given the critical role of IL-22 in mucosal host defense, we tested the effect of TP5 on mucus barrier and gut  and found that the number of goblet cells and the level of Mucin-2 expression were restored, and the composition of the gut  was normalized after TP5 treatment. The critical role of IL-22 in the protective effect of TP5 on colitis was further confirmed by administering the anti-IL-22 antibody (αIL-22), which completely abolished the effect of TP5. Furthermore, TP5 significantly increased the expression level of retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor γ (RORγt), a transcription factor for IL-22. Consistent with this, RORγt inhibitor abrogated the upregulation of IL-22 induced by TP5.  TP5 exerts a protective effect on DSS-induced colitis by triggering the production of IL-22 in both innate and adaptive lymphocytes. This study delineates TP5 as an immunomodulator that may be a potential drug for the treatment of UC.© The author(s).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31684843>Effect of nutrition on neurodegenerative diseases.

The intestinal  has been proposed as an essential factor in mediating the development of AUD complications such as alcoholic liver disease.: To provide a comprehensive description of alcohol-induced intestinal  alterations.: We conducted a systematic review of studies investigating the effect of alcohol on the intestinal  using the PRISMA checklist. We searched the Medline database on the PubMed platform for studies determining the effect of alcohol on  in individuals with AUD. The manual search included references of retrieved articles. Only human studies examining the intestinal bacterial  using 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing were included. Data comparing relative abundances of bacteria comprising intestinal  was extracted.: We retrieved 17 studies investigating intestinal  alterations in individuals with AUD. Intestinal  alterations in individuals with AUD included depletion of  and  and an increase of Enterobacteriaceae. At the phylum level, a higher abundance of Proteobacteria and lower of Bacteroidetes were found. Mixed results regarding  were obtained. Several species of short-chain fatty acids producing bacteria had a lower abundance in individuals with alcohol use disorder.: Intestinal  alterations associated with dysbiosis in individuals with AUD are generally consistent across studies, making it a promising target in potential AUD complications treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31680990>Dysbiosis-Associated Enteric Glial Cell Immune-Activation and Redox Imbalance Modulate Tight Junction Protein Expression in Gulf War Illness Pathology.</a></h2><p>About 14% of veterans who suffer from Gulf war illness (GWI) complain of some form of gastrointestinal disorder but with no significant markers of clinical pathology. Our previous studies have shown that exposure to GW chemicals resulted in altered  which was associated with damage associated molecular pattern (DAMP) release followed by neuro and gastrointestinal inflammation with loss of gut barrier integrity. Enteric glial cells (EGC) are emerging as important regulators of the gastrointestinal tract and have been observed to change to a reactive phenotype in several functional gastrointestinal disorders such as IBS and IBD. This study is aimed at investigating the role of dysbiosis associated EGC immune-activation and redox instability in contributing to observed gastrointestinal barrier integrity loss in GWI via altered tight junction protein expression. Using a mouse model of GWI and  studies with cultured EGC and use of antibiotics to ensure gut decontamination we show that exposure to GW chemicals caused dysbiosis associated change in EGCs. EGCs changed to a reactive phenotype characterized by activation of TLR4-S100β/RAGE-iNOS pathway causing release of nitric oxide and activation of NOX2 since gut sterility with antibiotics prevented this change. The resulting peroxynitrite generation led to increased oxidative stress that triggered inflammation as shown by increased NLRP-3 inflammasome activation and increased cell death. Activated EGCs  and  were associated with decrease in tight junction protein occludin and selective water channel aquaporin-3 with a concomitant increase in Claudin-2. The tight junction protein levels were restored following a parallel treatment of GWI mice with a TLR4 inhibitor SsnB and butyric acid that are known to decrease the immunoactivation of EGCs. Our study demonstrates that immune-redox mechanisms in EGC are important players in the pathology in GWI and may be possible therapeutic targets for improving outcomes in GWI symptom persistence.Copyright © 2019 Kimono, Sarkar, Albadrani, Seth, Bose, Mondal, Li, Kar, Nagarkatti, Nagarkatti, Sullivan, Janulewicz, Lasley, Horner, Klimas and Chatterjee.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31684011>Gastrointestinal  and Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus: The State of Art.</a></h2><p>The incidence of autoimmune type 1 diabetes (T1DM) is increasing worldwide and disease onset tends to occur at a younger age. Unfortunately, clinical trials aiming to detect predictive factors of disease, in individuals with a high risk of T1DM, reported negative results. Hence, actually there are no tools or strategies to prevent T1DM onset. The importance of the gut  in autoimmune diseases is increasingly recognized and recent data suggest that intestinal dysbiosis has a pathogenic role in T1DM by affecting both intestinal immunostasis and the permeability of the gut barrier. An improved understanding of the mechanisms whereby dysbiosis in the gut favors T1DM development may help develop new intervention strategies to reduce both the incidence and burden of T1DM. This review summarizes available data on the associations between gut  and T1DM in both experimental animals and humans and discusses future perspectives in this novel and exciting area of research.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31689910>The Role of Probiotics in Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease: A New Insight into Therapeutic Strategies.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) encompasses a broad spectrum of pathological hepatic conditions ranging from simple steatosis to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), which may predispose to liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Due to the epidemic obesity, NAFLD is representing a global health issue and the leading cause of liver damage worldwide. The pathogenesis of NAFLD is closely related to insulin resistance (IR), adiposity and physical inactivity as well as genetic and epigenetic factors corroborate to the development and progression of hepatic steatosis and liver injury. Emerging evidence has outlined the implication of gut  and gut-derived endotoxins as actively contributors to NAFLD pathophysiology probably due to the tight anatomo-functional crosstalk between the gut and the liver. Obesity, nutrition and environmental factors might alter intestinal permeability producing a favorable micro-environment for bacterial overgrowth, mucosal inflammation and translocation of both invasive pathogens and harmful byproducts, which, in turn, influence hepatic fat composition and exacerbated pro-inflammatory and fibrotic processes. To date, no therapeutic interventions are available for NAFLD prevention and management, except for modifications in lifestyle, diet and physical exercise even though they show discouraging results due to the poor compliance of patients. The premise of this review is to discuss the role of gut-liver axis in NAFLD and emphasize the beneficial effects of probiotics on gut  composition as a novel attractive therapeutic strategy to introduce in clinical practice.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31689904>SensorTalk: An IoT Device Failure Detection and Calibration Mechanism for Smart Farming.</a></h2><p>In an Internet of Things (IoT) system, it is essential that the data measured from the sensors are accurate so that the produced results are meaningful. For example, in AgriTalk, a smart farm platform for soil cultivation with a large number of sensors, the produced sensor data are used in several Artificial Intelligence (AI) models to provide precise farming for soil  and fertility, disease regulation, irrigation regulation, and pest regulation. It is important that the sensor data are correctly used in AI modeling. Unfortunately, no sensor is perfect. Even for the sensors manufactured from the same factory, they may yield different readings. This paper proposes a solution called SensorTalk to automatically detect potential sensor failures and calibrate the aging sensors semi-automatically. Numerical examples are given to show the calibration tables for temperature and humidity sensors. When the sensors control the actuators, the SensorTalk solution can also detect whether a failure occurs within a detection delay. Both analytic and simulation models are proposed to appropriately select the detection delay so that, when a potential failure occurs, it is detected reasonably early without incurring too many false alarms. Specifically, our selection can limit the false detection probability to be less than 0.7%.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31682851>Causes of Socioeconomic Disparities in Colorectal Cancer and Intervention Framework and Strategies.</a></h2><p>Colorectal cancer (CRC) disproportionately affects people from low socioeconomic backgrounds and some racial minorities. Disparities in CRC incidence and outcomes might result from differences in exposure to risk factors such as unhealthy diet and sedentary lifestyle; limited access to risk-reducing behaviors such as chemoprevention, screening, and follow up of abnormal test results; or lack of access to high-quality treatment resources. These factors operate at the individual, provider, health system, community, and policy levels to perpetuate CRC disparities. However, CRC disparities can be eliminated. Addressing the complex factors that contribute to development and progression of CRC with multicomponent, adaptive interventions, at multiple levels of the care continuum, can reduce gaps in mortality. These might be addressed with a combination of healthcare and community-based interventions and policy changes that promote healthy behaviors and ensure access to high-quality and effective measures for CRC prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. Improving resources and coordinating efforts in communities where people of low-socioeconomic status live and work would increase access to evidence-based interventions. Research is also needed to understand the role and potential mechanisms by which factors in diet, intestinal , and/or inflammation contribute to differences in colorectal carcinogenesis. Studies of large cohorts with diverse populations are needed to identify epidemiologic and molecular factors that contribute to CRC development in different populations.Copyright © 2019 AGA Institute.

The present study aimed to determine the effect of consumption of native chicory inulin on the stool frequency of middle-aged to older adults (40-75 years old) with uncomfortably but not clinically relevant low stool frequency, specified as two to four days without bowel movements per week. Two randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled crossover trials were conducted using similar protocols in differing populations. Trial A was conducted in Amsterdam, The Netherlands and subsequently Trial B was conducted in Newcastle, United Kingdom. Both trials involved supplementation for 5 weeks with 10 g per day of inulin or placebo, a washout period of 2 weeks, and then crossed over to receive the other treatment. In Trial B, faecal gut  composition was assessed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. In Trial A, which 10 volunteers completed, the stool frequency was significantly increased to an average 4.9 ± 0.23 (SEM) times per week during inulin periods versus 3.6 ± 0.25 in the periods with placebo ( = 0.01). In contrast, in Trial B which 20 volunteers completed, there was no significant effect of the inulin on stool frequency (7.5 ± 2.1 times per week with inulin, 8.1 ± 3.0 with placebo,  = 0.35). However, many subjects in Trial B had a stool frequency >5 per week also for the placebo period, in breach of the inclusion criteria. Combining the data of 16 low stool frequency subjects from Trials A and B showed a significant effect of inulin to increase stool frequency from 4.1 to 5.0 per week ( = 0.032). Regarding secondary outcomes, stool consistency was significantly softer with inulin treatment compared to placebo periods, it increased 0.29 on the Bristol stool scale ( = 0.008) when data from all subjects of Trials A and B were combined. No other differences in bowel habit parameters due to inulin consumption were significant. None of the differences in specific bacterial abundance, alpha or beta diversity were significant, however the trends were in directions consistent with published studies on other types of inulin. We conclude that 10 g per day of native chicory inulin can increase stool frequency in subjects with low stool frequency.© 2019 The Authors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31682925>Effects of age, sex and diet on salivary nitrate and nitrite in infants.</a></h2><p>The inorganic anions nitrate and nitrite are oxidation products from endogenous nitric oxide (NO) generation and constituents in our diet. A nitrate-nitrite-NO pathway exists in which nitrate can be serially reduced to bioactive NO. The first step of this pathway occurs in the oral cavity where oral bacteria convert salivary nitrate to nitrite, whereafter nitrite is reduced to NO systemically by several enzymatic and non-enzymatic pathways. Data are scarce regarding salivary levels and oral conversion capacity of these anions in infants. We measured salivary nitrate and nitrate in infants at 4 and 12 months of age and related values to age, sex, dietary pattern and oral . Saliva was collected from a total of 188 infants at 4 and 12 months of age. Salivary nitrate, nitrite and nitrite/nitrate ratio as a measure of oral nitrate-reducing capacity were analyzed by HPLC and related to age, sex, type of diet (breast milk or formula) and oral . There was no difference in salivary nitrate, nitrite or nitrite/nitrate ratio between boys and girls at any age. At 4 months levels of these parameters were lower than what has been described in adults but they had all increased significantly at 12 months of age. At 4 months of age salivary nitrite/nitrate ratio was lower in breast-fed compared to formula-fed infants, but these differences disappeared at 12 months. Several bacterial species were associated with oral nitrate reducing capacity including Prevotella, Veillonella, Alloprevotella and Leptotrichia. We conclude that in infants there is an increase in salivary nitrate and nitrite as well as in oral nitrate-reductase capacity during the first year of life. Differences observed at 4 months of age between breast-fed and formula-fed infants disappear at one year of age.Copyright © 2019.

Although the exact mechanisms underlying the initial development of IBD are not fully understood, it is believed that an abnormal immune response is elicited against the intestinal  in genetically predisposed individuals. Crucial elements of the etiopathogenesis have been elucidated by research using human biological materials. The estimated prevalence of IBD is 0.5% in the Western world. Although incidence rates are increasing, both conditions are not "common" in general terms mandating a multicentric approach. Biological material from numerous Belgian patients have been collected over time in a number of university hospitals in Belgium (UH Ghent: 800 CD patients, 350 UC patients, 600 normal controls; UH Leuven: 2,600 CD patients, 1,380 UC patients, 98 IC/IBDU patients, 6,260 normal controls). Within the setting of the Flemish Center Medical Innovation (CMI) initiative and later on the Flemish biobank network a prospective study was set-up across three Belgian IBD centers (University Hospitals Brussels, Ghent, and Leuven). Human biological materials and data have been collected prospectively from newly diagnosed CD and UC patients. The analyses hereof have generated new insights which have been published in the most renowned journals. The approach of well-thought off, multi-centric, structured, and systematic biobanking has proven to be a success-story and thus a textbook case for multi-centric banking of human biological materials.

Here, we used high-throughput amplicon sequencing to assess size fractionated (0.2 and 5 μm) bacterial (16S) and phytoplankton assemblages (18S) associated with blooms of C. polykrikoides during recurrent blooms in NY, USA. Over a three-year period, samples were collected inside ('patch') and outside ('non-patch') dense accumulations of C. polykrikoides to assess the  associated with these blooms. Eukaryotic plankton communities of blooms had significantly lower diversity than non-bloom samples, and non-bloom samples hosted 30 eukaryotic operational taxonomic units (OTUs) not found within blooms, suggesting they may have been allelopathically excluded from blooms. Differential abundance analyses revealed that C. polykrikoides blooms were significantly enriched in dinoflagellates (p<0.001) and the experimental enrichment of C. polykrikoides led to a significant increase in the relative abundance of eight genera of dinoflagellates but a significant decline in other eukaryotic plankton. Amoebophrya co-dominated both within- and near- C. polykrikoides blooms and was more abundant in bloom patches. The core bacterial  of the >0.2μm fraction of blooms was dominated by an uncultured bacterium from the SAR11 clade, while the >5μm size fraction was co-dominated by an uncultured bacterium from Rhodobacteraceae and Coraliomargarita.

Here, we discovered that (R)-salbutamol, a β receptor agonist, inhibits and reprograms the cellular metabolism of RAW264.7 macrophages. (R)-salbutamol significantly inhibited LPS-induced M1 macrophage polarization and downregulated expressions of typical M1 macrophage cytokines, including monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and tumour necrosis factor α (TNF-α). Also, (R)-salbutamol significantly decreased the production of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), nitric oxide (NO) and reactive oxygen species (ROS), while increasing the reduced glutathione (GSH)/oxidized glutathione (GSSG) ratio. In contrast, (S)-salbutamol increased the production of NO and ROS. Bioenergetic profiles showed that (R)-salbutamol significantly reduced aerobic glycolysis and enhanced mitochondrial respiration. Untargeted metabolomics analysis demonstrated that (R)-salbutamol modulated metabolic pathways, of which three metabolic pathways, namely, (a) phenylalanine metabolism, (b) the pentose phosphate pathway and (c) glycerophospholipid metabolism were the most noticeably impacted pathways. The effects of (R)-salbutamol on M1 polarization were inhibited by a specific β receptor antagonist, ICI-118551. These findings demonstrated that (R)-salbutamol inhibits the M1 phenotype by downregulating aerobic glycolysis and glycerophospholipid metabolism, which may propose (R)-salbutamol as the major pharmacologically active component of racemic salbutamol for the treatment of inflammatory diseases and highlight the medicinal value of (R)-salbutamol.© 2019 The Authors.

Any condition (environmental, pharmacological/toxicological, physical, or neuro-humoral) that changes the vascular endothelium has great consequences for the organism's wellness and on the outcome and evolution of severe cardiovascular pathologies. Thus, knowledge of the mechanisms, both endogenous and external, that affect endothelial dysfunction is pivotal to preventing and treating these disorders. In recent decades, significant attention has been focused on gut  and how these symbiotic microorganisms can influence host health and disease development. Indeed, dysbiosis has been reported to be at the base of a range of different pathologies, including pathologies of the cardiovascular system. The study of the mechanism underlying this relationship has led to the identification of a series of metabolites (released by gut bacteria) that exert different effects on all the components of the vascular system, and in particular on endothelial cells. The imbalance of factors promoting or blunting endothelial cell viability and function and angiogenesis seems to be a potential target for the development of new therapeutic interventions.

Most methods for quantification of poly-P pools suffer from low accuracy and specificity. More powerful and implementable P-analysis tools are required for poly-P quantification, which will help in improved evaluation of processes in laboratory and full-scale EBPR systems. This study developed two methods to quantify poly-P pools by releasing the poly-P from the cell. During experimental optimization, it was observed that two different methods resulted in the highest phosphate release: acetate addition at a pH of 4.8 and exposure to EDTA solution with a concentration of 1% (w/v). Treatment with EDTA resulted in a higher amount of phosphate release from all sludge samples. This was characterized by P-release of 1.5-2.5 times higher than the control tests. In contrast, treatments with acetate addition at a low pH exhibited that P-release depended upon the types of the sludge samples. The highest P-release amount and rate were found in highly-enriched PAO sludge samples, but with fewer influences on the sludge collected from WWTP, which may be attributed to the lower fraction of PAOs in the sludge. Overall, the proposed approaches to quantify the poly-P concentration can be applied in simple, user-friendly, and cost-effective ways.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The aims of this study were to investigate how nylon (polyamide) microplastics may affect PBDE accumulation in snails, and the acute effects of nylon particles and PBDEs on survival, weight change and inherent  diversity and community composition of the pond snail Lymnaea stagnalis. Snails were exposed for 96 h to BDEs-47, 99, 100 and 153 in the presence and absence of 1% w/w nylon microplastics in quartz sand sediment. No mortality was observed over the exposure period. Snails not exposed to microplastics lost significantly more weight compared to those exposed to microplastics. Increasing PBDE concentration in the sediment resulted in an increased PBDE body burden in the snails, however microplastics did not significantly influence total PBDE uptake. Based on individual congeners, uptake of BDE 47 by snails was significantly reduced in the presence of microplastics. The diversity and composition of the snail  was not significantly altered by the presence of PBDEs nor by the microplastics, singly or combined. Significant effects on a few individual operational taxonomic units (OTUs) occurred when comparing the highest PBDE concentration with the control treatment, but in the absence of microplastics only. Overall within these acute experiments, only subtle effects on weight loss and slight  alterations occurred. These results therefore highlight that L. stagnalis are resilient to acute exposures to microplastics and PBDEs, and that microplastics are unlikely to influence HOC accumulation or the  of this species over short timescales.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Moreover, lower plasma betaine concentrations have been reported in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, few studies have explored the association of betaine with incident T2DM, especially in the general population. The goals of this study were to evaluate the performance of a newly developed betaine assay and to prospectively explore the potential clinical associations of betaine and future risk of T2DM in a large population-based cohort.We developed a high-throughput, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy procedure for acquiring spectra that allow for the accurate quantification of plasma/serum betaine and TMAO. Assay performance for betaine quantification was assessed and Cox proportional hazards regression was employed to evaluate the association of betaine with incident T2DM in 4336 participants in the Prevention of Renal and Vascular End-Stage Disease (PREVEND) study.Betaine assay results were linear (y = 1.02X - 3.75) over a wide range of concentrations (26.0-1135 µM). The limit of blank (LOB), limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantitation (LOQ) were 6.4, 8.9, and 13.2 µM, respectively. Coefficients of variation for intra- and inter-assay precision ranged from 1.5-4.3% and 2.5-5.5%, respectively. Deming regression analysis of results produced by NMR and liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry(LC-MS/MS) revealed an R value of 0.94 (Y = 1.08x - 1.89) and a small bias for higher values by NMR. The reference interval, in a cohort of apparently healthy adult participants ( = 501), was determined to be 23.8 to 74.7 µM (mean of 42.9 ± 12.6 µM). In the PREVEND study ( = 4336, excluding subjects with T2DM at baseline), higher betaine was associated with older age and lower body mass index, total cholesterol, triglycerides, and hsCRP. During a median follow-up of 7.3 (interquartile range (IQR), 5.9-7.7) years, 224 new T2DM cases were ascertained. Cox proportional hazards regression models revealed that the highest tertile of betaine was associated with a lower incidence of T2DM. Hazard ratio (HR) for the crude model was 0.61 (95% CI: 0.44-0.85,  = 0.004). The association remained significant even after adjusting for multiple clinical covariates and T2DM risk factors, including fasting glucose. HR for the fully-adjusted model was 0.50 (95% CI: 0.32-0.80,  = 0.003).The newly developed NMR-based betaine assay exhibits performance characteristics that are consistent with usage in the clinical laboratory.

This non-specific response to reinfection is a primitive form of adaptation that has been shown to be conserved from plants to mammals. Insects lack an acquired immune component and rely solely on an innate one, and they have expanded it upon traits of plasticity and adaptation against pathogens in the form of immune priming. The recent discoveries of the role of  in the insect's ecology and the ability of this yeast to induce trained immunity in different organisms suggest that insects could have developed mechanisms of adaptation and immune enhancing. Here, we report that two yeast strains of , previously shown to induce trained immunity in mammals, enhance resistance to  infection in the paper wasp . The reduction of injected  load by  strains was statistically significant in future foundresses but not in workers, and this occurs before and after hibernation. We thus investigated if the effect on  was mirrored by variation in the gut  composition.

However, the underlying mechanism of IBS is not fully understood. The aim of this study was to investigate potential mechanism and novel biomarkers of IBS through evaluation of the metabolomic and microbiologic profile.  Fecal samples were collected from 15 irritable bowel syndrome patients and 15 healthy controls. By using gas chromatography coupled to time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC-TOFMS) and 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing, fecal metabolites and  of healthy controls and the IBS patients were measured.  IBS patients had a significantly differential metabolite profile as compared to healthy controls, and 4 clusters with 31 metabolites, including a group of amino acids and fatty acids, were significantly up-regulated as compared to the healthy controls. In addition, 19 microbes were significantly up-regulated, and 12 microbes were down-regulated in the IBS group, when compared with the healthy controls. Some clusters of fecal metabolites or microorganisms were significantly correlated with the severity of IBS symptoms, such as the frequency of abdominal pain/discomfort and the number of bowel movements. Correlation of the metabolite levels with abundances of microbial genera showed some statistically significant metabolite-microbe associations. Four differentially abundant amino acids clustered together were positively correlated with some microbes, including , and so on.  The finding of this study puts a global perspective on metabolomics and  profiling in IBS patients and provides a theoretical basis for future research on pathophysiology of IBS.Copyright © 2019 Zhu, Liu, Li, Zhang, Zhang, Chen, Zhao, Chen, Gu, Min and Zhang.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31682463>Alterations in Oral  in HIV are Related to Decreased Pulmonary Function.</a></h2><p>Mechanisms of HIV-associated chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are poorly understood. The oral  shapes the lung  and gut dysbiosis can impact lung diseases; however, relationships of the oral and gut  to COPD in HIV have not been explored.To examine alterations in the oral and gut  associated with pulmonary disease in persons with HIV (PWH).75 PWH and 93 HIV-uninfected men from the Multicenter AIDS cohort study performed pulmonary function testing. Sequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA in saliva and stool was performed. We used non-metric multidimensional scaling, permutational multivariate analysis of variance and linear discriminant analysis to analyze communities by HIV and lung function.Oral  composition differed by HIV and smoking status. Alterations of oral microbial communities were observed in PWH with abnormal lung function with increases in relative abundance of Veillonella, Streptococcus and Lactobacillus. There were no significant associations between the oral  and lung function in HIV-uninfected individuals. No associations with HIV status or lung function were seen with the gut .Alterations of oral  in PWH were related to impaired pulmonary function and to systemic inflammation. These results suggest that the oral  may serve as a biomarker of lung function in HIV and that its disruption may contribute to COPD pathogenesis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31680937>Neuroinflammation and the Gut : Possible Alternative Therapeutic Targets to Counteract Alzheimer's Disease?</a></h2><p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex, multi-factorial disease affecting various brain systems. This complexity implies that successful therapies must be directed against several core neuropathological targets rather than single ones. The scientific community has made great efforts to identify the right AD targets beside the historic amyloid-β (Aβ). Neuroinflammation is re-emerging as determinant in the neuropathological process of AD. A new theory, still in its infancy, highlights the role of gut  (GM) in the control of brain development, but also in the onset and progression of neurodegenerative diseases. Bidirectional communication between the central and the enteric nervous systems, called gut-brain axes, is largely influenced by GM and the immune system is a potential key mediator of this interaction. Growing evidence points to the role of GM in the maturation and activation of host microglia and peripheral immune cells. Several recent studies have found abnormalities in GM (dysbiosis) in AD populations. These observations raise the intriguing question whether and how GM dysbiosis could contribute to AD development through action on the immune system and whether, in a therapeutic prospective, the development of strategies preserving a healthy GM might become a valuable approach to prevent AD. Here, we review the evidence from animal models and humans of the role of GM in neuroinflammation and AD.Copyright © 2019 Cerovic, Forloni and Balducci.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31693963>The emerging role of gut microbial metabolism on cardiovascular disease.</a></h2><p>The gut  has been implicated in the progression of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) including hypertension, dyslipidemia, atherosclerosis, thrombosis, heart failure, and ischemic stroke. Metabolomics studies in humans and diverse mouse populations have revealed associations between diet-derived gut bacterial metabolites, including trimethylamine-N-oxide, short-chain fatty acids, and intermediates of aromatic amino acid breakdown, with progression of CVD. Functional studies in animals fed diets of defined composition have been instrumental for establishing causal links between these metabolites, the microbes that produce them, dietary substrates and disease. The purpose of this review is to discuss recent progress in our understanding of how gut microbial metabolism of food influences the development of CVD and to outline experimental approaches that can be useful for addressing crucial knowledge gaps in the field.

However, studies on the MiTBamp in MDD are lacking. The aim of the present study was to analyze the gut  composition and the MiTBamp in MDD patients.We performed shotgun metagenomic sequencing of stool samples from 26 MDD patients and 29 healthy controls (HCs). In addition to the  community and the MiTBamp analyses, we also built a classification based on the Random Forests (RF) and Boruta algorithm to identify the gut  as biomarkers for MDD.The Bacteroidetes abundance was strongly reduced whereas that of Actinobacteria was significantly increased in the MDD patients compared with the abundance in the HCs. Most noteworthy, the MDD patients had increased levels of Bifidobacterium, which is commonly used as a probiotic. Four Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) orthologies (KOs) (K01817, K11358, K01626, K01667) abundances in the MiTBamp were significantly lower in the MDD group. Furthermore, we found a negative correlation between the K01626 abundance and the HAMD scores in the MDD group. Finally, RF classification at the genus level can achieve an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.890.The present findings enabled a better understanding of the changes in gut  and the related Trp pathway in MDD.

Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is the most serious form of NAFLD where inflammation causes liver damage that can progress to cirrhosis. We have characterized the gut  composition in UK patients with biopsy-proven NASH (n = 65) and compared it to that in healthy controls (n = 76). We report a 7% lower Shannon alpha diversity in NASH patients without cirrhosis (n = 40) compared to controls ( = 2.7x 10) and a 14% drop in NASH patients with cirrhosis (n = 25,  = 5.0x 10). Beta diversity (Unweighted UniFrac distance) was also significantly reduced in both NASH ( = 5.6x 10) and NASH-cirrhosis ( = 8.1x 10) groups. The genus most strongly associated with NASH in this study was  (0.29% abundance in controls, 3.45% in NASH without cirrhosis (False Discovery Rate (FDR)  = .008), and 4.38% in NASH with cirrhosis (FDR  = .02)). This genus, which has been linked previously to obesity and atherosclerosis, was also positively correlated with fasting levels of triglycerides ( = .01) and total cholesterol ( = 1.2x 10) and negatively correlated with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ( = 2.8x 10) suggesting that some of the pathways present in this microbial genus may influence lipid metabolism in the host. In patients, we also found decreased abundance of some of the  which are known to produce high levels of short-chain fatty acids which can lower inflammation.

It is currently unclear how complement integrates into our current model of molecular pathogenesis in HS and whether is represents a central component of pathogenesis, or a neutrophil-associated bystander. Levels of C5a in serum and tissue correlate with disease activity and degree of neutrophilic infiltrates in HS. C5a has been associated with Th17 immune axis activation in psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn's disease with strong similarities to TH17 activation in HS. Porphyromonas species (which are identified in the HS ) are able to cleave inactive C5 into C5a implicating the cutaneous  as an activator of complement. C3a and C5a are associated with activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, implicated in the inflammatory drive in HS. Complement receptors are present upon dendritic cells, monocytes, fibroblasts, and adipocytes which may broaden the potential contribution of complement to multiple aspects of HS pathogenesis. Dysregulation of complement receptor pathways have been documented in obesity, insulin resistance and polycystic ovarian syndrome leading to the possibility that complement may explain the epidemiological associations between these conditions and HS. The therapeutic potential of complement inhibitors in HS may be related to the therapeutic target (complement receptor or complement subunit), and the presence of alternate receptors (such as C5aR2) or ligands (including C3a, PAMPs and DAMPs). Integrating complement into the known pathogenesis of HS may aid in explaining the contradictory results between Phase 2 studies of C5a antagonists. It also allows for the identification of existing knowledge gaps to target further clinical investigation and research.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

However, most of the microbial antigens targeted by gut IgA remain unknown, and the functional effects of IgA targeting these antigens are currently understudied. This study provides a framework for identifying and characterizing gut  antigens targeted by gut IgA. We developed a small intestinal  culture assay to harvest lamina propria IgA from gnotobiotic mice, with the aim of identifying antigenic targets in a model human gut commensal,  VPI-5482. Colonization by  induced a microbe-specific IgA response that was reactive against diverse antigens, including capsular polysaccharides, lipopolysaccharides, and proteins. IgA against microbial protein antigens targeted membrane and secreted proteins with diverse functionalities, including an IgA specific against proteins of the polysaccharide utilization locus (PUL) that are necessary for utilization of fructan, which is an important dietary polysaccharide. Further analyses demonstrated that the presence of dietary fructan increased the production of fructan PUL-specific IgA, which then downregulated the expression of fructan PUL in , both  and  Since the expression of fructan PUL has been associated with the ability of  to colonize the gut in the presence of dietary fructans, our work suggests a novel role for gut IgA in regulating microbial colonization by modulating their metabolism. Given the significant impact that gut microbes have on our health, it is essential to identify key host and environmental factors that shape this diverse community. While many studies have highlighted the impact of diet on gut , little is known about how the host regulates this critical diet- interaction. In our present study, we discovered that gut IgA targeted a protein complex involved in the utilization of an important dietary polysaccharide: fructan. While the presence of dietary fructans was previously thought to allow unrestricted growth of fructan-utilizing bacteria, our work shows that gut IgA, by targeting proteins responsible for fructan utilization, provides the host with tools that can restrict the microbial utilization of such polysaccharides, thereby controlling their growth.Copyright © 2019 Joglekar et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31681786>Plant-Based Fat, Dietary Patterns Rich in Vegetable Fat and Gut  Modulation.</a></h2><p>Diet is advocated as a key factor influencing gut .

Ten 30-day-old male yak calves were randomly assigned to 2 groups. The maternal grazing (MG) group was maternally nursed and grazed, and the early weaning (EW) group was supplied milk replacer, starter feed, and alfalfa hay twice per day. Compared with the yak calves in the MG group, the yak calves in the EW group showed significantly increased body weight, body height, body length, and chest girth. When suffering to the potential mechanism of improved growth of yak calves, except for the enhanced ruminal fermentation, the significantly increased total volatile fatty acids, propionate, butyrate, isobutyrate, and valerate in the caecum in the EW group could also serve to promote the growth of calves. By using 16S rDNA sequencing, some significantly increased caecal phylum and genera, which were all related to the enhanced caecal fermentation by utilizing both the fibrous and non-fibrous carbohydrates, were identified in the EW group. In conclusion, early weaning of yak calves by supplying them with alfalfa hay, starter feed, and milk replacer is more beneficial to the growth of yak calves when compared with maternal grazing and nursing, in part due to alterations in caecal  and fermentation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31681235>The Impact of Type VI Secretion System, Bacteriocins and Antibiotics on Bacterial Competition of  subsp.  and the Regulation of Carbapenem Biosynthesis by Iron and the Ferric-Uptake Regulator.</a></h2><p>The complexity of plant microbial communities provides a rich model for investigating biochemical and regulatory strategies involved in interbacterial competition. Within these niches, the soft rot  (SRE) represents an emerging group of plant-pathogens causing soft rot/blackleg diseases resulting in economic losses worldwide in a variety of crops.

Subsequent to this, a range of molecular and computational techniques were used to determine the contribution of antimicrobial factors such as bacteriocins, carbapenem and type VI secretion system (T6SS), found in an aggressive SRE ( subsp.  strain PBR1692 - 1692) against these endophytes/plant pathogens. The results showed growth inhibition of several  by 1692 depends either on carbapenem or pyocin production. Whereas for targeted , only the 1692 pyocin seems to play a role in growth inhibition. Furthermore, production of carbapenem by 1692 was observably dependent on the presence of environmental iron and oxygen. Additionally, upon deletion of , A and I regulators, carbapenem production ceased, implying a complex regulatory mechanism involving these three genes. Finally, the results demonstrated that although T6SS confers no relevant advantage during  competition, a significant attenuation in competition by the mutant strain lacking a functional T6SS was observed .Soft rot  (SRE) represents important phytopathogens causing soft rot/blackleg diseases in a variety of crops leading to huge economic losses worldwide. These pathogens have been isolated alongside other bacteria from different environments such as potato tubers, stems, roots and from the soil. In these environments, SREs coexist with other bacteria where they have to compete for scarce nutrients and other resources. In this report, we show that  subsp.  strain PBR1692 - 1692, which represents one of the SREs, inhibits growth of several different bacteria by producing different antimicrobial compounds. These antimicrobial compounds can be secreted inside or outside the plant host, allowing 1692 to effectively colonize different types of ecological niches. By analyzing the genome sequences of several SREs, we show that other SREs likely deploy similar antimicrobials to target other bacteria.Copyright © 2019 Shyntum, Nkomo, Shingange, Gricia, Bellieny-Rabelo and Moleleki.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31681625>Species-Level Salivary Microbial Indicators of Well-Resolved Periodontitis: A Preliminary Investigation.</a></h2><p> To profile the salivary microbiomes of a Hong Kong Chinese cohort at a species-level resolution and determine species that discriminated clinically resolved periodontitis from periodontally healthy cases.

Determining the taxonomic origin of microbial sequences is one of the first, and frequently only, analysis performed on  samples. Substantial research has focused on the development of methods for taxonomic annotation, often making trade-offs in computational efficiency and classification accuracy. A side-effect of these efforts has been a reexamination of the bacterial taxonomy itself. Taxonomies developed prior to the genomic revolution captured complex relationships between organisms that went beyond uniform taxonomic levels such as species, genus, and family. Driven in part by the need to simplify computational workflows, the bacterial taxonomies used most commonly today have been regularized to fit within a standard seven taxonomic levels. Consequently, modern analyses of microbial communities are relatively coarse-grained. Few methods make classifications below the genus level, impacting our ability to capture biologically relevant signals. Here, we present ATLAS, a novel strategy for taxonomic annotation that uses significant outliers within database search results to group sequences in the database into partitions. These partitions capture the extent of taxonomic ambiguity within the classification of a sample. The ATLAS pipeline can be found on GitHub [https://github.com/shahnidhi/outlier_in_BLAST_hits]. We demonstrate that ATLAS provides similar annotations to phylogenetic placement methods, but with higher computational efficiency. When applied to human  data, ATLAS is able to identify previously characterized taxonomic groupings, such as those in the class  and the genus . Furthermore, the majority of partitions identified by ATLAS are at the subgenus level, replacing higher-level annotations with specific groups of species.

Phylogenetic analyses suggest the early acquisition of several bacterial genes in a common ancestor of both lineages. Those LGTs most likely facilitated the adaptation of the free-living ancestor of the Opalinidae-Blastocystis symbiotic group to new niches in the oxygen-depleted animal gut environment.© The Author(s) 2019.

Current treatments for IBS are unsatisfactory due to its multifactorial pathogenesis involving the -gut-brain axis. Lactobacillus plantarum PS128 (PS128) was reported to exhibit neuromodulatory activity which may be beneficial for improving IBS. This study aimed to investigate the effect of PS128 on visceral hypersensitivity (VH) and the gut-brain axis using a 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP)-induced VH rat model without colonic inflammation induction, mimicking the characteristics of IBS. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were administered with PS128 (10 CFU in 0.2 mL saline/rat/day) or saline (0.2 mL saline/rat/day) for 14 days. Colorectal distension (CRD) with simultaneous electromyography recording was performed 30 min before and 30 min after the 5-HTP injection. Levels of neuropeptides and neurotrophins were analyzed. PS128 significantly reduced VH induced by the 5-HTP injection and CRD. Neurotransmitter protein levels, substance P, CGRP, BDNF, and NGF, were decreased in the dorsal root ganglion but increased in the spinal cord in response to the 5-HTP injection; PS128 reversed these changes. The hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis was modulated by PS128 with decreased corticosterone concentration in serum and the expression of mineralocorticoid receptors in the amygdala. Oral administration of PS128 inhibited 5-HTP-induced VH during CRD. The ameliorative effect on VH suggests the potential application of PS128 for IBS.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31685533>Flexible cobamide metabolism in  ( 630 Δ.</a></h2><p> is an opportunistic pathogen known for its ability to colonize the human gut under conditions of dysbiosis.

To address the importance of cobamides to , we studied  630 Δ and mutant derivatives under cobamide-dependent conditions  Our results show that  can use a surprisingly diverse array of cobamides for methionine and deoxyribonucleotide synthesis, and can use alternative metabolites or enzymes, respectively, to bypass these cobamide-dependent processes.  630 Δ produces the cobamide pseudocobalamin when provided the early precursor 5-aminolevulinc acid or the late intermediate cobinamide, and produces other cobamides if provided an alternative lower ligand. The ability of  630 Δ to take up cobamides and Cbi at micromolar or lower concentrations requires the transporter BtuFCD. Genomic analysis revealed genetic variations in in the  locus of different  strains, which may result in differences in the ability to take up cobamides and Cbi. These results together demonstrate that, like other aspects of its physiology, cobamide metabolism in  is versatile. The ability of the opportunistic pathogen  to cause disease is closely linked to its propensity to adapt to conditions created by dysbiosis of the human gut . The cobamide (vitamin B) metabolism of  has been underexplored, though it has seven metabolic pathways that are predicted to require cobamide-dependent enzymes. Here, we show that  cobamide metabolism is versatile, as it can use a surprisingly wide variety of cobamides and has alternative functions that can bypass some of its cobamide requirements. Furthermore,  does not synthesize cobamides , but produces them when given cobamide precursors.

The conservation of many noncharismatic species is hampered by the lack of data. Yet, natural history research-a major source of information on noncharismatic species-is in decline. We here suggest a remedy for many mammal species, i.e., metagenomic clean-up of fecal samples that are "crowdsourced" during routine field surveys. Based on literature data, we estimate that this approach could yield natural history information for circa 1,000 species within a decade. Metagenomic analysis would simultaneously yield natural history data on diet and gut parasites while enhancing our understanding of host genetics, gut , and the functional interactions between traditional and new natural history data.

Here, we characterized the gut  of the  species complex from Central America (known as the Midas cichlid complex), encompassing 158 wild specimens (13 species) collected from seven Nicaraguan lakes, and combined these data with previously published data from two African lakes (spanning 29 species). Our aim was to comprehensively explore trends in  variation and persistence along the large spatial and temporal scales of cichlid diversification (from the oldest radiation in L. Tanganyika, 9-12 My old, to young ones in Nicaraguan crater lakes, <0.5 My old), in allopatry and sympatry (within and across lakes), and across the range of dietary niches (from highly specialized to generalist feeders). Despite their extraordinary diversity, cichlids shared a remarkably conserved microbial taxonomic profile, which argues for a primary role of the host genetics in the assembly and maintenance of these microbial communities. Within this partly constrained  profile, geographic isolation (continent and lake) represented the first level of discrimination. For the Midas cichlid, a partial congruency was found between host  and genetic distances, suggesting that microbial communities have partly diversified along their cichlid phylogeographic history of crater lake colonization. In sympatry (within lakes), the young and poorly ecologically diversified cichlid assemblages of Central American lakes display largely unresolved gut microbiotas (in terms of both alpha and beta diversities), whereas the phylogenetically and ecologically diverse species found in African lakes showed greater microbial interspecific diversity. This pattern largely points to the level of habitat segregation, trophic niche overlap, and reproductive barriers as major modulators of the gut  connectivity among sympatric species.Copyright © 2019 Baldo, Riera, Salzburger and Barluenga.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31685095>Oropharyngeal  in Obstructive Sleep Apnea: Decreased Diversity and Abundance.</a></h2><p>To explore and analyze diversity and abundance of oropharyngeal  in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA).This was a cross-sectional study. Middle-aged men, suspected to have OSA, referred to full-night polysomnography, and willing to provide oropharyngeal swab samples, were consecutively enrolled. OSA severity was assessed by apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) as non-OSA (AHI < 5 events/h) and OSA (AHI ≥ 15 events/h). Bacterial DNA of oropharyngeal samples was extracted and quality test performed. Oropharyngeal  was analyzed using 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) sequencing, and bioinformatic analysis carried out after sequencing.Samples from 51 men (25 in the non-OSA group and 26 in the OSA group) were sent for examination. Of these, 40 samples were found to have sufficient concentration of DNA and were analyzed for bioinformatics. In alpha diversity analysis, the OSA group exhibited significantly lower sobs (198.33 ± 21.71 versus 216.57 ± 26.21, P = .022), chao (221.30 ± 26.62 versus 243.86 ± 26.20, P = .014), ace (222.17 ± 27.15 versus 242.42 ± 25.81, P = .028) and shannon index (3.14 ± 0.23 versus 3.31 ± 0.26, P = .035), suggesting a reduction in microbial species diversity. We further divided participants into non-OSA, moderate OSA, and severe OSA groups and observed a significant decrease in the bacterial biodiversity of OSA groups compared with the non-OSA group, with the most significant decrease occurring in the moderate OSA group. Principal coordinate analysis showed two extremely different oropharyngeal microbial communities in non-OSA and OSA groups. More interestingly, proportion of Neisseria was slightly higher in the severe OSA group (20.64%), followed by the moderate OSA and non-OSA groups (12.57% and 9.69%, respectively).

Therefore, we investigated the impact of  on immune response and intestinal  during the development of NE in chickens, including experimental stages with basal diets, high-fishmeal-supplementation diets, and  challenge. Chickens were divided into two groups from day 1 to day 20: one group had its diet supplemented with  supplementation and one did not. At day 20, the chickens were divided into four groups:  challenged and unchallenged chickens with and without  supplementation. All groups were fed a basal diet for 13 days and thereafter a basal diet with 50% fishmeal from day 14 to 24. Chickens were infected with  from day 21 to 23. At days 13, 20 and 24, samples were collected for analysis of the relative expression of immune response and intestinal mucosa barrier-related genes and intestinal microbes. The results show that  can inhibit the increase in IL-17A gene expression and the reduction in Claudin-1 gene induced-expression caused by  challenge. Moreover,  was found to increase the expression of anti-inflammatory IL-10 in infected chickens. Although  was found to have a significant beneficial effect on the structure of intestinal bacteria in the basal diet groups and decrease the abundance of  in the gut, it did not significantly affect the occurrence of intestinal lesions and did not significantly correct the shift in gut bacterial composition post  infection. In conclusion, although  promotes the expression of anti-inflammatory and tight junction protein genes and inhibits pro-inflammatory genes in challenged chickens, it is not adequate to improve the structure of intestinal  in NE chickens. Therefore, more effective schemes of  supplementation to prevent and treat NE in chickens need to be identified.Copyright © 2019 Huang, Peng, Gao, Wei, Xiang, Yuan and Xu.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31685450>Gut  and adaptive immunity in schizophrenia.</a></h2><p>Over the past few years, immunopathogenesis has emerged as one of the most compelling aetiopathological models of schizophrenia (SCZ), suggesting a chronic, immune-based, low-grade inflammatory background of this devastating disorder.1,2 Mounting evidence points towards a prominent role of the adaptive immune system in SCZ, suggesting alterations in defense mechanisms, such as altered T-cell function and a shift towards B-cell immunity.3 Immune cells have the ability to infiltrate the brain and mediate a neuroimmune cross-talk through activation of microglia, production of proinflammatory cytokines and reactive oxygen species, leading to neuroinflammation, as mediator of neuroprogressive and neurodegenerative changes in SCZ.4 Antipsychotic drugs, commonly used to treat SCZ, are also known to affect the adaptive immune system, interfering with the differentiation and function of immune cells, towards their normalization in response to treatment. Adaptive immunity is principally founded on T-cell and B-cell populations, but also includes the host . The gastrointestinal  is a complex ecosystem with a great organism diversity and refined genomic structure that resides in the intestinal tract and has a central position in human health and disease.5 Neuroimmune dysregulation, relying of the highly sensitive and fine-tuned equilibrium between  and adaptive immunity, can tip the scales towards neuroinflammation and disruption of higher-order brain networks.4,6,7 During the last decade, the human  and the -gut-brain (MGB)-axis have become a novel epicentre in mental health research as a potentially vital new determinant in the field of neuroimmunoregulation, brain development, emotions, cognition and behaviour.7 The MGB-axis represents a bidirectional, key communication pathway between the immune system and the brain, thus partly also mediating the regulation of cognitive and emotional processing. An imbalanced human  might greatly influence proper neuroimmune reactions and neurodevelopment with long-lasting effects and could thus play a pivotal role in the susceptibility and aetiology of psychiatric illness. Recent research offers first evidence that patients with SCZ show marked disturbances of gut bacterial taxa composition with a decreased  diversity index, party associated with specific SCZ phenotype, symptom severity and treatment response.8,9 As the elegant education of the adaptive immune compartment depends on the colonization niche, antigen type and metabolic property of different gut microbes, T-cell differentiation as well as a continuous diversification of B-cell repertoire is expressed through -related, antigen-specific receptors that define a unique clonotype.10 However, there is only sparse evidence on the precise role of the  on the programming of T- and B-cells in the underlying neurobiological pathways of SCZ and even less findings on the association of molecular T- and B-cell receptor repertoire signature and  clonal landscape with specific phenotypical features of the disease.11 The latest conceptual advances in immunology urge an integrative re-evaluation of previous immunological findings in SCZ through modern approaches. High-throughput, next-generation sequencing (NGS) represents a powerful singlecell transcriptomic tool to profile the whole clonal landscape of T and B cells and human . NGS thus offers a unique opportunity for in-depth characterization of cellular and molecular signatures of adaptive immune receptor repertoires and  taxonomy in SCZ and investigation of their intersection as a relevant pathway of disease progression and phenotype differentiation. SCZ patients are likely to show a diverging host- immune homeostasis with disease-specific clonotypes of adaptive immune receptor repertoires associated with altered  taxonomy and molecular signature differences, which, in turn, may be related to distinct symptomatic phenotypes and neurocognitive patterns. Such sophisticated immuno-bioinformatic analyses may transform our understanding of SCZ by identification of novel neuroimmune pathways, offering us clinically accessible symptomatic and diagnostic biomarkers important for personalized medicine implications.12 An increased understanding and better characterization of immuno-phenotypes in SCZ will better guide the development of novel immune-based treatments in this severe disease and pave the way for possible prevention options through implementation of antibody engineering, vaccine design, and cellular immunotherapy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695125>Publisher Correction: Effect of endogenous  on the molecular composition of cloud water: a study by Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS).</a></h2><p>An amendment to this paper has been published and can be accessed via a link at the top of the paper.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31698159>Tracing the evolutionary routes of plant- interactions.</a></h2><p>The  thriving at the root-soil interface plays a crucial role in supporting plant growth, development and health.

Anaerobic soil disinfestation (ASD) has potential as a biologically regulated disease control method; however, the role of specific metabolites and microbial community dynamics contributing to ASD mediated disease control is mostly uncharacterized. Understanding the trajectory of co-evolutionary processes leading to syntrophic generation of functional metabolites during ASD is a necessary prelude to the predictive utilization of this disease management approach. Consequently, metabolic and microbial community profiling were used to generate highly dimensional datasets and network analysis to identify sequential transformations through aerobic, facultatively anaerobic, and anaerobic soil phases of the ASD process and distinct groups of metabolites and microorganisms linked with those stages. Transient alterations in abundance of specific microbial groups, not consistently accounted for in previous studies of the ASD process, were documented in this time-course study. Such events initially were associated with increases and subsequent diminution in highly labile metabolites conferred by the carbon input. Proliferation and dynamic compositional changes in the Firmicutes community continued throughout the anaerobic phase and was linked to temporal changes in metabolite abundance including accumulation of small chain organic acids, methyl sulfide compounds, hydrocarbons, and -cresol with antimicrobial properties. Novel potential modes of disease control during ASD were identified and the importance of the amendment and "community metabolism" for temporally supplying specific classes of labile compounds were revealed.Copyright © 2019 Hewavitharana, Klarer, Reed, Leisso, Poirier, Honaas, Rudell and Mazzola.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31688969>Physiology of the Incretin Hormones, GIP and GLP-1-Regulation of Release and Posttranslational Modifications.</a></h2><p>The focus of this article is on the analysis of the release and postrelease fate of the incretin hormones, glucagon-like peptide-1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide.

As the most abundant maternally inherited microbe in animals,  manipulate host reproduction via reproductive parasitism strategies, including cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI). CI manifests as embryonic death when -modified sperm fertilize uninfected eggs but not maternally infected eggs. Thus, CI can provide a relative fitness advantage to -infected females and drive the infection through a population. In the genetic model , the  strain Mel induces variable CI, making mechanistic studies in  cumbersome. Here, we demonstrate that sons of older paternal  grandmothers induce stronger CI than sons of younger paternal grandmothers, and we term this relationship the "aternal randmother ge ffect" (PGAE). Moreover, the embryos and adult sons of older  grandmothers have higher  densities, correlating with their ability to induce stronger CI. In addition, we report that  density positively correlates with female age and decreases after mating, suggesting that females transmit  loads that are proportional to their own titers. These findings reveal a transgenerational impact of age on Mel-induced CI, elucidate  density dynamics in , and provide a methodological advance to studies aimed at understanding Mel-induced CI in the  model. Unidirectional cytoplasmic incompatibility (CI) results in a postfertilization incompatibility between -infected males and uninfected females. CI contributes to reproductive isolation between closely related species and is used in worldwide vector control programs to drastically lower arboviral vector population sizes or to replace populations that transmit arboviruses with those resistant to transmission. Despite decades of research on the factors that influence CI, penetrance is often variable under controlled laboratory conditions in various arthropods, suggesting that additional variables influence CI strength. Here, we demonstrate that paternal  grandmother age influences the strength of CI induced by their sons. Older  females have higher  densities and produce offspring with higher  densities that associate with stronger CI.

Consequently, no targetted pharmaceutical treatments or preventative interventions are available. The current article reviews the available data on the biological underpinnings of BPD, highlighting a role for early developmental processes, including prenatal stress and maternal dysbiosis, in BPD pathoetiology. Such factors are proposed to drive alterations in the infant's gut , in turn modulating amygdala development and the amygdala's two-way interactions with other brain regions.Alterations in opioidergic activity, including variations in the ratio of the mu-and kappa-opioid receptors seem a significant aspect of BPD pathophysiology, contributing to its comorbidities with depression, anxiety, impulsivity and addiction. Stress and dysphoria are commonly experienced in people classed with BPD. A growing body of data, across a host of medical conditions, indicate that stress and mood dysregulation may be intimately associated with gut dysbiosis and increased gut permeability, coupled to heightened levels of oxidative stress and immune-inflammatory activity. It urgently requires investigation as to the relevance of such gut changes in the course of BPD symptomatology. Accumulating data indicates that BPD symptom exacerbations may be linked to cyclical variations in estrogen, in turn decreasing serotonin and local melatonin synthesis, and thereby overlapping with the pathophysiology of migraine and endometriosis, which also have a heightened association with BPD.

In this work, the focus was on finding an energetically more competitive system to remove tetra-azo dye Direct Black 22 (DB22). We operated two upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactors (R1 and R2) in three phases (PI, PII, and PIII). R1 was operated as a conventional UASB, while R2 was microaerated in the upper part (0.18 ± 0.05 mg O. L), aiming to remove DB22 simultaneously with the aromatic amine byproducts. PI consisted of feeding reactors with synthetic textile wastewater (STW), PII had higher salinity in the STW, and PIII was the same as PII, plus sulfate. The results showed that color and COD removal efficiencies were similar for both reactors (67-72% for R1 and 59-78% for R2) without a substantial influence of oxygen in R2. However, microaeration played a crucial role in R2 by removing the anaerobically formed aromatic amines; during PIII, the effluent was 16 times less toxic than that of R1. The microbial community that developed in the sludge bed of both reactors was quite similar, with the core  represented by Trichococcus, Syntrophus and Methanosaeta genera. The increase in salinity in PII and PIII promoted a shift in the microbial community, excluding salty-sensitive genera from the core . The putative genera Brevundimonas and Ornatilinea were associated to aromatic amine microaerobic removal.

Activated sludge (AS) in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) has been proposed as a hotspot for ARGs. However, few studies have been conducted to uncover the temporal dynamics of the resistome of AS in WWTPs by long-term longitudinal sampling. In this study, we quantified ARGs and identified their host  in a Hong Kong WWTP in 97 monthly AS samples spanning 9 years. Throughout this analysis, we demonstrated that both the abundance and structures of the resistome changed significantly every two to three years, implying that there was a successive selection of resistomes in the AS system over the study period. The detection of genes of antibiotic-resistant pathogens that are emerging major threats to public health in the AS samples, including mcr, CRE (carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae) and MRSA (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus)-related genes, highlight the role of WWTPs as reservoirs of ARGs. In addition, the core resistome (abundant and persistent genes) in AS were found to overlap with those in other ecosystems such as urban sewage, livestock feces, and fishpond sediments, revealing the broad dissemination of ARGs in WWTPs and other environments. Annual variation of resistomes were explained via structural equation modeling (SEM), which deciphered the structural linkages of determining factors such as the operational parameters, microbial community composition and horizontal gene transfer (HGT). Specifically, potentially relevant antibiotic resistance bacteria (ARBs) were explored and discussed based on assembly-based analyses and network correlations. Moreover, consistent with the clear relationship between resistomes and mobile genetic elements (MGEs), it was found that there was a relatively high potential for gene exchange in AS in comparison with soil genomes, which could be explained by the engineering features of WWTPs. Based on these findings, longitudinal monitoring of WWTPs is warranted for risk assessment to reveal emerging ARGs, resistome evolution, correlations with ARBs, and the potential for spread in downstream environments and concomitant exposure risks for humans.Copyright © 2019.

Thus, CD4 Tconv cells can differentiate into both RORγ and Helios pTreg cells, providing a physiological adaptation of colonic Treg cells as a function of the age of the cell or of the individual.© 2019 Pratama et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31681025>Corrigendum: Physiological and Biochemical Effects of Intrinsically High and Low Exercise Capacities Through Multiomics Approaches.</a></h2><p>[This corrects the article DOI: 10.3389/fphys.2019.01201.].Copyright © 2019 Tung, Hsu, Liao, Ho, Huang and Huang.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31695050>Comparison of oral  profiles in stimulated and unstimulated saliva, tongue, and mouth-rinsed water.</a></h2><p>Epidemiological studies using saliva have revealed relationships between the oral  and many oral and systemic diseases. However, when collecting from a large number of participants such as a large-scale cohort study, the time it takes to collect saliva can be a problem. Mouth-rinsed water, which is water that has been used to rinse the oral cavity, can be used as an alternative method for collecting saliva for oral  analysis because it can be collected in a shorter time than saliva. The purpose of this study was to verify whether mouth-rinsed water is a suitable saliva substitute for analyzing the oral . We collected samples of mouth-rinsed water, stimulated saliva, unstimulated saliva, and tongue coating from 10 systemic healthy participants, and compared the microbial diversity and composition of the samples using next-generation sequencing of 16S rRNA-encoding genes. The results showed that the microbial diversity of mouth-rinsed water was similar to that of unstimulated and stimulated saliva, and significantly higher than that of tongue-coating samples. The microbial composition at the species level of mouth-rinsed water also showed a very high correlation with the composition of unstimulated and stimulated saliva. These results suggest that the mouth-rinsed water is a suitable collection method instead of saliva for oral  analysis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31690672>DNA- and RNA-SIP Reveal  spp. as Key Drivers of Nitrification in Groundwater-Fed Biofilters.</a></h2><p>Nitrification, the oxidative process converting ammonia to nitrite and nitrate, is driven by microbes and plays a central role in the global nitrogen cycle. Our earlier investigations based on 16S rRNA and  amplicon analysis,  quantitative PCR and metagenomics of groundwater-fed biofilters indicated a consistently high abundance of comammox  Here, we hypothesized that these nonclassical nitrifiers drive ammonia-N oxidation. Hence, we used DNA and RNA stable isotope probing (SIP) coupled with 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing to identify the active members in the biofilter community when subjected to a continuous supply of NH  or NO  in the presence of C-HCO  (labeled) or C-HCO  (unlabeled). Allylthiourea (ATU) and sodium chlorate were added to inhibit autotrophic ammonia- and nitrite-oxidizing bacteria, respectively. Our results confirmed that lineage II  dominated ammonia oxidation in the biofilter community. A total of 78 (8 by RNA-SIP and 70 by DNA-SIP) and 96 (25 by RNA-SIP and 71 by DNA-SIP)  phylotypes (at 99% 16S rRNA sequence similarity) were identified as complete ammonia- and nitrite-oxidizing, respectively. We also detected significant HCO  uptake by  subgroup10, , , and  under conditions that favored ammonia oxidation. Canonical  alone drove nitrite oxidation in the biofilter community, and activity of archaeal ammonia-oxidizing taxa was not detected in the SIP fractions. This study provides the first  evidence of ammonia oxidation by comammox  in an ecologically relevant complex . With this study we provide the first  evidence of ecologically relevant ammonia oxidation by comammox  in a complex  and document an unexpectedly high HCO  uptake and growth of proteobacterial and acidobacterial taxa under ammonia selectivity. This finding raises the question of whether comammox  is an equally important ammonia oxidizer in other environments.Copyright © 2019 Gülay et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31692924>Effect of poly(3-hydroxyalkanoates) as natural polymers on mesenchymal stem cells.</a></h2><p>Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are stromal multipotent stem cells that can differentiate into multiple cell types, including fibroblasts, osteoblasts, chondrocytes, adipocytes, and myoblasts, thus allowing them to contribute to the regeneration of various tissues, especially bone tissue. MSCs are now considered one of the most promising cell types in the field of tissue engineering. Traditional petri dish-based culture of MSCs generate heterogeneity, which leads to inconsistent efficacy of MSC applications. Biodegradable and biocompatible polymers, poly(3-hydroxyalkanoates) (PHAs), are actively used for the manufacture of scaffolds that serve as carriers for MSC growth. The growth and differentiation of MSCs grown on PHA scaffolds depend on the physicochemical properties of the polymers, the 3D and surface microstructure of the scaffolds, and the biological activity of PHAs, which was discovered in a series of investigations. The mechanisms of the biological activity of PHAs in relation to MSCs remain insufficiently studied. We suggest that this effect on MSCs could be associated with the natural properties of bacteria-derived PHAs, especially the most widespread representative poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) (PHB). This biopolymer is present in the bacteria of mammalian , whereas endogenous poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) is found in mammalian tissues. The possible association of PHA effects on MSCs with various biological functions of poly(3-hydroxybutyrate) in bacteria and eukaryotes, including in humans, is discussed in this paper.©The Author(s) 2019.

These microorganisms play a key role in plant growth and adaptation to adverse conditions, such as producing growth factors to promote plant growth and inhibiting pathogens to protect host plants. The composition of microbial communities very greatly amongst different plant species, yet there is little data on the composition of the  of the host plants on the coral island in the South China Sea. In this study, we investigated the abundances and members of a major microbial community (fungi, bacteria, and diazotrophs) on the leaves of five dominant plant species (, , , , and ) on the island using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and high-throughput amplicon sequencing. Quantitative PCR results showed that fungi and bacteria were ubiquitous and variable among different host plants.  showed the lowest absolute abundance and highest diversity of fungi and bacteria, while  had the lowest abundance and the highest diversity of diazotrophs compare to the other four plants. There was a small proportion of shared microorganisms among the five different plants, while unique fungi, bacteria and diazotrophs were significantly enriched for different host plant species in this study ( < 0.05). Some of the most abundant organisms found in the communities of these different host plants are involved in important biogeochemical cycles that can benefit their host, including carbon and nitrogen cycles.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31689519>Phloretin ameliorates dextran sulfate sodium-induced ulcerative colitis in mice by regulating the gut .</a></h2><p>Phloretin, extracted from the pericarp and velamen of apples or pears, is a dihydrochalcone flavonoid with anti-bacterial and anti-inflammatory activities. It has been reported that phloretin has anti-inflammatory effects in ulcerative colitis (UC) mice. However, the role of the gut  in the phloretin anti-UC process remains unclear. In this study, we observed that the anti-UC effect of phloretin was affected by co-housing, probably because of the transmissible nature of the gut micobiota. Through fecal micobiota transplantation (FMT), the effects of the gut  on the anti-UC of phloretin were further confirmed. UC was induced in mice by administrating 3% dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in drinking water for 7 days. Phloretin (60 mg/kg) was administered by gavage every day during the experiment. Fecal microbes (10 CFU/mL) from phloretin-treated UC mice were administered by gavage to non-phloretin-treated UC mice for 7 days. The results showed that FMT, like phloretin, ameliorated UC by improving disease symptoms and colon inflammation, balancing inflammatory cytokines, maintaining intestinal barrier integrity, restoring systemic immune function, inhibiting NF-κB and NLRP3 inflammasome activation and ameliorating the oxidant stress. Both FMT and phloretin treatment increased the levels of Bacteroidetes, Alistipes and Lactobacillus and decreased those of Firmicutes, Oscillibacter and Ruminiclostridium_6. Correlation analysis between gut microbes and micro-environmental factors revealed that Alistipes abundance was negatively correlated with DAI, pathological score, and TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β levels, and Alistipes was more abundant in phloretin or FMT treated UC mice. Oscillibacter abundance was significantly positively correlated with IL-6 and IL-1β levels and pathological score, and Oscillibacter was increased in UC mice. Furthermore, network analysis of the dominant genera revealed that Alistipes abundance was negatively related to Oscillibacter abundance. In conclusion, this study suggests that the anti-UC effects of phloretin are achieved through regulation of the gut  and phloretin has the potential to be developed as a promising agent for the treatment of UC.Copyright © 2019.

New approaches are needed to improve respiratory health and reduce premature mortality of chronic diseases by 30% till 2030 (UN Sustainable Development Goals, SDGs). Planetary health is defined as the health of human civilization and the state of the natural systems on which it depends. Planetary health and human health are interconnected, and both need to be considered by individuals and governments while addressing several SDGs.The concept of the Nature Step has evolved from innovative research indicating, how changed lifestyle in urban surroundings reduces contact with biodiverse environments, impoverishes , affects immune regulation and increases risk of NCDs. The Nature Step calls for strengthening connections to nature. Physical activity in natural environments should be promoted, use of fresh vegetables, fruits and water increased, and consumption of sugary drinks, tobacco and alcohol restricted. Nature relatedness should be part of everyday life and especially emphasized in the care of children and the elderly. Taking "nature" to modern cities in a controlled way is possible but a challenge for urban planning, nature conservation, housing, traffic arrangements, energy production, and importantly for supplying and distributing food. Actions against the well-known respiratory risk factors, air pollution and smoking, should be taken simultaneously.In Finland and elsewhere in Europe, successful programmes have been implemented to reduce the burden of respiratory disorders and other NCDs. Unhealthy behaviour can be changed by well-coordinated actions involving all stakeholders. The growing public health concern caused by NCDs in urban surroundings cannot be solved by health care alone; a multidisciplinary approach is mandatory.© The Author(s) 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31681810>Respiratory Dysbiosis in Canine Bacterial Pneumonia: Standard Culture vs.  Sequencing.</a></h2><p>It is unknown how the respiratory  influences and is influenced by bacterial pneumonia in dogs, as culture of lung samples and not microbial sequencing guides clinical practice. While accurate identification of pathogens are essential for treatment, not all bacteria are cultivable and the impact of respiratory dysbiosis on development of pneumonia is unclear. The study purposes were to (1) characterize the lung  in canine bacterial pneumonia and compare deviations in dominant microbial populations with historical healthy controls, (2) compare bacteria identified by culture vs. 16S rDNA sequencing from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) culture-, and (3) evaluate similarities in lung and oropharyngeal (OP) microbial communities in community-acquired and secondary bacterial pneumonia. Twenty BALF samples from 15 client-owned dogs diagnosed with bacterial pneumonia were enrolled. From a subset of dogs, OP swabs were collected. Extracted DNA underwent PCR of the 16S rRNA gene. Relative abundance of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were determined. The relative abundance of bacterial community members found in health was decreased in dogs with pneumonia. Taxa identified via culture were not always the dominant phylotype identified with sequencing. Dogs with community-acquired pneumonia were more likely to have overgrowth of a single organism suggesting loss of dominant species associated with health. Dogs with secondary bacterial pneumonia had a greater regional continuity between the upper and lower airways. Collectively, these data suggest that dysbiosis occurs in canine bacterial pneumonia, and culture-independent techniques may provide greater depth of understanding of the changes in bacterial community composition that occur in disease.Copyright © 2019 Vientós-Plotts, Ericsson, Rindt and Reinero.</p></html>
