A range of countries have opted to completely ban the use of antibiotics in animal feed. The animal production industries are looking for alternative ways to effectively control pathogens while providing the performance benefits previously secured by antibiotics in feed. Here, we present evidence that oregano () could be a potential alternative for pathogen control in the poultry industry. Broiler diets were supplemented with oregano powder (0%, 0.5%, 1%, and 2%) for six weeks. The capacity for pathogen control was estimated by microbiota profiling of the jejunum, ileum, and caecum content, and in the faeces, by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. The concentrations of short-chain fatty  in the caecal content were also measured, as were villus/crypt parameters in the ileum. There were no differences among treatments in  gain, feed intake, or the concentration of short-chain fatty . The height, width, and the surface area of villi in the ileum were not influenced by oregano addition. However, 1% and 2% of oregano produced a significant increase in the villus height to crypt depth ratio. There were no visible histopathological changes in the liver in control and treated groups. Although oregano had no significant effect on overall microbial diversity and gross composition, some specific genera, like ,  and , which include known pathogens, were reduced in relative abundance by oregano treatment. , recognized as a beneficial and probiotic genus, was also suppressed by the oregano treatment.© 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31667778>Elevated salivary uric  levels among adolescents with eating disorders.</a></h1><p>Uric  (UA) is increasingly recognized as having important physiological roles and associated with several peripheral and central pathophysiological outcomes, and might play a role in eating disorders (ED) pathogenesis. We investigated whether UA levels are altered among adolescents with ED.Morning salivary UA concentrations were compared between adolescents referred to treatment at the Herman Dana Center receiving a DSM-V diagnosis of an ED and matched healthy controls.Salivary UA was significantly elevated among ED compared with control values (ED mean 3.9 ± 1.2 mg/dl, control mean 2.9 ± 1.9 mg/dl, t = - 3.13 df = 81, p = 0.003).Salivary UA is elevated among adolescents with ED. Further studies are required to replicate and extend this finding and evaluate its generalizability as a state or trait marker as regards ED subtypes, other  fluids (plasma and cerebrospinal fluid), and recovery or premorbid stages, as well as its putative mechanistic relevance to ED.Level III, case-control analytic study.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31681001>Aerobic Exercise Ameliorates Myocardial Inflammation, Fibrosis and Apoptosis in High-Fat-Diet Rats by Inhibiting P2X7 Purinergic Receptors.</a></h1><p>High-fat-diet (HFD) is associated with chronic low-grade inflammation. P2X7 purinergic receptors (P2X7R) are key regulators of inflammasome activation. The benefits of exercise are partly attributed to its anti-inflammatory effect, but whether it regulates P2X7R expression to improve remodeling in cardiac myocytes treated by HFD is not completely clarified.Three groups of Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were studied: (1) control group (fed a normal chow diet), (2) HFD group, and (3) HFD+ exercise group. H9c2 myocytes were pretreated with or without A438079 (a P2X7R inhibitor) and then exposed to 200 μM palmitic  (PA) for 24 h. The levels of mRNA and protein were measured by real-time PCR and Western blot, respectively. Masson staining and hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining were used to identify remodeling of the heart. The concentration of IL-1β in serum or supernatants were measured by ELISA., collagen deposition and the number of disordered cells significantly increased in the hearts of the HFD group compared to the control group. However, exercise markedly reversed these changes in the myocardium, and the same trends were observed in the expression of MMP9, collagen I and TGF-β. Notably, the expression of P2X7R, NLRP3, caspase-1 in the hearts, and serum IL-1β level were also greatly upregulated in the heart of the HFD diet rats, and all these changes were ameliorated in the HFD + EX group. As expected, exercise also reduced the number of TUNEL-positive cells, which was consistent with the caspase-3, Bax, and Bcl-2 results. Moreover, exercise reduced  and blood lipid concentrations in the HFD diet rats. , we observed that the hallmark of fibrosis, inflammation and apoptosis in H9c2 myocytes enhanced by PA, and the P2X7R inhibitor treatment significantly reduced the expression of the NLRP3, caspase-1, suppressed the secretion of IL-1β of H9c2 cells, inhibited collagen I, TGF-β, MMP9, Bax, caspase-3 levels and increased the expression of Bcl-2, compared with the PA group. In addition, a decrease of the number of TUNEL-positive cells used by A438079 further support that cardiomyocytes apoptosis could be inhibited.Aerobic exercise reversed the cardiac remodeling via the reduction of inflammation, fibrosis and apoptosis in HFD rats, at least in part through inhibiting P2X7R expression in cardiomyocytes.Copyright © 2019 Chen, Li, Wang, Liang, Wang, Hu, Huang and Wang.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659708>Glycyrrhizic  modulates the atrazine-induced apoptosis in rabbit spleen.</a></h1><p>Atrazine (ATR) is a common herbicide used worldwide. It is a potent endocrine disruptor that causes hormonal imbalance. We investigated the modulatory role predisposed by glycyrrhizic  (GA) against the hazardous effects caused by the ATR in the rabbit spleen. Sixty rabbits were assigned into 4 groups. The first group is the negative control; the ATR group received 1/10 of the oral LD  ATR; the GA group received 50 mg/kg  daily intraproteinally; and group 4 received both ATR and GA concurrently. ATR and GA administrations were done for 60 days. ATR-induced humoral immunotoxicity was illustrated by decreased serum total protein, albumin, and globulin levels and rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus antibody titer, 4 weeks after vaccination. Moreover, upregulation of spleen Fas and caspase-III genes was recorded in ATR-exposed rabbits. Clear splenocyte apoptosis was observed in the immunohistochemical examination by the caspase-III technique. GA diminished the ATR-induced splenocyte apoptosis through downregulation of Fas and caspase-III expressions. In conclusion, our findings bounced a new perspective into the mechanism by which ATR induces immunotoxicity and assumed the potential modulatory role of GA.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31679545>Simulated amino  requirements of growing pigs differ between current factorial methods.</a></h1><p>Significant differences in the estimation of amino  requirements exist between the available factorial methods. This study aimed to compare current factorial models used to estimate the individual and population standardised ileal digestible (SID) lysine (Lys) requirements of growing pigs during a 26-day feeding phase. Individual daily feed intake and BW data from 40 high-performance pigs (25-kg initial BW) were smoothed by linear regression.  gain was constant (regression slope not different from 0) for all the pigs. The CV of the SID Lys requirements ranged from 22% at the beginning of the trial to 8% at the end. The population Brazilian tables (BT-2017) and National Research Council (NRC-2012) SID Lys requirements for the average pig were 16% higher than the average requirement estimated by the individual precision-feeding model (IPF), but similar to the estimated for the population assuming that population requirements are those of the 80th-percentile pig of the population (IPF-80). Meaning that, the IPF-80, BT-2017, and NRC-2012 models would yield similar recommendations when pigs are group-fed in conventional multi-phase systems. Additionally, the IPF-80 estimates are independent of the phase length, whereas the BT-2017 and NRC-2012 models use average population values in the middle of the feeding phase for the calculations and therefore, conventional requirement estimations decrease as the length of the feeding phase increases. In conclusion, the BT-2017 and NRC-2012 methods were calibrated for maximum population responses, which explains why these methods yield higher values than those estimated for the average pig by the IPF model. This study shows the limitations of conventional factorial methods to estimate amino  requirements for precision-feeding systems.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671870>Microbiological Insights into the Stress-Alleviating Property of an Endophytic  WR10 in Wheat under Low-Phosphorus and High-Salinity Stresses.</a></h1><p>An indole-3-acetic  producing  WR10 was previously isolated from the root of wheat (  L.). In this study, the strain WR10 was used for relieving abiotic stresses in wheat under low phosphorus and high saline in hydroponic co-culture models. Significantly, strain WR10 improved wheat seed relative germination rate under salinity stress (200/400 mM NaCl) and the root dry  in wheat seedlings under phosphorus stress (10 μM KHPO) when insoluble phosphates are available. To provide insights into its abiotic stress-alleviating properties, the strain was characterized further. WR10 grows well under different culture conditions. Particularly, WR10 resists salt (12% NaCl) and hydrolyzes both inorganic and organic insoluble phosphates. WR10 uses many plant-derived substrates as sole carbon and energy sources. It produces catalase, amylase, phosphatase, phytase, reductase, and 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) deaminase. In addition, WR10 possesses long peritrichous flagella, and its biofilm formation, as well as phytase production, is induced by abiotic stresses. Overall, the salinity-alleviating property of WR10 in wheat can be attributed to its inherent tolerance to NaCl, formation of biofilm, and production of enzymes, like catalase, amylase, and ACC deaminase. Meanwhile,  WR10 reduces low-phosphorus stress in wheat by production of phosphatases and phytases in the presence of insoluble phosphates.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668688>Metabolomics of Aerobic Exercise in Chronic Stroke Survivors: A Pilot Study.</a></h1><p>Understanding the metabolic response to exercise may aid in optimizing stroke management. Therefore, the purpose of this pilot study was to evaluate plasma metabolomic profiles in chronic stroke survivors following aerobic exercise training.Participants (age: 62 ± 1 years,  mass index: 31 ± 1 kg/m, mean ± standard error of the mean) were randomized to 6 months of treadmill exercise (N = 17) or whole- stretching (N = 8) with preintervention and postintervention measurement of aerobic capacity (VOpeak). Linear models for microarray data expression analysis was performed to determine metabolic changes over time, and Mummichog was used for pathway enrichment analysis following analysis of plasma samples by high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry.VOpeak change was greater following exercise than stretching (18.9% versus -.2%; P < .01). Pathway enrichment analysis of differentially expressed metabolites results showed significant enrichment in 4 pathways following treadmill exercise, 3 of which (heparan-, chondroitin-, keratan-sulfate degradation) involved connective tissue metabolism and the fourth involve lipid signaling (linoleate metabolism). More pathways were altered in pre and post comparisons of stretching, including branched-chain amino , tryptophan, tyrosine, and urea cycle, which could indicate loss of lean  mass.These preliminary data show different metabolic changes due to treadmill training and stretching in chronic stroke survivors and suggest that in addition to improved aerobic capacity, -bearing activity, like walking, could protect against loss of lean  mass. Future studies are needed to examine the relationship between changes in metabolomic profiles to reductions in cardiometabolic risk after treadmill rehabilitation.Published by Elsevier Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665421>Lack of association between modifiable exposures and glioma risk: A Mendelian randomisation analysis.</a></h1><p>The etiological basis of glioma is poorly understood. We have used genetic markers in a Mendelian Randomisation (MR) framework to examine if lifestyle, cardiometabolic and inflammatory factors influence the risk of glioma. This methodology reduces bias from confounding and is not affected by reverse causation.We identified genetic instruments for 37 potentially modifiable risk factors and evaluated their association with glioma risk using data from a genome-wide association study of 12,488 glioma patients and 18,169 controls. We used the estimated odds ratio of glioma associated with each of the genetically defined traits to infer evidence for a causal relationship with the following exposures: lifestyle and dietary factors (height, plasma IGF-1, blood carnitine, blood methionine, blood selenium, blood zinc, circulating adiponectin, circulating carotenoids, iron status, serum calcium, vitamin [A1, B12, B6, E and 25-hydroxyvitamin D], fatty  levels [mono-unsaturated, omega-3 and omega-6] and circulating fetuin-A); cardiometabolic factors (birth , HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, total cholesterol, total triglycerides, basal metabolic rate,  fat percentage,  mass index, fasting glucose, fasting proinsulin, HbA1C levels, diastolic and systolic blood pressure, waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio) were included; inflammatory factors (C-reactive protein (CRP), plasma IL-6 sRa and serum IgE).After correction for the testing of multiple potential risk factors and excluding associations driven by one single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) no significant association with glioma risk was observed (i.e. PCorrected > 0.05).This study did not provide evidence supporting any of the 37 factors examined as having a significant influence on glioma risk.© The Author(s) 2019.

The combination of CGA and caffeine effectively decreased  gain, intraperitoneal adipose tissue , serum LDL-c, FFA, TC, TG, leptin, IL-6 concentrations, and hepatic TG and TC levels and increased the serum adiponectin level. The CGA and caffeine combination also promoted the phosphorylation of AMPKα, inhibited the expressions of transcriptional regulators (SREBP-1c and LXRα), and decreased the expressions of FAS and HMGR. Besides, the expressions of ACO, ATGL and HSL were increased by the CGA and caffeine combinations. The results indicated that the combination of CGA and caffeine had anti-obesity effects and regulated lipid metabolism in high-fat diet-induced obese mice via the AMPKα-LXRα/SREBP-1c signaling pathway. Thus, chronic CGA and caffeine intakes may be potent for preventing obesity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663652>Effects of over-load iron on nutrient digestibility, haemato-biochemistry, rumen fermentation and bacterial communities in sheep.</a></h1><p>There is a risk of iron overload in grazing livestock. However, the effects on nutrient absorption and rumen function induced by excessive iron have not been well understood. Therefore, the purpose of present study was to investigate the impact of over-load iron on growth performance, nutrient digestibility, blood biochemistry, rumen fermentation and bacterial communities in sheep. Twenty-four German Mutton Merino cross-bred sheep with  (42.66 ± 2.34 kg BW) were randomly divided into 4 groups, each with 6 replicates and 1 sheep per replicate. The basal diet consisted of 60% Leymus chinensis hay and 40% concentrate. The sheep in 4 groups were fed the basal diets supplemented with 50 (Control), 500 (T1), 1,000 (T2) and 1,500 (T3) mg Fe/kg as ferrous sulphate monohydrate (FeSO ·H O) respectively. And the actual contents of iron in the diet were determined to be 457.68 (control), 816.42 (T1), 1,256.78 (T2) and 1,725.63 (T3) mg/kg respectively. The experiment lasted 62 days including a 7-day metabolism trial. During the whole experiment, the digestibility of dry matter, organic matter, neutral detergent fibre and  detergent fibre showed a quadratic increase with increasing over-load iron levels (p < .05), and maximum responses were found with 500 mg/kg supplementation. However, the response of total VFA concentration showed a quadratic decrease, as did the concentrations of propionate, butyrate and valerate (p < .05). Serum total iron-binding capacity on day 30 showed a quadratic decrease with the increase in high-dose iron, while the serum iron content increased linearly at day 60 (p < .05). Excessive iron resulted in the change in bacterial communities. An increase in over-load iron linearly decreased the abundance of bacteria in the phylum Bacteroidetes (p < .05), but linearly increased the Firmicutes (p = .037) and Proteobacteria (p = .018). In addition, there was a quadratic effect (p = .003) on the Fibrobacteres, which was higher in the 500 and 1,000 mg/kg Fe-supplemented groups. At the genus level, there were quadratic effects on the abundances of Selenomonas_1 (p = .023) and Ruminococcaceae_UCG-014 (p = .016). Furthermore, feeding of iron linearly increased the relative abundances of Succiniclasticum and Succinivibrionaceae_UCG-002 (p < .05). These results indicate that increasing ferrous sulphate monohydrate in diets had no negative impact on the growth performance, but it changed nutrient digestibility, blood iron parameters, rumen fermentation and bacterial communities in sheep.© 2019 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662982>Chlorogenic  Attenuates Kidney Ischemic/Reperfusion Injury via Reducing Inflammation, Tubular Injury, and Myofibroblast Formation.</a></h1><p>Kidney ischemic/reperfusion (I/R) injury is the main cause of acute kidney injury (AKI) involving renal function deterioration, renal architecture damage, and inflammation. This condition may lead to kidney fibrosis with epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and myofibroblast formation. Inhibition of chronic effects of kidney I/R injury may provide effective strategies for treating AKI and chronic kidney diseases (CKDs). Chlorogenic  (CGA) is recognized as a powerful antioxidant, with anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic properties in many conditions. However, the effect of CGA on kidney I/R injury has not been elucidated yet. Kidney I/R injury was performed on male Swiss background mice (I/R group,  = 5, 3-4 months, 30-40 g) which underwent bilateral renal pedicles clamping for 30 minutes and then were euthanized on day three after operation. Three groups of I/R were treated with 3 different doses of CGA intraperitoneally for 2 days: 3.5 (I/R + CGA1 group), 7 (I/R + CGA2 group), and 14 (I/R + CGA3 group) mg/kg of . Tubular injury was quantified based on Periodic -Schiff staining, while reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) was performed to quantify mRNA expression of TGF-1, vimentin, SOD-1, TLR-4, TNF-α, NF-κB and MCP-1. Immunohistochemical staining was done to quantify proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), myofibroblast (-SMA), SOD-1 and macrophage (CD68) number. Kidney I/R demonstrated tubular injury and increased inflammatory mediator expression, macrophage number, and myofibroblast expansion. Meanwhile, histological analysis showed lower tubular injury with higher epithelial cell proliferation in CGA-treated groups compared to the I/R group. RT-PCR also revealed significantly lower TGF-1 and vimentin mRNA expressions with higher SOD-1 mRNA expression. CGA-treated groups also demonstrated a significantly lower macrophage and myofibroblast number compared to the I/R group. These findings associated with lower mRNA expression of TLR-4, TNF-α, NF-κB, and MCP-1 as inflammatory mediators in CGA groups. I/R + CGA3 represented the highest amelioration effect among other CGA-treated groups. CGA treatment attenuates kidney I/R injury through reducing inflammation, decreasing myofibroblast expansion, and inducing epithelial cells proliferation.Copyright © 2019 Nur Arfian et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665169>Maize leaves drought-responsive genes revealed by comparative transcriptome of two cultivars during the filling stage.</a></h1><p>Like other important cereal crop in modern agricultural production, maize is also threatened by drought. And the drought stress during maize filling stage will directly affect the quality (protein or oil concentration) and also the  of grain. Therefore, different from previous studies focusing on inbred lines and pot experiment at seedling stage, current study selected filling stage of the adult plant and planting maize in the experimental field. Two hybrids cultivars with different drought tolerant were used for drought and water treatment respectively. We performed transcriptome sequencing analysis of 4 groups, 12 samples, and obtained 651.08 million raw reads. Then the data were further processed by mapping to a reference genome, GO annotation, enrichment analysis and so on. Among them we focus on the different change trends of water treatment and drought treatment, and the different responses of two drought-tolerant cultivars to drought treatment. Through the analysis, several transcripts which encode nitrogen metabolic, protein phosphorylation, MYB,AP2/ERF, HB transcriptional factor, O-glycosyl hydrolases and organic  metabolic process were implicated with maize drought stress.

Substrate enrichment with additives has been used as a strategy to increase mushroom productivity. In this study, we evaluated the impact of substrate formulation on the bioactive chemical profile of the basidiome. The bioactive chemical profile of basidiomes cultivated on rice agro-residues (RA) or sunflower seed hulls (SSH) enriched with olive oil and/or copper was evaluated using conventional colorimetric methods and FT-MIR spectrometry coupled with chemometrics. The contents of total triterpenoids, ganoderic , high-molecular- carbohydrates, and phenolic compounds were sensitive to substrate formulation and harvest time. Moreover, cluster analysis and principal component analysis of the mid-IR spectra were able to discriminate between basidiomes cultivated on either RA or SSH substrates, and for SSH substrates between enriched and nonenriched formulas. These results indicate that the bioactive composition of G. lucidum can be influenced by the formulation of the cultivation substrate.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31679568>Precise analysis of the concentrations and isotopic compositions of molybdenum and tungsten in geochemical reference materials.</a></h1><p>Molybdenum (Mo) is a redox-sensitive element and its concentrations and stable isotope compositions are widely used as a redox proxy in paleoceanography. Tungsten (W) is an emerging new isotope proxy, which has potential as a tracer for hydrothermal and early diagenetic processes. We present a new method for the precise and accurate analysis of Mo and W concentrations and isotope compositions from one single sample aliquot, thus saving mass of a sample and making the results directly comparable without concerns related to analytical or natural sample heterogeneity. After  digestion, Mo and W are separated from the sample matrix using chelating resin NOBIAS Chelate-PA1 and anion exchange resin AG1 X8. Matrix removal is highly efficient: the remaining percentage is 10 to 10% with respect to the initial . Subsequently, samples are measured for Mo and W concentrations and isotope compositions using multi-collector inductivity coupled plasma mass spectrometry (MC-ICP-MS). For mass bias correction and determination of concentrations, we use standard-sample bracketing and in addition an external correction method employing ruthenium (Ru) for Mo and rhenium (Re) for W. This double correction approach results in an external reproducibility of or below 0.10‰ (2SD) for δMo and 0.05‰ for δW based on ICP standard solutions (NIST SRM 3134 lot No. 130418 for Mo and NIST SRM 3163 lot No. 080331 for W). We present data for Mo and W in 12 geological reference materials including igneous rocks, sedimentary rocks, marine sediments, and manganese nodules. For Mo our method reproduces published values for the geological standard materials within analytical error of published values. For W, although published data do not always agree for a given geological standard material, our data agree within error with more recent data. We interpret a cause of the deviations is due to unknown effects of a desolvating nebulizer for MC-ICP-MS.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Obesity related metabolic indices including glucose tolerance, insulin resistance, serum lipid, liver function, hormones and inflammatory cytokines were assessed by standard protocols. For the monitoring of inflammatory response and lipid metabolism, transcriptional levels were profiled in liver and/or adipose tissues. Furthermore, gut microbiota composition analyses in the fecal samples were performed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and gut microbial metabolites, including lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and short-chain fatty  (SCFAs), were also tested for the assessment of the relationship between gut microbiota variation and inflammatory response.Administration with L. rhamnosus LS-8 and L. crustorum MN047 significantly mitigated  gain and insulin resistance, and inflammatory response (TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 levels in serum and corresponding mRNA levels in adipose tissues) was significantly inhibited in these two strains-treated mice. Moreover, L. rhamnosus LS-8 and L. crustorum MN047 could partially normalized mRNA expression levels involved in lipid metabolism including Pparγ, Srebp-1c, CD36, Fabp2 and FAS. In addition, these two strains manipulated gut microbiota by decreasing the abundance of Bacteroides and Desulfovibrio and increasing that of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, which in turn raised the levels of feces SCFAs and lowered the levels of circulating LPS.These results indicated that L. rhamnosus LS-8 and L. crustorum MN047 supplementation possessed the anti-obesity effect on the HFFD fed mice by alleviating inflammatory response and regulating gut microbiota, which further suggested that these two probiotics can be considered as an alternative dietary supplement in combination with the preventive and therapeutic strategies against obesity and related complications.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31667583>Effect of continuous long-term treatment for 10 years with bisphosphonate on Japanese osteoporosis patients.</a></h1><p>In terms of the balance between benefits and risks of long-term treatment with bisphosphonate, uncertainties remain regarding the optimal treatment duration. We investigated effects of continuous long-term treatment for 10 years with bisphosphonate in postmenopausal osteoporosis patients.Fifty five patients in the outpatient clinic of our hospital have been continuously treated with alendronate or risedronate for 10 years. All data were retrospectively collected. The age, height, , total muscle volume, total fat volume, and BMD at the lumbar spine, total hip and distal 1/3 radius, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), urinary type I collagen cross-linked N-telopeptide (uNTX) and tartrate-resistant  phosphatase-5b (TRAP5b), calcium (Ca) and phosphate (P) levels were measured pre- and after the start of 10-year continuous treatment.BMD at the lumbar spine increased continuously over the 10-year period, while BMD at the total hip slightly but significantly decreased, and that at the 1/3 radius did not show any significant change over the 10 years. Serum Ca value was significantly decreased after the start of treatment, and became stable within the reference range from the second year. Bone resorption markers such as uNTX and TRAP5b significantly decreased from the second year after the start of treatment and no significant changes were observed thereafter. There were no serious medical adverse events including atypical femoral fractures and osteonecrosis of the jaw.We believe that the continuous use of alendronate and risedronate for 10 years could be an option for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis patients.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668855>Expression and purification of an immunogenic SUMO-OmpC fusion protein of Salmonella Typhimurium in Escherichia coli.</a></h1><p>Salmonella is found to be a major causes of food borne diseases globally. Poultry products contaminated with this pathogen is one of the major sources of infections in humans. Outer membrane protein C (OmpC) of Salmonella Typhimurium is a promising DNA vaccine candidate to mitigate Salmonella infection in poultry. However, the large-scale production of bioactive recombinant OmpC (rOmpC) protein is hindered due to the formation of inclusion bodies in Escherichia coli. The objective of this work was to attain high level expression of rOmpC protein, purify and evaluate its functional properties. The ompC gene was optimized and fused with small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) gene for high level expression as soluble protein. The fusion protein with ~58 kDa molecular  was observed on SDS-PAGE gel. The expression levels of rOmpC fusion protein reached maximum of 38% of total soluble protein (TSP) after 8 h of 0.2% rhamnose induction. Protein purification was carried out using nickel nitrilotriacetic  (Ni-NTA) purification column. Western blot were performed to analyse expression and immunoreactivity of rOmpC fusion protein. The results indicate that SUMO fusion system is ideal for large scale production of functional rOmpC fusion protein expression in E. coli.Copyright © 2019.

Despite the critical role of the taste system in determining food selection and consumption, the effects of chronic sucrose consumption on the peripheral taste system in mammals have received limited attention. We offered female Sprague Dawley rats free access to water and one of three diets for up to 40 days: (1) sucrose-free chow or "NS" diet; (2) a high-sucrose dry diet or "HS"; or (3) 30% sucrose solution and the NS diet, designated "LiqS" diet. Sucrose consumption by LiqS rats gradually increased and by day 14 was equal to that of HS rats. Food intake decreased in LiqS rats, but their energy intake remained higher than for NS or HS rats. There was no significant difference in  gain of the groups during the study. Recordings from the chorda tympani nerve (CT), which innervates taste buds on the anterior tongue, revealed decreased responses to 1 M sucrose in both LiqS and HS rats and to acesulfame K and salt tastants in LiqS rats after 40 days on diet. Umami, bitter, and  response magnitudes were unchanged in both groups. These results demonstrate that chronic sucrose exposure inhibits taste responses to higher concentrations of sweet stimuli. More surprisingly, CT responses to NaCl and 0.5M NaAc were significantly reduced in rats on the LiqS diet. Thus, the physical form of the diet influences taste responsiveness to salt and sweet taste function.

The N-terminal sequence of 15 amino  of EuRP-61 supported the conclusion that the enzyme was a serine protease because its amino  sequence had homology (between 50-70% identities) with the subtilisin-like proteases of other plants. EuRP-61 had a molecular  estimated at 61 kDa analyzed by MALDI-TOF MS. The enzyme could cleave human fibrinogen with optimal conditions at pH 5.0 and 45 °C. The enzyme had a broad range of pH stability from 1-14 and tolerance to denaturation up to a temperature of approximately 65-66 °C. EuRP-61 hydrolyzed fibrinogen with a Michaelis constant (K) of 4.95 ± 0.1 μM; a maximal velocity (V) of 578.1 ± 11.81 ng.min; and a catalytic efficiency (V/K) of 116.8 ± 1 ng.μM.min. EuRP-61was crystallized under the condition of sodium iodide (0.2 M), Bis-Tris propane (0.1 M, pH 8.5) and PEG3350 (20%) by the sitting-drop method. The crystal belonged to space group P222, with unit cell dimension a = 109.91, b = 67.38 and c = 199.45 Å and diffracted X-ray to 2.53 Å resolution. The crystal structure of EuRP-61 will be explored further by special phase solving techniques.Copyright © 2019.

In turn, dietary fatty  can enhance resistance under cold stress. The present study reports the nutritional effect on suboptimal temperature tolerance based on histopathological alterations in tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus). Fish (initial : 34.02 ± 0.79) were exposed to two different temperatures (20 °C and 30 °C) for 30 days. Under both conditions, fish were fed two different diets based on the linoleic/α-linolenic ratio (n6/n3 = 12.02 and n6/n3 = 3.85). The most important alterations in liver caused by temperature included high cellular hyperplasia in fish at 30 °C (P < 0.05). Suboptimal temperature also caused gills aneurysm, lamellar lifting and low hyperplasia (P < 0.05). Cytoplasmic vacuolization decreased and nuclear displacement increased in the fish fed n6/n3 = 3.85 (P < 0.05). Suboptimal temperature provided high gills aneurysm, epithelial lamellae lifting and low lamellar hyperplasia (P < 0.05). Conversely, the fatty  content (n6/n3 = 3.85) in the diet provided low lamellar lifting and fusions (P < 0.05). Finally, tilapia showed an increased glycogen storage trend in gills and muscle at low temperature (P < 0.05). Our study suggests that when feeding tilapia a high dietary n3 content, this fish is able to respond to suboptimal temperature in subtropical aquaculture facilities.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

To date, there is little information about the metabolite profile of rice under Fe toxicity conditions. In fact, metabolite has a contribution to the physiological condition of plants. Plant metabolomics is a study of low-molecular  metabolites in plants under certain conditions. The objective of the research was to investigate physiological and metabolic changes in rice under Fe toxicity stress. Two-week-old seedlings of four rice varieties with various Fe toxicity tolerance levels were stressed hydroponically with 400 ppm FeSO7HO for 10 d. Numerous physiological characters were observed and untargeted metabolomic analysis was carried out using gas chromatography-mass spectrophotometry (GC-MS). The results showed Fe toxicity induced physiological and metabolite variation in rice. By comparing the metabolites synthesized in Fe toxicity-stressed plants with control plants, it showed that elaidic , linoleic , and linolenic  could be as metabolite marker candidates for rice response to Fe toxicity stress. When plants exposed to Fe toxicity stress, elaidic  increased, whereas linoleic- and linolenic  decreased. The alteration of fatty  composition in the root and shoot suggests the alteration of metabolites is one of the tolerance strategies of rice to Fe toxicity stress. This finding offers an insight about the tolerance strategies of rice under Fe toxicity stress related to the maintenance process of the cell membranes during this stress. The genes underlying biosynthesis of the fatty  could be a target of future research on responsible genes for Fe toxicity tolerance in rice.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31679027>Dietary supplementation with free methionine or methionine dipeptide improves environment intestinal of broilers challenged with Eimeria spp.</a></h1><p>This study examined the influence of a diet enriched with free methionine (dl-Met) or methionine dipeptide (dl-MMet) on the intestinal health of Eimeria-challenged (EC) and unchallenged (UC) broilers. A non-supplemented, methionine-deficient diet (NS) was used as control. Treatments were arranged in a 2 × 3 factorial completely randomized design with eight replications. Broilers in the EC group were infected with sporulated oocysts of Eimeria spp. (E. acervulina, E. maxima, E. praecox, and E. mitis) at 14 days of age. Performance analysis, light and electron microscopy of the jejunum, analysis of genes related to apoptosis and cell proliferation in the jejunum, and blood tests were performed at 6 days post-inoculation (dpi). EC broilers had poorer performance than UC broilers, regardless of diet (P < 0.001). Broilers fed the dl-Met diet had greater  gain (P = 0.004) and lower feed conversion ratio (P = 0.019) than broilers fed other diets. Jejunal sections from EC broilers fed the NS diet showed short (P = 0.001) and wide villi (P < 0.001) with increased crypt depth (P < 0.001) and reduced villus / crypt ratio (P = 0.001), jejunal absorptive surface area (P < 0.001), number of neutral goblet cells (Eimeria challenge: P = 0.048; diet P = 0.016), and mucin 2 (MUC2) gene expression (P = 0.018). EC birds fed the dl-MMet diet had higher enterocyte height (P < 0.001). Birds fed the dl-MMet diet had low lamina propria width (P = 0.009). UC broilers fed the dl-Met diet had the highest number of acidic goblet cells (P = 0.005), whereas EC broilers assigned the dl-MMet diet showed the highest number of intraepithelial lymphocytes (P = 0.033). Reduced expression of caspase-3 (CASP3) (P = 0.005), B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2) (P < 0.001), mechanistic target of rapamycin (MTOR) (P < 0.001), and ribosomal protein S6 kinase B1 (RPS6KB1) (P < 0.001) genes was observed in EC animals. MTOR expression levels were highest in birds fed the dl-MMet diet (P = 0.004). Plasma activities of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) was influenced by both diet (P = 0.002) and Eimeria challenge (P = 0.005), with EC broilers assigned the NS diet showing the highest levels. EC broilers fed the NS diet had higher creatine kinase (CK) activity (P = 0.049). EC broilers had lower plasma uric  (P = 0.004) and higher serum mucoproteins level (P < 0.001). These results indicate that methionine dipeptide supplementation is able to mitigate the harmful intestinal effects of Eimeria spp. in broilers.© The Author(s) 2019.

Thus, based on the different opinions on the efficaciousness of morbid obesity treatments, the aim of the present study was to estimate the association of serum ghrelin and Met-enkephalins (native, five amino  and cryptic, precursor of enkephalin) concentrations with BMI value in bariatric patients within 30 postoperative days.Study were performed on 38 female patients divided into two groups: I.BMI lower than 40 kg/m2 (n=18) and II. BMI higher than 40 kg/m2 (n=20). Blood was taken before (-24h), 72 h and 30 days after the sleeve gastrectomy. Routine hematologic, anthropometric and metabolic parameters as well as TSH, ghrelin and Met-enkephalins values were measured in all patients.There were statistically significant differences between two groups before the surgery in terms of TSH, both forms of Met-enkephalin, triglycerides concentrations, activity of ALT, GGTP and CRP. After 72 h, the serum levels of cryptic Met-enkephalin, CRP and activity of enzymes varied between the two groups of patients. Thirty days after the surgery, some metabolic and immune parameters were still different in both female groups in favour of patients with lover BMI. However, significant differences were noticed in the levels of ghrelin (increase), native (decrease) and cryptic Met-enkephalins (increase).The activity of endogenous peptides in bariatric patients is connected with the obesity degree. Ghrelin level increases are negatively correlated with native Met-enkephalin changes shortly after bariatric surgery. The interplay of ghrelin and opioids might be consider as a predictor of postoperative  loss success.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671233>Effects of acute heat stress on intestinal microbiota in grow-finishing pigs, and associations with feed intake and serum profile.</a></h1><p>This study was conducted to assess the effects of acute heat stress (HS) on intestinal microbiota, and the associations with the changes in feed intake (FI) and serum profile.Twenty four individually housed pigs (Duroc × Large White × Landrace, 30 ± 1 kg ) were randomly assigned to receive 1 of 3 treatments (8 pigs / treatment): 1) thermal neutral (TN) conditions (25 ± 1°C), 2) HS conditions (35 ± 1°C), 3) pair-feeding (PF) with HS under TN conditions. After 24-h treatment, pigs were monitored to assess feed intake (FI), and samples of serum and feces were collected to investigate serum profile, microbial composition, and short chain fatty  (SCFAs). The results showed that HS decreased (P < 0.05) FI compared with the TN group. Compared with TN group, HS changed serum profile by affecting biochemical parameters and hormones related with energy metabolism and stress response; immune indicators were also altered in HS group. Most of changes in serum profile were independent of FI reduction. Additionally, HS shifted the diversity and composition of fecal microbial community by increasing (P < 0.05) Proteobacteria and decreasing (P < 0.05) Bacteroidetes. Moreover, HS decreased (P < 0.05) the concentrations of propionate, butyrate, valerate, iso-valerate, and total SCFAs in feces with a FI-independent manner. Furthermore, the Spearman correlation analysis implied that changes of serum profile have potential correlation with alterations of fecal microbiota and their metabolites SCFAs in acute HS-treated grow-finishing pigs.Metabolism disorders caused by 24-h acute HS associated with changes of fecal microbiota and their metabolites SCFAs with a FI-independent manner in grow-finishing pigs.These results give us a new insight of the intestinal damage caused by acute HS and the underlying mechanisms.© 2019 The Society for Applied Microbiology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666411>[The fenofibrate effect on genotoxicity in brain and liver and on the expression of genes regulating fatty  metabolism of mice].</a></h1><p>Fibrates are well-known agonists of the PPAR family (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors). This class of drugs is used for the treatment of dyslipidemia and atherosclerosis. Fenofibrate is one of the members of this class of synthetic PPARα receptor ligands. The oral administration of 0.3% fenofibrate caused a decrease in strength due to loss of  in laboratory animals when improving behavioural features. Analysis of the mitochondrial DNA of liver cells showed a genotoxic effect of fenofibrate, due to accumulation of reactive oxygen species, which could be attributed to activation of peroxisomal β-oxidation processes, as well as to the lack of increase in the expression of genes encoding antioxidant defense proteins. Treatment with fenofibrate did not cause brain mtDNA damage. It has been shown that fenofibrate induced mitochondrial β-oxidation in the brain, as indicated by the increased expression of the Acadm and Cpt1a and Ppargc1a and Ppara. The study found no effect of fenofibrate on the increase of mitochondrial biogenesis in brain and liver cells. Thus, we can conclude that fenofibrate significantly affects lipid metabolism in the liver and brain, but in the liver it is associated with an increase of oxidative stress, resulting in mtDNA oxidative damage. However, fenofibrate-induced increase in the expression of Ppargc1a is not associated with an increase of mitochondrial biogenesis. This is consistent with the recent suggestion that PGC-1α might not be a master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31676428>Growth performance, haematological changes, immune response, antioxidant activity and disease resistance in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) fed diet supplemented with ellagic .</a></h1><p>The present study was performed to investigate the effects of various levels of dietary ellagic  (EA) on growth performance, haematological values, immune response, protection against Yersinia ruckeri infection, and oxidant/antioxidant status in rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss. Fish were fed with the control diet and three different experimental diets containing three graded levels of EA (50, 100 and 200 mg kg diet) for 8 weeks. At the end of the experiment, the growth performance [ gain (WG), specific growth rate (SGR) and feed conversion ratio (FCR)], haematological values [the red blood cell (RBC) count, haemoglobin (Hb) concentration, haematocrit (Ht) level and erythrocyte indices: mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular haemoglobin (MCH) and mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration (MCHC)], immune response [white blood cell (WBC) count, oxidative radical production (nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) assay), phagocytic activity (PA) and phagocytic index (PI), total protein (TP) and immunoglobulin M (IgM) levels, serum bactericidal activity (BA), lysozyme (LYZ) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activities] and oxidant/antioxidant status [tissue malondialdehyde (MDA) levels and superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activities] were analysed. In addition, fish were challenged by Y. ruckeri and survival rate was recorded for 14 days. In the groups fed with EA the growth parameters such as WG, SGR, and FCR did not vary significantly. The RBC count, Hb concentration, and Ht level increased in the groups fed with EA when compared with the control group. However, there were no significant differences in the MCV, MCH and MCHC values among the groups. The results demonstrated enhancement in all the immunological parameters in the groups fed with EA compared to the control group. The results obtained from challenge with Y. ruckeri revealed reduction in the mortalities in the groups fed with EA. The dietary EA stimulated the SOD, CAT and GSH-Px activities in liver, head kidney and spleen as compared to the control group; however, a reverse trend was observed in the MDA levels of tissues. The present study suggest that EA can effectively enhance the haematological values, immune response, antioxidant capacity, and disease resistance in rainbow trout.Copyright © 2019.

This may result from altered energy metabolism or dietary habits.We hypothesized that a lower intake of BCAAs improves tissue-specific insulin sensitivity.This randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, crossover trial examined well-controlled T2D patients receiving isocaloric diets (protein: 1 g/kg ) for 4 wk. Protein requirements were covered by commercially available food supplemented ≤60% by an AA mixture either containing all AAs or lacking BCAAs. The dietary intervention ensured sufficient BCAA supply above the recommended minimum daily intake. The patients underwent the mixed meal tolerance test (MMT), hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps (HECs), and skeletal muscle and white adipose tissue biopsies to assess insulin signaling.After the BCAA- diet, BCAAs were reduced by 17% during fasting (P < 0.001), by 13% during HEC (P < 0.01), and by 62% during the MMT (P < 0.001). Under clamp conditions, whole- and hepatic insulin sensitivity did not differ between diets. After the BCAA- diet, however, the oral glucose sensitivity index was 24% (P < 0.01) and circulating fibroblast-growth factor 21 was 21% higher (P < 0.05), whereas meal-derived insulin secretion was 28% lower (P < 0.05). Adipose tissue expression of the mechanistic target of rapamycin was 13% lower, whereas the mitochondrial respiratory control ratio was 1.7-fold higher (both P < 0.05). The fecal microbiome was enriched in Bacteroidetes but depleted of Firmicutes.Short-term dietary reduction of BCAAs decreases postprandial insulin secretion and improves white adipose tissue metabolism and gut microbiome composition.

Zhangjiakou and Beijing will jointly host the Winter Olympic Games in 2022, which will likely increase local PFASs pollution and their associated risks over the coming period. In this study, we identified ecological process of PFASs, including sources, environmental fate, and risks, from the Yongding Watershed to the Guanting Reservoir. The concentrations of total 12 PFASs in water of the Guanting Reservoir were higher than that from the Yongding Watershed, with mean of 48.9 and 33.7 ng/L, respectively. The concentrations of PFASs in sediment of the Yongding Watershed and the Guanting Reservoir were similar, with mean of 1.01 and 0.827 ng/g dry , respectively. Detected levels of PFASs in the Guanting Reservoir significantly increased during the past eight years, possibly due to an improving economy and a rapidly developed service industry. Moderate PFASs levels in fish of the Guanting Reservoir were detected relative to other lakes and reservoirs. The daily intake of PFASs via fish and water ranged from 4.96 to 15.0 ng/kg bw/day, with higher levels found in children relative to adults. In total, approximately 9.06 kg of PFASs from riverine flow and atmospheric deposition annually entered the Guanting Reservoir. PFASs from the Yongding River significantly contributed to the pollution of Guanting Reservoir, with predominance of perfluorobutanoic  (PFBA) in water, and long-chain perfluorinated carboxylic  (PFCAs) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) in sediment in both the Yongding Watershed and the Guanting Reservoir. Most of the PFASs (23.5 kg) were stored in water of the Guanting Reservoir, while the annual storage of PFASs in sediment and fish was only 4.68 × 10 kg and 4.36 × 10 kg via deposition and accumulation, respectively. The results suggest that water quality management of the Yongding Watershed is necessary for effective control on PFASs pollution in the Guanting Reservoir.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

In this study, wheat bran protein isolate was digested with alcalase to produce wheat bran protein hydrolysate (WPH) that was then separated into different peptide fractions (<1, 1-3, 3-5, and 5-10 kDa) by membrane ultrafiltration. WPH and the peptide fractions were evaluated for in vitro activities such as antioxidant, renin inhibition, and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition. In addition, the blood pressure-lowering effects of WPH and the <1 kDa peptides were determined by oral administration to spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). Results showed that the ACE and renin inhibitions were significantly (p < .05) higher for the <1 kDa fraction (84.25% ± 2.45%, 75.19% ± 1.75%, respectively) when compared to the WPH and >1 kDa fractions. The <1 kDa fraction also showed significantly (p < .05) higher oxygen radical antioxidant activity with 2044.73 ± 37.45 (μM TE/g protein) when compared to lower values obtained for the >1 kDa membrane fractions and WPH. Oral administration (100 mg/kg ) of the <1 kDa membrane fraction to SHRs resulted in a better decrease (-35 mmHg) in the systolic blood pressure when compared to the WPH (-20 mmHg) after 6 hr. And seven peptides (NL, QL, FL, HAL, AAVL, AKTVF, and TPLTR) were identified and amino  sequence was determined by tandem mass spectrometry. We conclude that the WPH could be considered as a suitable natural antihypertensive and antioxidant resource. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: The results of the present study indicate that WPH and its ultrafiltration fractions possess potential as a source of antihypertensive and strong antioxidant peptides. It has been proved that wheat bran has a good blood pressure lowering and antioxidation and other biological activities, and the <1 kDa fraction showing high oxygen radical absorbance capacity level also has better in vitro ACE inhibition and renin-inhibitory activity. The higher antihypertensive efficiency of the <1 kDa fraction may be because the peptides can be better absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract or an increased ability to interact with the enzyme (ACE or renin) protein structure to change the active conformation and lead to decreased catalysis. The results of this study indicate that WPH, especially <1 kDa peptide, can be used as a component in formulating antihypertensive functional foods and nutraceuticals, thus improving the industrial production efficiency and bioavailability of wheat bran.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31682409>Inhibition of Mitochondrial Fatty  Oxidation Contributes to Development of Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease Induced by Environmental Cadmium Exposure.</a></h1><p>Cadmium (Cd) is one of the most prevalent toxic metal pollutants widely distributed in water and soil environments. Epidemiological studies have shown that exposure to Cd is implicated in the prevalence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in middle-aged human population, but biological evidence is lack and its toxicological mechanism remains unclear for the disease predisposition from environmental Cd exposure. In this study, we established a chronic Cd-exposure mouse model mimicking the liver Cd deposition in middle-aged human population to determine whether the environmental Cd exposure can induce NAFLD. Results showed that hepatic Cd burden at levels of 0.95 and 6.04 μg/g wet  resulting from 20-week Cd exposure at different doses induced NAFLD and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)-like phenotypes in mice, respectively. The Cd exposure caused marked hepatic mitochondrial dysfunction and fatty  oxidation deficiency, along with significant suppression of sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) signaling pathway in the liver. In vitro study confirmed that Cd evidently inhibited mitochondrial fatty  oxidation in hepatocytes and that SIRT1 signaling was potentially involved in the process. Our findings suggest that exposure to environmental Cd is a tangible risk factor for NAFLD, and the induced public health risks deserve greater concerns.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673792>Protective effect of taurine against doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity in rats: echocardiographical and histological findings.</a></h1><p>Doxorubicin (DOXO) may cause serious cardiotoxic effects that limit its use as an antineoplastic agent. We aimed to evaluate the protective role of taurine (TAU), a beta amino  with antioxidant activity, against DOXO-induced cardiotoxicity in a rat model. Thirty-one male Sprague-Dawley rats (300-400 g) were randomized into four groups: control (n = 7, intraperitoneal [ip] saline for 14 days), TAU (n = 8, 150 mg/kg  TAU ip for 14 days), DOXO (n = 8, 25 mg/kg  DOXO ip on 12th, 13th, and 14th days), and DOXO + TAU (n = 8, TAU for 14 days and DOXO on 12th, 13th, and 14th days). The left ventricular functions were evaluated on 15th day by echocardiography. The heart tissues were then excised for histological evaluation. In DOXO group, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), fractional shortening (FS), and mitral lateral annulus (s') velocity were significantly lower, and the left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic diameters (LVEDD, LVESD) were significantly higher than control group (p < 0.05), indicating a significant deterioration in left ventricular functions. However, in comparison to DOXO group, LVESD, LVEDD, LVEF, FS, and s' were significantly improved in DOXO + TAU group (p < 0.05). On histological evaluation, contrary to the normal cellular structure of cardiomyocytes in control and TAU groups, DOXO group showed increased nuclear or cytoplasmic changes and infiltrative cell proliferation (p < 0.001), which were remarkably reduced in DOXO + TAU group (p < 0.001). TAU treatment has a protective effect against DOXO-induced cardiotoxicity on echocardiographical and histological evaluation. For common use of TAU to prevent DOXO-induced cardiotoxicity, our findings should be confirmed by clinical studies.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663032>Molecular characterization of the  receptor in  larvae.</a></h1><p>Larval therapy with  is a promising strategy in wound healing.

Notch blockage inhibits Th17 cells response that are involved in the development of acute lung injury (ALI). This study investigated the protective effects of tangeretin on LPS-induced ALI in mice. Male C57BL/6 mice were treated with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), lipopolysaccharide (LPS), LPS and tangeretin, or LPS and N-[N-(3,5-difluorophenacetyl)-l-alanyl]-S-phenylglycine t-butyl ester (DAPT, a Notch signaling inhibitor), which were harvested at 48 h after challenged by LPS. CD4 T cells were treated with tangeretin or DAPT and harvested after 72 h. Tangeretin notably attenuated pathological changes and decreased the wet to dry  ratio of the mouse lungs. The total cell and neutrophil counts, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), myeloperoxidase activity of lung tissue were markedly reduced by tangeretin. The percentage of CD4+IL-17 + T cells in the lungs and the concentration of interleukin (IL)-17 and IL-22 in BALF were significantly down-regulated by tangeretin. As with the positive control (DAPT), tangeretin inhibited the activity of the Notch signaling pathway accompanied with the down-regulation of -related orphan receptor gamma t and IL-23 receptor expression. This study demonstrated that tangeretin protects against LPS-induced ALI by suppressing Th17 response at least partially, through a Notch-dependent mechanism.Copyright © 2019.

Gestational exposure to perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) can negatively affect birth size and disrupt maternal and neonatal thyroid function, although the interrelationship is unclear.We aimed to quantify the associations between maternal serum-PFAS concentrations and birth , birth length, and cranial circumference. We also aimed to estimate associations between PFAS and thyroid hormone (TH) concentrations, thereby elucidating whether THs potentially mediate the associations between PFAS concentrations and birth size.We studied a population-based prospective cohort of 172 mother-singleton pairs from the Faroe Islands. Twelve PFAS were measured in maternal serum obtained at 34 weeks of gestation. THs were measured in maternal and cord serum. Associations between PFAS concentrations and birth size and TH concentrations were estimated using multivariable linear regressions. Sex-stratified analyses along with a mediation analysis were performed to estimate potential mediating effects of THs in the association between PFAS and birth outcomes.Several PFASs were negatively associated with birth , length, and head circumference, and a general positive association between maternal serum-PFASs and cord serum-thyroid stimulating hormone was found. For instance, a doubling in perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic  (PFOA) was associated with a 53% (95% CI: 18%, 99%) and 40% (95% CI: 8%, 81%) increases in thyroid stimulating hormone concentrations, respectively. There was little evidence of sexually dimorphic associations.

Here, an inexpensive and multifunctional Cu(II)-based water-dispersible humic  (Cu-WH) fungicide with growth-promoting ability was developed with a simple method. A 3 D molybdate carbon hierarchical nanosphere (MoO2-C-HN) catalyst was successfully synthesized using a green route and applied in a solid-phase activation of lignite to obtain water-dispersible humic . Cu(II)-based water-dispersible humic  (Cu-WH) was then formed through a simple reaction of Cu(II) and the humic . The resultant Cu-WH showed strong antifungal performance against Rhizoctonia solani in laboratory incubation experiments. After being treated with Cu3-WH (0.1 mg L-1), the control efficiency of rice sheath blight at 1, 3, and 5 days after infection was 90.54%, 78.96%, 66.31%, respectively. It also enhanced the water-holding capacity of substrate and thus effectively improved the growth of rice seedlings. In comparison to commercial rice seedling substrate, the substrate treated with 8 wt% of Cu3-WH increased plant height, stem diameter, fresh  and chlorophyll content by 19.23%, 35.91%,14.52%, and 42.85%, respectively. The newly developed Cu-WH thus can be used as a novel low-cost efficient fungicide and growth stimulator to treat rice sheath blight as well as to increase rice production.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659553>Purification, characterization, and structural elucidation of serralysin-like alkaline metalloprotease from a novel source.</a></h1><p>Serratiopeptidase is an alkaline metalloendopeptidase, which acquired wide significance because of its therapeutic applications. The present study was undertaken for purification, characterization, and structural elucidation of serratiopeptidase produced from Streptomyces hydrogenans var. MGS13.The crude enzyme was purified by precipitating with ammonium sulfate, dialysis, and Sephadex gel filtration, resulting in 34% recovery with a 12% purification fold. The purified enzyme S.AMP13 was spotted as a single clear hydrolytic band on casein zymogram and whose molecular  was found to be 32 kDa by SDS-PAGE. The inhibitor and stability studies revealed that this enzyme is metalloprotease, thermostable, and alkaline in nature. The maximum serratiopeptidase activity was observed at 37 °C and pH 9.0. The partial amino  sequence of the purified enzyme S.AMP13 by LC-MS/MS analysis shows the closest sequence similarities with previously reported alkaline metalloendopeptidases. The amino  sequence alignment of S.AMP13 shared a conserved C-terminus region with peptidase-M10 serralysin superfamily at amino  positions 128-147, i.e., ANLSTRATDTVYGFNSTAGR revealed that this enzyme is a serralysin-like protease. The kinetic studies of the purified enzyme revealed a K of 1 mg/mL for its substrate casein and V of 319 U/mL/min. The 3D structure of the purified enzyme was modeled by using SWISS-MODEL, and the quality of the structure was authenticated by assessing the Ramachandran plot using PROCHECK server, which suggested that the enzyme was stable with good quality.Inhibitor, stability, electrophoretic, and bioinformatic studies suggested that the purified enzyme obtained from S. hydrogenans var.

C57BL/6 type 8 week-old male mice (n = 10/per group) were fed with standard chow or three isocaloric diets consisting fructose, monounsaturated fatty  (MUFA), or saturated fatty  (SFA) for 15 weeks. After the dietary manipulation, the mice were sacrificed, tissues and blood were collected. Consequently,  gains, liver , and plasma homeostasis model of assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) values in were at higher levels in SFA and fructose groups (p < 0.05). The plasma concentrations of the non-esterified fatty  (NEFA), triglyceride (TG), and liver steatosis were found to be at higher levels in SFA and fructose groups (p < 0.05). Moreover, the expression levels of acetyl-CoA carboxylase-1 (ACC1), insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS1), AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4) in the liver were affected by the intake of SFA and fructose. Furthermore, the plasma levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP1) and the thiobarbituric  reactive substances (TBARS) in the liver were elevated in SFA and fructose group (p < 0.05). The plasma level of anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-10 (IL -10) was found to be lower in the SFA group compared to the other groups (p < 0.05). In conclusion, the inflammation and oxidation are related with the fatty - and fructose-induced impaired insulin signaling and fat accumulation in liver. Hence, in order to decrease the oxidative stress and pro-inflammatory response, it is substantial to reduce the saturated fat and added sugar or to replace with the unsaturated fat and complex carbohydrates in diet.Copyright © 2019.

Despite being well studied as a toxic element, the effects of Al on date palm have not been investigated. This study aimed to assess the toxic effects of different Al concentrations on the development and growth of date palm callus and evaluate the biochemical and molecular response of date palm cells under Al stress.Our study revealed the phytotoxicity of Al concentrations (50, 100, 150 and 200 mg.l) on date palm callus. The fresh and dry  and the number of produced embryos were significantly decreased in response to Al concentration. At 150 mg.l, the embryo number decreased to 1.66 compared with the 19.33 in the control treatment. At high Al concentration (200 mg.l), the callus failed to produce any embryo. Biochemical analysis revealed that Al exposure had negative effect on callus. Total soluble carbohydrates, total soluble protein and free amino  were decreased in plants receiving 200 mg.l Al treatment compared with those in the untreated ones. A similar decline was observed in total soluble protein and free amino  in response to Al treatment. Significant accumulations of malondialdehyde, HO and peroxidase activity accompanied the increase in Al concentration in cultured tissues, revealing the generation of toxic reactive oxygen species in affected cultures. The genotoxic effect of Al at high concentrations (150 and 200 mg.l) was revealed by protein patterns.Our findings revealed for the first time the phytotoxicity of Al to date palm callus. At 200 mg.l, Al prevented the embryo production of date palm callus. At 50, 100, 150 and 200 mg.l, Al negatively affected the biochemical characteristics of date palm callus. At 150 and 200 mg.l, Al induced changes in protein expression. These data showed that the tissue culture technique can be used as a valuable approach in heavy metal toxicity studies.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670129>Purification, characterization, and functional properties of a novel glycoprotein from tartary buckwheat (Fagopyrum tartaricum) seed.</a></h1><p>A pure glycoprotein (BGP4-I) was obtained from tartary buckwheat seeds by aqueous extraction followed by DEAE-Sepharose Fast Flow ion exchange chromatography and Sephadex G-100 gel filtration chromatography. The average molecular  of BGP4-I, as determined by high performance gel permeation chromatography, was 123.43 kDa. The structure of BGP4-I was characterized based on Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, circular dichroism spectroscopy, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, etc. Based on the nano-liquid chromatography-coupled electrospray ionization mass spectrometry analysis of the amino  sequence of BGP4-I, belongs unequivocally to the glycosyl hydrolase family 1 in the Carbohydrate Active Enzymes database by alignment studies. The specific activity of BGP4-I was 18.44 μmol/min/mg on the substrate p-nitrophenyl-β-d-glucopyranoside. Furthermore, BGP4-I is unique in its specificity for some substrates. These results suggest that the BGP4-I from tartary buckwheat seeds is a novel specific β-glucosidase setting the foundation for potential applications in the food industry.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The physiological basis of molybdenum phytotoxicity is poorly understood. Plants take up molybdenum as molybdate, which is a structural analogue of sulfate. Therefore, it is presumed that elevated molybdate concentrations may hamper the uptake and subsequent metabolism of sulfate, which may induce sulfur deficiency. In the current research, Chinese cabbage (Brassica pekinensis) seedlings were exposed to 50, 100, 150 and 200 μM Na MoO for nine days. Leaf chlorosis and a decreased plant growth occurred at concentrations ≥ 100 μM. Root growth was more affected than shoot growth. At ≥ 100 μM Na MoO , the sulfate uptake rate and capacity were increased, though only when expressed on a root fresh  basis. When expressed on a whole plant fresh  basis, which corrects for the impact of molybdate on the shoot-to-root ratio, the sulfate uptake rate and capacity remained unaffected. Molybdate concentrations ≥ 100 μM altered the mineral nutrient composition of plant tissues, although the levels of sulfur metabolites (sulfate, water-soluble non-protein thiols and total sulfur) were not altered. Moreover, the levels of nitrogen metabolites (nitrate, amino , proteins and total nitrogen), which are generally strongly affected by sulfate deprivation, were not affected. The root water-soluble non-protein thiol content was increased and the tissue nitrate levels decreased, only at 200 μM Na MoO . Evidently, molybdenum toxicity in Chinese cabbage was not due to the direct interference of molybdate with the uptake and subsequent metabolism of sulfate.© 2019 German Society for Plant Sciences and The Royal Botanical Society of the Netherlands.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31675673>Antidepressant and antinociceptive activities in animal models and in vitro assessment of the anti-thyroid activity of bis(DL-pyroglutamate)magnesium complex.</a></h1><p>Magnesium is an essential element related with biochemistry of the brain and different types of depression have been associated with its deficiency.The structure of a novel magnesium bis(DL-pyroglutamate) (Mg(DL-pGlu)) was elucidated by X-ray crystallography. Wistar rats were used in the in vivo experiments. The antidepressant-like effect was assessed by the forced swim test (FST) and the antinociceptive activity was evaluated using hot plate test. In both, non-specific effects were evaluated by the open field test. Anti-thyroid activity was examined using Lang's method. Albumin binding behavior was evaluated by 3D fluorescence spectroscopy.For the Mg(DL-pGlu) complex (30 mg/kg), the FST test on Wistar rats revealed a decrease of 22% in the immobility time and an increment of 106% in the swimming time. The compound alters neither the locomotor activity nor the  after chronic administration. At the same dose, it showed antinociceptive activity, increasing the response latency. It blocks iodination reactions generating a charge transfer complex with iodine hence indicating anti-thyroid activity (K = 45366.5 ± 29 M). Albumin 3D fluorescence spectroscopy experiments showed intensity increase of peak A and decrease of peak B.The results showed that the new compound produced a lowering of the immobility time and an increment of the swimming ability of the rats. The compound is able to increase the response latency in 70.0%, to capture iodine (anti-thyroid activity) and to interact with albumin through covalent type of interaction of the free NH groups.Copyright © 2019 Institute of Pharmacology, Polish Academy of Sciences.

Deep mine biofilm samples that contain high amounts of mucoid exopolysaccharide often pose difficulties to obtaining refined community DNA. To circumvent this hindrance, we report our own developed "MINES" method for optimal biofilm DNA recovery suitable for all types of high-resolution downstream applications. The method is also suitable for samples collected from landfill compost, kitchen digest (KD), and for Gram-positive Geobacillus sp. strain WSUCF1 and Gram-negative E. coli DH5α strains. In one form of the method, use of a gentle preprocessing technique to loosen the mucoid layer, combined with a multi-lytic polyzyme treatment to maximize yields from all cell types in the biofilm sample, yielded 1 μg of high molecular  DNA (16-20 kb) per gram of the biofilm sample, with an A260/280 and A260/230 ratio of about 2. Furthermore, amplification of 16S rRNA genes as well as restriction digestion with BamH1 and HindIII suggest that the newly developed method can minimize any inhibitory effects of contaminants. Results indicate that it is an appropriate methodology for the extraction of total genomic DNA for functional metagenomic studies and may be applicable to other environmental samples from which DNA extraction is challenging. IMPORTANCE: Our present knowledge of microorganisms and their enzymes from deep mine subsurface is based largely on laboratory studies of pure microbial cultures. These methods tend to hit nearly only 1% of the entire microbial community, In this regard, Metagenomics, has emerged as a strategic approach to explore unculturable microbes through the sequencing and analysis of DNA extracted from the environmental samples.

In order to develop a simplified process with a stronger purity of protease, we investigated the  earthworm and  lugworm. We purified water extracts cut off at 10 kDa of molecular  using ultrafiltration because proteins are large biomolecules, or macromolecules, consisting of one or more long chains of amino  residues. We purified EW1 (raw earthworm extract), EW2 (molecular  (m.w) > 10 kDa of earthworm extract), and EW3 (m.w < 10 kDa) from the  earthworm. Likewise, we purified LW1 (wild lugworm extract), LW2 (m.w > 10 kDa), and LW3 (m.w < 10 kDa) from the  lugworm. Using a fibrin assay, we found that fibrinolytic activity of the specimens had a rank order of clear zone diameter: EW2 > EW1 > EW3 > LW2 > LW1 > LW3. In particular, EW2 and LW2 showed a potent fibrinolytic effect in two different worm specimens. The protein content of each sample was detected as 2.34 (EW1), 3.03 (EW2), 2.80 (LW1), 3.71 (LW2) mg/ml respectively, and their molecular  were measured using SDS-PAGE. The samples contained the following amounts of total fatty : EW1, 3.61%; EW2, 0.48%; LW1, 4.96%; and LW2, 0.23%.

Gas chromatography (GC) is the most widely used technique for determining HAAs. Due to their polar nature, derivatization prior to GC analysis is required. Typically, derivatization is undertaken with acidic methanol, which converts HAAs to the corresponding methyl ester (haloacetic  methyl esters, abbreviated as HAAMEs), and HAAs are quantified by measuring HAAMEs. In this study, the interference from two other groups of DBPs, the haloacetonitriles (HANs) and haloacetamides (HAMs), on the determination of HAAs was investigated. HANs and HAMs at a range of concentrations (0, 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100 µg/L) were subjected to the same derivatization and analytical procedures as HAAs. The stability of HANs and HAMs under strongly acidic conditions was assessed and the operative mechanism of interference was investigated. The results showed that HAMs significantly interfered with the determination of the corresponding HAAs and the transformation rates of HAMs (representing the extent of HAMs transforming to corresponding HAAMEs) ranged from 6.5 to 45.7%, while the impact of HANs can be neglected. The stability of HANs and HAMs under strongly acidic conditions indicated that hydrolysis was not the cause of the interference. Instead, it was proposed that HAMs react with methyl alcohol, to generate the same corresponding HAAMEs that was generated when HAAs reacted with methyl alcohol. A method for revising HAA concentrations in the presence of HAMs is suggested.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFAs) are essential nutrients and normal components for development. The aims of this study are to investigate the effects of maternal deprivation (MD) stress and maternal dietary of n-3 PUFAs on the physical and neurobiological developments of offspring. According to the content of n-3 PUFAs in diets, female dams were divided into three groups ( = 6-7): deficiency, control and supplementary. MD paradigm was performed 6 h a day from postnatal days (PND) 1 to PND 14. The physical parameters and neurobehavioral tests were measured. Different effects of MD stress, maternal diet and time on physical and neurobehavioral developments were observed. There was an interaction among stress, diet and time on . MD stress markedly decreased  among different diet groups, while deficiency diet significantly increased  on PND 21 in N-MD pups and on PND 14 in MD pups. Moreover, MD stress delayed fur appearance and eye opening, whereas deficiency diet accelerated eye opening. On cliff avoidance and rearing frequency, MD pups performed worse; however a subtle delay on the surface righting was observed in supplementary group. Additionally, MD pups performed worse on PND 14 in forelimb grip. Unfortunately, there were no significant effects on incisor eruption, locomotion frequency and negative geotaxis. This study suggests that early MD and inadequate intake of n-3 PUFAs are harmful to optimal growth and neurobehavioral development.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659563>Formulation and Evaluation of Novel Thiolated Intra Pocket Periodontal Composite Membrane of Doxycycline.</a></h1><p>Localized intra-pocket, retentive, biodegradable, prolonged release thiolated membrane can provide an improved therapeutic efficacy of doxycycline at the site of action with evading off target side effects. To this end, thiolated chitosan-hyaluronic  composite polymeric complex next-generation of the periodontal membrane was manufactured by solvent casting method. FTIR spectroscopic analysis displayed successful immobilization of thiol groups on the manufactured thiolated periodontal membrane. Moreover, XRD, DSC, AFM and TGA of the membrane confirmed the compatibility of ingredients and modifications in surface chemistry. The thiolated periodontal film was also investigated in terms of thickness,  uniformity, water-uptake capacity, drug content, pH, entrapment efficiency, lysozymal degradation and release patterns. Also, mucoadhesion profile was explored on gingival mucosa. The immobilized thiol groups on thiolated chitosan and thiolated hyaluronate were found to be 168 ± 11 μM/g (mean ± SD, n = 3) and 189 ± 8 μM/g (mean ± SD, n = 3) respectively. Swelling capacity of the thiolated periodontal membrane was significantly ∼2-fold higher (p < 0.05) as compared to unmodified membrane. The obtained thiolated membrane depicted 3 -old higher mucoadhesive features as compared to the un-modified membrane. In vitro release kinetics indicated approximately more than 80% prolonged release within 7 days. Mechanical strength of the Thiolated bandage was also significantly ∼2-fold higher (p < 0.05) as compared to unmodified membrane. Ex-vivo retention study revealed enhanced retention of thiolated membrane as compared to unmodified membrane. In-vitro antimicrobial studies demonstrated that thiolated membrane could efficiently kill Porphyromonas gingivalis cells as compared to the native membrane. Moreover, ex-vivo biodegradation results indicated that 90% of the thiolated membrane was biodegradable in 28 days.

Fluorescence spectroscopy is typically employed to characterise DOM. Here, the interaction between DOM and trace metals was investigated by combining excitation-emission matrix (EEM) quenching with two-dimensional Savitzky-Golay second-order differentiation (2D-SG-2nd-df) analysis. The 2D-SG-2nd-df analysis decomposed the EEM spectra of commercial humic  (HA) samples into six separate fluorescence peaks, which agreed with the results obtained through conventional parallel factor (PARAFAC) analysis. Compared with PARAFAC modeling, the 2D-SG-2nd-df approach provided more valid and reliable results when the dataset contained distinct samples. Moreover, since the results obtained from 2D-SG-2nd-df for each sample are independent, shifts in the peak wavelength can be reproduced more efficiently using this method. Triplicate titration experiments showed clear differences in HA-copper interactions for samples with different HA composition and molecular . The binding strength between copper and low-molecular- DOM in water was weaker than that observed for high-molecular- DOM. The results obtained in this study will serve as a basis for applying 2D-SG-2nd-df not only to DOM but also to other samples studied using EEM measurements.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The HAP strain isolated from roach intestine was Enterococcus faecium strain CGMCC1.2136. The experiment was a simple completely randomized design and lasted for eight weeks. Two hundred and seventy fish with an average  of 12 g randomly distributed into nine tanks. The trial consisted of three treatments with three respective replications. During the experimental period, fish received basal diet without any bacterial supplementation (as the control group), basal diet enriched with 10 CFU g HAP or 10 CFU g CP. At the end of the experiment, serum immune parameters of those fish fed HAP including alkaline phosphatase activity, total protein content, total immunoglobulin level, lysozyme activity and complement activity (ACH50) were significantly higher that other experimental groups (P < 0.05). Similarly, dietary supplementation of HAP resulted in better mucosal immune parameters in comparison to control group and commercial probiotic administration (P < 0.05). Intestinal heterotrophic bacteria and autochthonous LAB counts of those fish fed HAP were significantly higher than other experimental groups at the end of the experiment as well as 15 days seizing probiotic administrations (P < 0.05). Fish fed with HAP containing diet presented significantly higher amylase, lipase and protease activity in comparison to the CP fed fish and the control group (P < 0.05). Growth indices of those fish fed HAP were significantly higher than other treatments (P < 0.05). The highest carcass protein and ash content along with the lowest  moisture content belonged to those fish received HAP (P < 0.05). In conclusion, the use host-HAP resulted in better immune competence and growth performance and it seems aquaculture sector should probably focus on the development of probiotics isolated from the cultured species instead of using terrestrial probiotics with greatly different requirements and environmental conditions.Copyright © 2019.

However, for hypermetabolic conditions stemming from burn trauma or cancer cachexia, browning is thought to contribute to energy wasting and supraphysiological nutritional requirements. Metformin's impact on this phenomenon and underlying mechanisms have not been explored.We used both a murine burn model and human ex vivo adipose explants to assess metformin and 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide (AICAR)'s effects on the development of subcutaneous beige adipose. Enzymes involved in fat homeostasis and browning, as well as mitochondrial dynamics, were assessed to determine metformin's effects.Treatment with the biguanide metformin lowers lipolysis in beige fat by inducing protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) independently of adenosine monophosphate kinase (AMPK) activation. Increased PP2A activity catalyzes the dephosphorylation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (Ser 79) and hormone sensitive lipase (Ser 660), thus promoting fat storage and the "whitening" of otherwise lipolytic beige adipocytes. Moreover, co-incubation of metformin with the PP2A inhibitor okadaic  countered the anti-lipolytic effects of this biguanide in human adipose. Additionally, we show that metformin does not activate this pathway in the WAT of control mice and that AICAR sustains the browning of white adipose, offering further evidence that metformin acts independently of this cellular energy sensor.This work provides novel insights into the mechanistic underpinnings of metformin's therapeutic benefits and potential as an agent to reduce the lipotoxicity associated with hypermetabolism and adipose browning.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Overall, the studies presented low risk of bias to construct and statistical validity. However, the majority presented a high risk of attrition and detection bias. In vitro studies (n = 8) consistently demonstrated that SCFA stimulate leptin expression in adipocytes through activation of free fatty  receptor 3 (FFAR3). In animal studies (n = 24), interventions to modulate high-fat diet outcomes predominantly caused a decrease in circulating leptin levels and increased SCFA, associated with suppressed  gain. Control of dysbiosis through administration of prebiotics and probiotics also played a role in leptin synthesis in animal studies. In human studies (n = 4) leptin was mainly correlated with adiposity but dysbiosis interfered with this relationship. We conclude that the association between SCFA and leptin remains incompletely understood but occurs mainly through the activation of FFAR3 in adipocytes. However,  fat rather than SCFA remains the main driver for leptin synthesis in vivo. Future studies should aim to better clarify the role of SCFA in regulating leptin production in vivo.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Here, inspired by natural sponges, a novel of multi-functional polymer sponges was developed which were fabricated by ice-templating with multi-functional amine (PEI) and diepoxide cross-linker (PEG-DE) for highly efficient harvesting of dyes and simultaneous pure water recovery both in mechanic pressing and filtration processes. The as-prepared sponge (SP-1) was further modified by poly(caffeic ) through a simple dipping-crosslinking process to obtain the hybrid polymer sponge (SP-2), which showed higher compress strength than SP-1. These sponges possessed a crosslinked three-dimensional (3D) macroporous structure with quick water absorbing property over ten times of their own  within 20 seconds directed by capillary. The adsorption behavior of the obtained polymer sponges to eleven hydrophilic dyes was studied in detail by mechanic induced separation. All these polymer sponges exhibited the high selective adsorption to hydrophilic dyes in water. For example, SP-1 has high adsorption capacity over 150 μmol/g to Erythrosin B (ETB), which is 20 times higher than that of Calcein. With the modified poly(caffeic ) layer, SP-2 exhibited a different adsorption properties for Methylene Blue (MB, 180 μmol/g) to SP-1(~0 μmol/g), indicating that the tailorable structures of sponge can regulate their selectivity to guest molecules. Based on the unique recognition to guest molecules, the methodology of dynamic separation of dye's mixture in water was demonstrated by using these sponges through mechanical pressing or fast filtration, which provides a facile alternative with easy-operation for water purification.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669276>The antioxidant activities of balsam pear polysaccharide.</a></h1><p>The antioxidant activities of polysaccharide from balsam pear were studied. It was determined by gel permeation chromatography that the molecular  distribution of purified polysaccharide was concentrated near 33582Da. It indicated that the monosaccharide components were rhamnose, galacturonic , galactose, xylose and arabinose. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance and Congo red experiments showed that there are C1, C2, C3, C5 links, and stable β-triple helix conformation in aqueous solution.

To use MLR, firstly the most important input data were selected, and then, the best model to predict the taste of orange was applied. In this research, methodology of ANFIS consisted of selection of dependent orange taste, fuzzification, fuzzy inference rule, membership function, and defuzzification process. The predictive capability of these models was evaluated by various descriptive statistical indicators such as mean square error () and determination coefficient ( ). The results showed that the prediction performance of the MLR model has a strong significant relationship between orange taste and vitamin C (0.897), red color (0.901), and blue color (0.713). Also, the results of ANFIS model showed that with low error for train and check data increased the most accuracy for prediction of orange taste. Moreover, the results indicated that the success rate of taste determination for orange is higher by using ANFIS compared to the MLR.

Herein, we incorporated a simple hard-template approach to synthesise single crystal nanoplates of HA. We used the 2D graphitic nitride (g-C3N4) material to prepare an HA sol-gel under hydrothermal conditions. A new HA nanostructure was then formed during the calcination and removal of g-C3N4 at a higher temperature, which finally led to the production of nanoplates (thickness of ∼100 nm) while in lateral dimension the average size was in the micrometre scale. We characterised the synthesised HA nanoplates with XRD, TEM, and HRTEM. The theoretically predicted nanostructure construction based on Wulff's method is in full agreement with the experimental observations. We then prepared different  ratios of HA and polylactic  (PLA) composites for artificial 3D bone fabrication. The strong interaction between PLA and HA's (110) facet, which was the second most prevalent, resulted in the composite's mechanical robustness. After mechanical testing, an optimum ratio was selected for biological studies and 3D printing. Biological experiments demonstrated that the synthesised composite had excellent viability in vitro.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660546></a></h1><p></p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669589>VDR regulates energy metabolism by modulating remodeling in adipose tissue.</a></h1><p>Vitamin D receptor (VDR) plays an important role in regulating energy metabolism. Adipose tissue is a vital metabolic organ in energy balance and glucose homeostasis. In this study, we investigated the role of VDR expressed on adipose tissue in the balance of energy metabolism. This study was conducted in VDR-KO mice, VDR-Tg mice and wild-type mice. Energy metabolism was determined based on the energy expenditure, oxygen consumption, respiratory exchange rate, food and water intake, and a cool room test. VDR expression in the tissues of VDR-Tg mice was assessed by western blotting. The levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides, free fatty , leptin, and glucose were assessed using the respective kits. Insulin resistance in the whole  was evaluated by an intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test and insulin tolerance test. mRNA associated with energy metabolism expression in adipose and skeletal muscle tissue was examined by RT-PCR. Our results show that overexpression of VDR in adipose tissue induced an increase in , fat mass, and serum lipid levels, and a decline in energy metabolism; these changes were ameliorated by VDR-KO mice. Overexpression of VDR in the adipose tissue of VDR-Tg mice induced a state of insulin resistance, which corresponded with decreased expression of UCP1, UCP2, UCP3, CPT2 and HK in both white adipose tissue and brown adipose tissue; these changes were also reversed by VDR-KO mice. Our study confirms that expression levels of VDR in adipose tissue play pivotal roles in energy balance and glycolipid metabolism by regulating adipose tissue remodeling.Copyright © 2019.

However, their roles in membrane fouling mechanism during drinking water treatment by ultrafiltration (UF) have remained elusive. Herein, by using water insoluble polyvinylpolypyrrolidone (PVPP) resins, we sequestered the phenolic moieties from a model DOM (Suwannee River DOM, SRDOM) and characterized their molecular profiles using electrospray ionization coupled with Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (ESI-FT-ICR-MS). Subsequently, their roles in UF membrane fouling propensity were investigated using reconstituted DOM solutions with various concentrations of phenolic moieties. The results showed that the phenolic moieties were of higher molecular  and rich in unsaturation cyclic structures and oxygen-rich groups. Van Krevelen diagrams revealed that the sequestered sample was rich in aromatics structures and tannins-like compounds while contained less alicyclic organic  in comparison with the original SRDOM, which was consistent with the aromaticity index (AI) analysis. UF experiments showed that the more phenolic moieties in DOM solution, the severer decline of flux was observed. The phenolic moieties played a significant role in membrane irremovable fouling due to the hydrophobic interactions and their higher molecular  as evidenced by membrane cleaning tests. By surface characterization, the SRDOM fouled membrane was identified to have a higher water contact angle value and abundant C-O groups, likely due to the adsorption of more hydrophobic phenolic moieties. Overall, these findings highlighted links between phenolic moieties and membrane fouling development, and implied that membrane performance could be improved by pre-removal of phenolic moieties in DOM.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

As a typical surfactant, R-6-AO not only stabilizes oil-in-water (O/W) emulsions at concentrations above its critical micelle concentration (cmc) of 0.6 mM, but also forms gel emulsions at concentrations beyond the CGC with the oil volume fraction freely adjustable between 2% and 95%. Cryo-TEM images reveal that R-6-AO molecules self-assemble into left-handed helical fibers with cross-sectional diameters of about 10 nm in pure water which can be turned to very stable hydrogels at concentrations above the CGC. Compared with traditional high internal phase emulsions, the gel emulsions stabilized by R-6-AO can be prepared with different oils such as n-dodecane, n-decane, n-octane, soybean oil, olive oil and tricaprylin, due to the tricyclic diterpene hydrophobic structure in their molecules which enable them to adopt a unique arrangement in the fibers. The intriguing properties of gel emulsions stabilized by R-6-AO are believed to be significant and helpful for the preparation of new soft materials and other applications.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Biomolecules exhibit a wide range of functions and structures, including chemical recognition (of enzyme substrates or adhesive ligands, for instance), exquisite nanostructures (composed of peptides, proteins or nucleic ), and unusual mechanical properties (such as silk-like strength, stiffness, viscoelasticity and resiliency). Here we combine the computational design of physical (noncovalent) interactions with pathway-dependent, hierarchical 'click' covalent assembly to produce hybrid synthetic peptide-based polymers. The nanometre-scale monomeric units of these polymers are homotetrameric, α-helical bundles of low-molecular- peptides. These bundled monomers, or 'bundlemers', can be designed to provide complete control of the stability, size and spatial display of chemical functionalities. The protein-like structure of the bundle allows precise positioning of covalent linkages between the ends of distinct bundlemers, resulting in polymers with interesting and controllable physical characteristics, such as rigid rods, semiflexible or kinked chains, and thermally responsive hydrogel networks. Chain stiffness can be controlled by varying only the linkage. Furthermore, by controlling the amino  sequence along the bundlemer periphery, we use specific amino  side chains, including non-natural 'click' chemistry functionalities, to conjugate moieties into a desired pattern, enabling the creation of a wide variety of hybrid nanomaterials.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657510>The Buckwheat Iminosugar d-Fagomine Attenuates Sucrose-Induced Steatosis and Hypertension in Rats.</a></h1><p>This study examines the long-term functional effects of d-fagomine on sucrose- induced factors of metabolic dysfunctions and explores possible molecular mechanisms behind its action.Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rats were fed a 35% sucrose solution with d-fagomine (or not, for comparison) or mineral water (controls) for 24 weeks.

GDM may be induced by dysregulation of pancreatic β-cell function and/or by alteration of secreted gestational hormones and peptides related with glucose homeostasis. It may affect one out of five pregnancies, leading to perinatal morbidity and adverse neonatal outcomes, and high risk of chronic metabolic and cardiovascular injuries in both mother and offspring. Currently, GDM diagnosis is based on evaluation of glucose homeostasis at late stages of pregnancy, but increased age and , and familiar or previous occurrence of GDM, may conditionate this criteria. In addition, an earlier and more specific detection of GDM with associated metabolic and cardiovascular risk could improve GDM development and outcomes. In this sense, 1st-2nd trimester-released biomarkers found in maternal plasma including adipose tissue-derived factors such as adiponectin, visfatin, omentin-1, fatty -binding protein-4 and retinol binding-protein-4 have shown correlations with GDM development. Moreover, placenta-related factors such as sex hormone-binding globulin, afamin, fetuin-A, fibroblast growth factors-21/23, ficolin-3 and follistatin, or specific micro-RNAs may participate in GDM progression and be useful for its recognition.

To evaluate the anti-diabetic effects of insoluble- (BIF) and soluble fibers (BSF) enzymatically isolated from barley, a conventional rat model and a type 2 diabetes rat model were used. Our results showed that 4-week treatment of BIF or BSF effectively reduced FBG in the diabetic condition, with caecal level of propionic  and minor SCFAs increased by BIF and that of butyric  and insulin sensitivity improved by BSF, respectively. The two treatments further ameliorated liver function, judged by the recovered serum level of ALT, albumin and total protein levels. BIF and BSF also increased HDL-C and decreased serum MDA. In normal rats, BIF and BSF showed a hypolipidaemic effect in triglycerides and LDL-C, reduced  and enhanced the caecal production of minor SCFAs. Furthermore, the two treatments reduced the caecal level of butyric  while BSF increased that of propionic .

The concept of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO), a condition of abnormal proliferation of the small intestine microbiota, has been proposed as a form of small intestine dysbiosis. In Parkinson's disease patients,  loss and metabolic disorders such as lipid abnormalities are frequently encountered. This was a prospective investigation of the presence of SIBO using the lactulose breath test, Parkinson's disease symptoms, medications, abdominal symptoms, and blood data involving 39 Parkinson's disease patients. Of the 39 patients, 19 were positive for SIBO, 16 were negative, and 4 were equivocal. SIBO-positive patients had a significantly smaller dopaminergic drug load (dopamine replacement of Parkinson's disease drug potency) (P = 0.009) and significantly lower serum triglyceride (TG) (P = 0.024) and total bilirubin (P = 0.019) levels. No relationship was seen between the presence or absence of SIBO and motor or abdominal symptoms. The following hypothesis was developed with regard to the possibility that intestinal bacterial overgrowth has various effects that are exhibited via bile  metabolism in Parkinson's disease patients. Serum bilirubin levels become higher as bilirubin metabolism declines with decreases in the intestinal bacteria. At the same time, bile  is broken down due to increased intestinal bacteria, and lipid absorption decreases. This induces low serum TG levels and leads to  loss. By a similar mechanism, there is less absorption of vitamin D as bile  levels decrease, leading to osteoporosis and fractures. The possibility that some of the non-motor manifestations accompanying Parkinson's disease are caused by intestinal dysbiosis needs to be considered.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Common carp (Cyprinus carpio) is a representative eurythermic fish that can survive at a wide range of ambient temperatures, allowing it to live in an extensive geographical range. The goal of this work was to study the glucose metabolism of common carp at different temperatures and determine the miRNAs involved in the regulation of glucose metabolism. We determined the indicators related to glucose metabolism after long-term temperature stress and constructed nine small RNA libraries of livers under different temperature stress (5 °C, 17 °C, and 30 °C, with three biological replicates for each temperature), and subjected these samples to high-throughput sequencing. A positive relationship was observed between  gain rate (WGR) and temperature increase after 18 days of temperature stress. However, the glucose level in the plasma maintained a gentle decrease. Unexpectedly, liver lactic  levels were elevated in HTG (high temperature group) and LTG (low temperature group). Six down-regulated miRNAs (miR-122, miR-30b, miR-15b-5p, miR-20a-5p, miR-1, and miR-7b) were identified as involved in the regulation of glycolysis. Twelve genes were predicted as targets of these miRNAs, and these genes are in pathways related to pyruvate metabolism, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, and the citrate cycle (TCA cycle). The results allowed prediction of a potential regulatory network of miRNAs involved in the regulation of glycolysis. The target genes of six down-regulated miRNAs were up-regulated under temperature stress, including Aldolase C, fructose-bisphosphate, b (ALDOCB), multiple inositol-polyphosphate phosphatase 1 (MINPP1), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase 1 (PCK1), pyruvate dehydrogenase E1 alpha 1 (PDHA1), aldehyde dehydrogenase 9 family member A1a (ALDH9A1A), Acetyl-coenzyme A synthetase (ACSS), lactate dehydrogenase b (LDH-b), and glyoxylate reductase/hydroxypyruvate reductase (GRHPR). Other key genes of glycolysis, glucose transporter 1 (GLUT-1), pyruvate kinase PKM (PKM), and mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC) were significantly up-regulated in LTG and HTG. Overall, the results suggest that miRNAs maintain their energy requirements by regulating glycolysis and play an important role in the molecular response to cold and heat stress of common carp. These data provide the foundation for further studies of the role of miRNAs in environmental adaptation in fish.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Sixty Holstein cows, 27 multiparous and 33 primiparous, were blocked by parity and milk yield in the first 20 d in milk (DIM) and randomly assigned to receive 0, 0.5, or 1.0 g/d of LY, resulting in daily intakes of 0, 14.2, and 37.6 billion cells, respectively, of Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain CNCM I-1077 from 30 to 107 DIM. Cows were milked twice daily, dry matter intake (DMI) and milk yield were measured daily, and milk components, , and  condition were measured weekly. Blood was sampled weekly and plasma analyzed for concentrations of glucose, fatty , urea N, haptoglobin, serum amyloid A, and -soluble protein. Digestibility of nutrients was measured in the last 2 wk of the experiment. Ruminal fluid was collected on 2 consecutive days 6 h after the morning feeding for measurements of pH, concentrations of short chain fatty , and NH-N. Feeding behavior was observed for 48 h on experiment d 21 and 63. The mean ambient temperature was 26.8°C, humidity was 83.2%, and the temperature and humidity index ranged from 73 to 81. Treatment did not affect rectal temperature (38.9 ± 0.04°C) or DMI but increased yield of energy-corrected milk (ECM; 35.2 vs. 36.1 vs. 37.2 kg/d for 0, 0.5, and 1.0 g/d, respectively) and efficiency of conversion of DM into ECM (1.70, 1.79, and 1.83 for 0, 0.5, and 1 g/d, respectively). Feeding LY increased digestibility of crude protein (65.1 vs. 68.8 vs. 70.4%) and neutral detergent fiber (NDF; 47.5 vs. 49.2 vs. 55.2%), and concentration of acetate (64.7 vs. 69.1 vs. 72.2 mM), which resulted in increased concentration of total short chain fatty  in ruminal fluid (110.3 vs. 117.7 vs. 121.4 mM). Mean ruminal pH increased (5.99 vs. 6.03 vs. 6.26), and proportion of cows with pH <5.8 decreased linearly (42.9 vs. 34.9 vs. 7.7%) with increasing inclusion of LY. Concentrations of acute-phase proteins decreased with increasing amount of LY. Some aspects of feeding behavior were altered by LY, and meal size reduced quadratically (3.2, 3.5, and 2.9 kg of DM, respectively), whereas interval between rumination bouts tended to reduce linearly (122, 96.5, and 90.7 min, respectively) with increasing dose of LY. Chewing time per kilogram of NDF tended to increase linearly (71.6, 71.3, and 81.6 min/kg, respectively) with increasing dose of LY. The estimated net energy for lactation of the diet increased 5.2%, from 1.72 Mcal/kg of DM for 0 g of LY to 1.81 Mcal/kg for 1 g of LY. Feeding 1 g of LY/d to cows under heat stress increased yield of ECM and efficiency of feed conversion into ECM, improved diet digestibility, and increased ruminal fluid pH; these responses might be related either to direct effects of LY on ruminal microbial activity or to changes in feeding behavior that improved digestion of cows in heat stress.Copyright © 2020 American Dairy Science Association.

In many cases, the relationship between the chemical structure of the gelator and the emergent hydrogel properties is poorly understood. As a result, empirical screening strategies instead of rational design approaches are often relied upon to tune the emergent properties of the gels. Herein, we describe a novel strategy to identify improved phenylalanine (Phe) derived gelators using a focused empirical approach. Fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc) protected Phe derivatives are a privileged class of gelators that spontaneously self-assemble into fibrils that entangle to form a hydrogel network upon dissolution into water. However, the Fmoc group has been shown to have toxicity drawbacks for potential biological applications, requiring the identification of new N-terminal modifications that promote efficient self-assembly but lack the shortcomings of the Fmoc group. We previously discovered that fibrils in Fmoc-p-nitrophenylalanine (Fmoc-4-NO-Phe) hydrogels transition to crystalline microtubes after several hours by a mechanism that involves the hierarchical assembly and fusion of the hydrogel fibrils. We hypothesized that this hierarchical crystallization behavior could form the basis of a screening approach to identify alternative N-terminal functional groups to replace Fmoc in Phe-derived LMW gelators. Specifically, screening N-terminal modifying groups for 4-NO-Phe that stabilize the hydrogel state by preventing subsequent hierarchical crystallization would facilitate empirical identification of functional Fmoc replacements. To test this approach, we screened a small series of 4-NO-Phe derivatives with various N-terminal modifying groups to determine if any provided stable LMW supramolecular hydrogels. All but one of the 4-NO-Phe derivatives assembled into crystalline forms. Only the 1-naphthaleneacetic  (1-Nap) 4-NO-Phe derivative self-assembled into a stable hydrogel network. Additional Phe derivatives were modified by N-terminal 1-Nap-Phe groups to confirm the general potential of 1-Nap as a suitable replacement for Fmoc, and all derivatives formed stable hydrogels under similar conditions to their Fmoc-Phe counterparts. These results illustrate the potential of this approach to identify next-generation Phe-derived LMW gelators with improved emergent properties.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660636>Evaluation of the inflammatory response to two intra-articular hyaluronic  formulations in normal equine joints.</a></h1><p>Intra-articular (IA) hyaluronic  (HA) is commonly used to treat equine arthritis. Inflammatory response or "joint flare" is a recognized potential side effect. However, the incidence and severity of inflammation following IA HA injection in horses is not well documented. This study compared the effects of two IA HA formulations of different molecular  (MW) and a saline control on clinical signs and synovial fluid markers of inflammation in normal equine joints. Eight adult horses each had three healthy fetlock joints randomly assigned to treatment with either 1.4 mega Dalton HA, 0.8 mega Dalton HA or saline control once weekly for three weeks. Clinical evaluation and synovial fluid analysis were performed by blinded assessors. Outcomes of interest were lameness score, joint effusion score and synovial fluid white cell count and differential, total protein, viscosity and serum amyloid A. Joints injected with HA developed significant mild-to-moderate inflammatory responses often associated with lameness and joint effusion compared with saline control joints. The higher MW HA formulation elicited a significantly greater inflammatory response than the lower MW HA after the first injection. In HA injected joints, viscosity remained poor for the entire study. Both IA HA formulations in this study induced an inflammatory response in healthy equine joints. This may have implications for the use of HA in equine joints. The findings in this study are limited to the two HA formulations used. Further investigation of different HA formulations and the use of HA in normal and arthritic equine joints is warranted.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31678737>3D microtissue-derived human stem cells seeded on electrospun nanocomposites under shear stress: Modulation of gene expression.</a></h1><p>Different microenvironments trigger distinct differentiation of stem cells. Even without chemical supplementation, mechanical stimulation by shear stress may help to induce the desired differentiation. The cell format, such as three-dimensional (3D) microtissues (MTs), MT-derived cells or single cells (SCs), may have a pivotal impact as well. Here, we studied modulation of gene expression in human adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) exposed to shear stress and/or after MT formation.Electrospun meshes of poly-lactic-co-glycolic  and amorphous calcium phosphate nanoparticles (PLGA/aCaP) at a  ratio of 60:40 were seeded with human ASCs as MTs or as SCs and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without chemical supplementation. After 2 weeks of static culture, the scaffolds were cultured statically for another 2 weeks or placed in a Bose® bioreactor with a flow rate per area of 0.16 mL cm min. Stiffness of the scaffolds was assessed as a function of time. After 4 weeks, minimum stem cell criteria markers and selected markers of osteogenesis, endothelial cell differentiation, adipogenesis and chondrogenesis were analysed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Additionally, cell distribution within the scaffolds and the allocation of the yes-associated protein (YAP) in the cells were assessed by immunohistochemistry.MTs decayed completely within 2 weeks after seeding on PLGA/aCaP. The osteogenic marker gene alkaline phosphatase and the endothelial cell marker gene CD31 were upregulated in MT-derived ASCs compared with SCs. Shear stress realised by fluid flow perfusion upregulated peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma 2 expression in MT-derived ASCs and in SCs. The nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio of YAP expression was doubled under perfusion compared with that under static culture for MT-derived ASCs and SCs.Osteogenic and angiogenic commitments were more pronounced in MT-derived ASCs seeded on bone biomimetic electrospun nanocomposite PLGA/aCaP than in SCs seeded without induction medium. Furthermore, the static culture was superior to the perfusion regimen used here, as shear stress resulted in adipogenic commitment for MT-derived ASCs and SCs, although the YAP nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio indicated higher cell tensions under perfusion, usually associated with preferred osteogenic differentiation.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

These enzymes present in a diverse array of species, including fungi and bacteria. Since this enzyme is in the market for different usages from industry to medicine, having a better knowledge of its structures and properties from diverse sources will be useful to select the most appropriate candidate for different purposes. In the current study, sequence- and structure-based characteristics of these enzymes from fungi and bacteria, including pseudo amino  composition (PseAAC), physicochemical characteristics, and their secondary structures, are being compared and classified. Autodock 4 software was used for docking analysis between these laccases and some phenolic and non-phenolic compounds. The results indicated that features including molecular , aliphatic, extinction coefficient, and random coil percentage of these protein groups present high degrees of diversity in most cases. Categorization of these enzymes by the notion of PseAAC, showed over 96% accuracy. The binding free energy between fungal laccases and their substrates showed to be considerably higher than those of bacterial ones. According to the outcomes of the current study, data mining methods by using different machine learning algorithms, especially neural networks, could provide valuable information for a fair comparison between fungal and bacterial laccases. These results also suggested an association between efficacy and physicochemical features of laccase enzymes from different sources.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31680073>Evaluation of the efficacy of different sources of omega-3 fatty  in polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) induced rats.</a></h1><p>The study was planned to check the beneficial effects of various sources of omega-3 fatty  (synthetic, flaxseed oil, fish oil) on 45 Wistar female rats. The rats were divided into five groups and assigned to different diets i.e. NC (Negative control), PC (Positive control), SO (Synthetic omega-3 250mg/kg/orally/daily), FO (flaxseed oil 250mg/kg/orally/daily) and F (fish oil 250mg/kg/orally/diet). Animals fed on different diets were induced PCOS by an intramuscular (IM) injection of estradiol-valerate (4mg/rat/IM) except NC group. Results of the lipid profile indicated that F showed highest increase in HDL level (35.67±1.45), while cholesterol, LDL, triglycerides, blood glucose and  were reduced in all three treatment groups. In case of a hormonal profile, testosterone, luteinizing hormone (LH) and insulin levels showed a significant reduction after treatments. It can be concluded form the study that different sources of omega-3 fatty  can be a new approach to treat the symptoms of PCOS.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664519>Dietary intervention using (1,3)/(1,6)-β-glucan, a fungus-derived soluble prebiotic ameliorates high-fat diet-induced metabolic distress and alters beneficially the gut microbiota in mice model.</a></h1><p>Western diet, rich in carbohydrates and fat, is said to be a major factor underlying metabolic syndrome. Interventions with prebiotics, the key modulators of the gut microbiota, have paramount impact on host-associated metabolic disorders. Herein, we investigated the effect of fungus-derived (1,3)/(1,6)-β-glucan, a highly soluble dietary fiber, on high-fat diet (HFD)-induced metabolic distress.Male C57BL/6 J mice were fed with different diet groups (n = 11): control diet, HFD, 3 g/kg or 5 g/kg of β-glucan-incorporated HFD. At the end of experimental study period (12th week), , feces  and fecal moisture content were observed. Further, colonic motility was measured using activated charcoal meal study. Proteins extracted from liver and intestine tissues were subjected to western blot technique. Paraffin-embedded intestinal tissues were sectioned for histochemical [Periodic -Schiff (PAS) and Alcian blue (AB) staining] analysis. Fecal microbiota analysis was performed using MOTHUR bioinformatic software.β-glucan consumption exhibited anti-obesity property in mice groups fed with HFD. In addition, β-glucan ameliorated HFD-induced hepatic stress, colonic motility and intestinal atrophy (reduction in colon length, goblet cells, and mucosal layer thickness). Further, β-glucan incorporation shifted bacterial community by increasing butyrate-producing bacteria such as Anaerostipes, Coprobacillus, and Roseburia and decreasing reportedly obesity-associated bacteria such as Parabacteroides and Lactococcus.Altogether, the outcomes of this present pre-clinical animal study show β-glucan to be a promising therapeutic candidate in the treatment of HFD-induced metabolic distress. Further comprehensive research has to be conducted to brace its clinical relevance, reproducibility and efficacy for aiding human health.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673703>Glucagon-Receptor Signaling Reverses Hepatic Steatosis Independent of Leptin Receptor Expression.</a></h1><p>Glucagon (GCG) is an essential regulator of glucose and lipid metabolism that also promotes  loss. We have shown that glucagon-receptor (GCGR) signaling increases fatty  oxidation (FAOx) in primary hepatocytes and reduces liver triglycerides in diet-induced obese (DIO) mice; however, the mechanisms underlying this aspect of GCG biology remains unclear. Investigation of hepatic GCGR targets elucidated a potent and previously unknown induction of leptin receptor (Lepr) expression. Liver leptin signaling is known to increase FAOx and decrease liver triglycerides, similar to glucagon action. Therefore, we hypothesized that glucagon increases hepatic LEPR, which is necessary for glucagon-mediated reversal of hepatic steatosis. Eight week-old control and liver-specific, LEPR-deficient mice (LeprΔliver) were placed on a high fat diet (HFD) for 12 weeks and then treated with a selective GCGR agonist (IUB288) for 14 days. Liver triglycerides and gene expression were assessed in liver tissue homogenates. Administration of IUB288 in both lean and DIO mice increased hepatic Lepr isoforms a-e in acute (4h) and chronic (72h,16d) (p<0.05) settings. LeprΔliver mice displayed increased hepatic triglycerides on a chow diet alone (p<0.05), which persisted in a DIO state (p<0.001), with no differences in  or composition. Surprisingly, chronic administration of IUB288 in DIO control and LeprΔliver mice reduced liver triglycerides regardless of genotype (p<0.05). Together these data suggest that GCGR activation induces hepatic Lepr expression and although hepatic glucagon and leptin signaling have similar liver lipid targets, these appear to be two distinct pathways.© Endocrine Society 2019.

Here we investigated Pb solubility in relation to Pb oxalate precipitation at pH 5.0 in the absence and presence of calcium (Ca), a common cation in environmental matrices. At Pb mole fractions less than 0.10, sequestration of Pb into Ca-oxalate to form a solid solution substantially lowered Pb solubility relative to that of pure Pb oxalate to an extent inversely proportional to the Pb mole fraction. Small Pb/Ca solid-solution distribution coefficients at these low mole ratios was largely attributed to the stronger complexation of Pb compared to Ca with oxalate to form soluble metal-oxalate complexes, which in turn limited Pb incorporation into the Ca-oxalate crystal lattice. Characterization of the Pb-Ca oxalate co-precipitates by X-ray diffraction, optical microscopy, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy revealed that the whewellite (Ca-oxalate monohydrate) structure was destabilized by substitution of small amounts of Pb into the lattice, and thus the formation of the Ca-oxalate dihydrate (weddellite) was favored over the monohydrate. At Pb mole fractions above 0.20, discrete crystallites of Pb-oxalate were identified. These new findings imply that Pb-Ca oxalate co-precipitates in the presence of Ca could reduce the solubility of Pb in Pb-contaminated  soils.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31675560>Association of prenatal pesticide exposures with adverse pregnancy outcomes and stunting in rural Bangladesh.</a></h1><p>Pesticide exposure during pregnancy is thought to adversely affect fetal growth, which in turn may impact child growth, but results have been inconsistent across studies and few have explored these effects in developing countries.To quantify urinary concentrations of pesticide biomarkers in early pregnancy (<16 weeks' gestation), and to estimate the association of these concentrations with preterm birth, low birth , small for gestational age, and stunting at ~1 and 2 years of age.Eight pesticide biomarkers were quantified in urine collected from 289 pregnant women (aged 18-40 years) participating in a birth cohort study in Bangladesh. Anthropometry measurements were conducted on the index child at birth and approximately 1 and 2 years of age. A directed acyclic graph was used to identify minimal sufficient adjustment sets. Log-binomial regression was used to estimate the relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridinol (TCPY), a metabolite of chlorpyrifos and chlorpyrifos methyl, and 4-nitrophenol, a metabolite of parathion and methyl parathion, were detected in nearly all women with geometric mean (95% CI) values of 3.17 (2.82-3.56) and 18.66 (17.03-20.46) µg/g creatinine, respectively. 3-phenoxybenzoic  (3-PBA), a non-specific metabolite of several pyrethroids, and 2-isopropyl-4-methyl-6-hydroxypyrimidine (IMPY), a diazinon metabolite, were detected in 19.8% and 16.1% of women, respectively. The remaining four pesticide biomarkers were detected in <10% of women. Women in the highest quartile of 4-nitrophenol were more than 3 times more likely to deliver preterm than women in the lowest quartile: unadjusted RR (95% CI), 3.57 (1.65, 7.73). Women in the highest quartile of 4-nitrophenol were also at increased risk of having a child born small for gestational age: RR (95% CI) adjusted for household income, maternal education, and maternal total energy and meat intake, 3.81 (1.10, 13.21). Women with detectable concentrations of IMPY were at increased risk of having a child born with low birth  compared to women with non-detectable concentrations: adjusted RR (95% CI), 2.13 (1.12, 4.08). We observed no association between any of the pesticide biomarkers and stunting at 1 or 2 years of age.Exposure to the insecticides parathion and diazinon during early pregnancy may increase the risk of adverse birth outcomes.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

This scenario has led to the occurrence of residues in the food chain. After several years of AMGs use in antibacterial therapy, resistance to streptomycin has begun to appear. The method lacks AMG specificity previously reported against a single antibiotic and described as selective. However, broad target specific nanoprobe would be ideal for detecting the entire class of AMGs. Thus, rapid and sensitive method for the ultrasensitive detection of AMGs is urgently needed.Gallic -coated silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) were demonstrated as nanoprobe for the colorimetric detection of AMGs (yellow to orange/red). A linear dynamic range of 50-650 pM was achieved readily by ratiometric spectrophotometry (A /A ) with a limit of detection (LOD) as low as 36 pM. The amine-groups of the AMGs functions as a molecular linker, wherein electrostatic coupling interactions between neighboring particles drives to form AgNP aggregates. The assay is further applicable to the determination of streptomycin residues in serum and milk samples.This study revealed the potential of AgNP probe for rapid and cost-effective detection of low molecular  target analytes, such as the AMGs. A ligand-induced aggregation of AgNPs coated with gallic  reported as a rapid and sensitive assay for AMGs. Analysis of streptomycin was demonstrated with excellent picomolar level sensitivity. Thus, the validated method can find practical applications in the ultrasensitive detection of AMGs in complex and diagnostic settings. This article is protected by copyright.

Parasitic haptens block antibodies, making it difficult to identify and detect them. ICs could be determined indirectly by  dissociative ELISA (DE) seroconversion in natural and experimental VL.We determined the frequency of samples that seroconverted in DE or presented a 10% increase in DE (ΔDE) in 3 types of VLs-hamster, canine, and human samples-with larger antigen determination by direct antigen capture in experimental samples.The ΔDE frequency is increased in all VL models: human (34%), canine (27%), and hamster (25%) samples. Seroconversion was present in hamster (14%), dog (1%), and human (6%) samples. During experimental infection, higher frequencies (28%) of circulating antigens were observed at the 30th day, associated with higher ΔDE (47%) and seroconversion (22%), with lower frequencies in other periods.The frequency of ΔED and seroconversion samples found in natural and experimental infection suggests that specific antibodies can be blocked by low molecular  antigens that interfere qualitatively (seroconversion) or quantitatively (ΔDE) in serology. Several antigen types may be involved, as high molecular  proteins and low molecular  glycoconjugates. The higher frequency of those indirect demonstrations of antibody-blocking antigen or haptens that could be -removed in VL has implications for the development of assays for detection of circulating or antibody-bound 1- to 3-kDa antigens, which could interfere in diagnosis and also in the immune response of the host.© 2019 American Association for Clinical Chemistry.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31683223>Effects of alfalfa particle size and starch content in diets on feeding behaviour, intake, rumen parameters, animal performance and meat quality of growing lambs.</a></h1><p>Thirty-two crossbred Merino branco male lambs were randomly allocated to eight diets, combining two forms of alfalfa presentation (chopped or ground), with four barley grain levels (0%, 11.2%, 21.3% and 33% dry matter (DM)), balanced by low starch agro-industrial by-products (LSBP). The diets were supplemented with 6% soybean oil and included 40% of alfalfa in DM. The lambs were individually housed and the trial lasted six weeks. Intake of DM, average daily  gain (ADG) and carcass  were higher with ground alfalfa (P < 0.01). Replacing barley grain by LSBP reduced linearly DM intake and ADG (P < 0.001) but increased meat tenderness (P = 0.046). Regardless of the treatments, meat showed a healthy biohydrogenation fatty  (FA) profile, with high proportions of t11-18:1, c9,t11-18:2 and a t10-18:1/t11-18:1 ratio clearly below 1. The reduction of barley in diet had a moderate positive impact on meat FA composition, decreasing t10-18:1, which was enhanced by the increase of forage particle size.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Blood was sampled before and 180 min after completion of each MTT. Subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) was collected after overnight fast and both MTTs. Prior to each investigation day, participants consumed a 4-week isocaloric diet of the same composition: (1) high-carb meals until 13:30 and high-fat meals between 16:30 and 22:00 or (2) the inverse order.12h-daily lipid patterns showed a complex regulation by both the time of day (67.8%) and meal composition (55.4%). A third of lipids showed a diurnal variation in postprandial responses to the same meal with mostly higher responses in the morning than in the afternoon. Triacylglycerols containing shorter and more saturated fatty  were enriched in the morning. SAT transcripts involved in fatty  synthesis and desaturation showed no diurnal variation. Diurnal changes of seven lipid classes were negatively associated with insulin sensitivity, but not with glucose and insulin response or insulin secretion.This study identified postprandial plasma lipid profiles as being strongly affected by meal timing and associated with insulin sensitivity.© Endocrine Society 2019.

We hypothesized that fecal samples representing the gut microbiota of rainbow trout could be associated with differential growth rates observed in fish breeding programs. If true, harnessing the functionality of this microbiota can improve the profitability of aquaculture. The first objective of this study was to test this hypothesis if gut microbiota is associated with fish growth rate (). Four full-sibling families were stocked in the same tank and fed an identical diet. Two fast-growing and two slow-growing fish were selected from each family for 16S rRNA microbiota profiling. Microbiota diversity varies with different DNA extraction methods. The second objective of this study was to compare the effects of five commonly used DNA extraction methods on the microbiota profiling and to determine the most appropriate extraction method for this study. These methods were Promega-Maxwell, Phenol-chloroform, MO-BIO, Qiagen-Blood/Tissue, and Qiagen-Stool. Methods were compared according to DNA integrity, cost, feasibility and inter-sample variation based on non-metric multidimensional scaling ordination (nMDS) clusters.Differences in DNA extraction methods resulted in significant variation in the identification of bacteria that compose the gut microbiota. Promega-Maxwell had the lowest inter-sample variation and was therefore used for the subsequent analyses. Beta diversity of the bacterial communities showed significant variation between breeding families but not between the fast- and slow-growing fish. However, an indicator analysis determined that cellulose, amylose degrading and amino  fermenting bacteria (Clostridium, Leptotrichia, and Peptostreptococcus) are indicator taxa of the fast-growing fish. In contrary, pathogenic bacteria (Corynebacterium and Paeniclostridium) were identified as indicator taxa for the slow-growing fish.DNA extraction methodology should be carefully considered for accurate profiling of the gut microbiota. Although the microbiota was not significantly different between the fast- and slow-growing fish groups, some bacterial taxa with functional implications were indicative of fish growth rate. Further studies are warranted to explore how bacteria are transmitted and potential usage of the indicator bacteria of fast-growing fish for development of probiotics that may improve fish health and growth.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672146>Short-term treatment with high dose liraglutide improves lipid and lipoprotein profile and changes hormonal mediators of lipid metabolism in obese patients with no overt type 2 diabetes mellitus: a randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over, double-blind clinical trial.</a></h1><p>Long-term treatment with up to 1.8 mg liraglutide improves cardiovascular and all-cause mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes at high risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and is currently under investigation in subjects without diabetes. Aim of our study was to investigate whether high dose (3 mg) short-term (5 weeks) treatment with liraglutide in obese patients with no overt type 2 diabetes affects metabolites, lipid and lipoprotein profile and components of activin-follistatin axis in cardiovascular beneficial or detrimental way.Twenty obese patients participated in a randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over, double-blind study and were administrated liraglutide 3 mg or placebo for 5 weeks. Metabolites, fatty , lipid-lipoprotein profile and concentrations of activins and follistatins (250 parameters) were assessed in serum at start and completion of each treatment.Concentrations of important cardiovascular markers such as total, free and remnant cholesterol were reduced with liraglutide before and after adjusting for  loss. Similarly, reductions in number of small and medium size LDL particles and in their total lipid concentration were observed with liraglutide and partially -loss related. Tyrosine levels were reduced and behenic  levels were increased whereas only minor changes were observed in HDL, VLDL and IDL. Concentrations of activin AB and follistatin were significantly reduced in liraglutide-treated group.Treatment of obese patients without overt type 2 diabetes with high dose of liraglutide for a short period of time induces changes in lipid-lipoprotein and hormonal profile that are suggestive of lower risk of atherosclerosis and CVD.

Alpha-ketoglutarate (AKG) has been reported to decrease dietary protein levels, promote intestinal health in piglets and reduce environmental pollution. However, the underlying mechanisms of AKG are largely unknown. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of low-protein diet supplementation of AKG on the growth performance, nitrogen metabolism, relative expression of amino  transporter genes and mTOR signalling pathway of skeletal muscle in piglets. Forty-eight piglets with an initial  of 11.53 ± 0.04 kg were randomly divided into four groups. Each group had four replicates, and each replicate had three pigs. A low-protein (LP) diet (crude protein was 14.96%) served as the control without AKG, while 0.5%, 1.0% and 1.5% AKG were added to the LP diet for the other experimental groups. The trial period lasted for 28 days. Compared with the LP group, the LP + 1.0%A and LP + 1.5%A groups increased the growth performance (p < .05);increased the mRNA levels of amino  transporters in the duodenum, anterior jejunum and posterior jejunum (p < .05); and reduced faecal nitrogen and urine nitrogen emissions (p < .05). They also showed greater mRNA levels and phosphorylated protein levels for S6 kinase beta (S6K) (p < .05), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) (p < .05) and 4E-binding protein 1 (4EBP1) (p < .05) in skeletal muscle. An LP diet supplemented with AKG activated the mTOR signalling and promoted the ability of the small intestine to absorb protein, thereby increasing protein deposition. Taken together, an LP diet supplemented with AKG provides a theoretical basis for the promotion and application of AKG in piglet production.© 2019 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662792>Transcribed ultraconserved region (T-UCR) uc.261 expression is closely correlated with disease activity and intestinal permeability in Crohn's disease.</a></h1><p>Transcribed ultraconserved region (T-UCR) uc.261 is reported to participate in intestinal mucosa barrier damage in Crohn's disease (CD).

The majority of the LMW gelators in these applications are based on functionalized peptides/amino  consisting of proteinogenic amino  which are proteolytically unstable. Herein, we have developed a new LMW gelator containing non-proteinogenic amino  namely 2,3-diaminopropionic  (Dap), a key precursor in the synthesis of many antibiotics namely viomycin and capreomycin, by functionalizing with fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl at both amino terminals of Dap [Fm-Dap(Fm)]. Hydrogelation test at different pH indicates that Fm-Dap(Fm) can form a hydrogel in a wide range of pH (4.9 to 9.1) with minimum hydrogelation concentration depends on the pH. The mechanical strength and thermal stability of the Fm-Dap(Fm) hydrogel material are found to decrease with increasing pH (acidic > neural/physiological > basic). The thermal stability of Fm-Dap(Fm) hydrogels is pH-dependent and elicits high stability at acidic pH. Also, Fm-Dap(Fm) hydrogels exhibit strong thixotropic property where regelation (self-healing) occurs upon release of stress. Morphological analysis indicates the formation of fibrils, which are entangled to form three dimensional network structures. Several spectroscopic measurements provided evidence for the self-assembly of Fm-Dap(Fm) molecules through intermolecular aromatic π-π stacking and hydrogen bonding interactions during hydrogelation. Interestingly, Fm-Dap(Fm) not only exhibits hydrogel formation but also shows cell viability and enhanced cell proliferation at physiological pH (7.4). Further, Fm-Dap(Fm) forms a hydrogel upon co-incubation with vitamin B and also exhibits release of vitamin B over a period. The current study thus demonstrates the development of a new hydrogel material, based on LMW gelator containing the non-proteinogenic amino , which can elicit cell viability, enhanced cell proliferation, drug encapsulation, and drug release properties. Hence, Fm-Dap(Fm) hydrogel could be an ideal material for biomedical applications, especially in tissue engineering and drug delivery.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Treatment of oiled sea turtles was guided by expected physiological and pathological effects of crude oil exposure extrapolated from studies in other species and from a single loggerhead sea turtle () study. While invaluable starting points, inherent limitations to extrapolation, and small sample size of the experimental exposure study, reduce their utility for clinical guidance and for assessing oil spill impacts. Effects of dispersants were not included in the previous experimental exposure study, and cannot be effectively isolated in the analysis of field data from actual spills. A terminal study of pivotal temperature of sex determination using eggs salvaged from doomed loggerhead nests provided an opportunity for an ancillary exposure study to investigate the acute effects of crude oil, dispersant, and a crude oil/dispersant combination in sea turtle hatchlings. Eggs were incubated at 27.2-30.8°C, and hatchlings were randomly assigned to control, oil, dispersant, and combined oil/dispersant exposures for 1 or 4 days. Contaminant exposures were started after a 3 day post-hatching period simulating nest emergence. Turtles were placed in individual glass bowls containing aged seawater and exposed to oil (Gulf Coast-Mixed Crude Oil Sweet, CAS #8002-05-9, 0.833 mL/L) and/or dispersant (Corexit 9500A, 0.083 mL/L), replicating concentrations encountered during oil spills and subsequent response. Statistically significant differences between treatments and non-exposed controls were detected for PCV, AST, uric , glucose, calcium, phosphorus, total protein, albumin, globulin, potassium, and sodium. The principal dyscrasias reflected acute osmolar, electrolyte and hydration challenges that were more numerous and greater in combined oil/dispersant exposures at 4 days. Clinicopathological findings were supported by a failure to gain  (associated with normal hatchling hydration in seawater) in dispersant and combination exposed hatchlings. These findings can help guide clinical response for sea turtles exposed to crude oil and crude oil/dispersant combinations, and indicate potential impacts on wildlife to consider when deploying dispersants in an oil spill response.Copyright © 2019 Harms, McClellan-Green, Godfrey, Christiansen, Broadhurst and Godard-Codding.</p></html>
