<html><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31209849>Human Microbiota and Personalized Cancer Treatments: Role of Commensal Microbes in Treatment Outcomes for Cancer Patients.</a></h2><p>The human gut microbiota consists of about 3.8 × 10 microorganisms that play an essential role in health, metabolism, and immunomodulation. These gut microbes alter therapeutic response and toxicity to cancer therapies including cytotoxic chemotherapy, radiation therapy, kinase inhibitors, and immunotherapy agents. The gut microbiota generates short-chain fatty  that are significant regulators of histone post-translational modifications that fundamentally regulate gene expression, linking the microbiota to cellular metabolism and transcriptional regulation. The short-chain fatty  not only act locally but can be taken up in the blood stream to inhibit the activity of histone deacetylases, regulate gene expression in distant organs as well as the effector function of CD8+ T cells. Cancer and the treatments for it negatively impact the microbiome often resulting in . This can diminish a patient's response to treatment as well as increase systemic toxicities from these therapies. In addition to the gut microbiota, microbes have been detected in tumors that can modulate chemotherapeutic drug response and can result in immune suppression. The gut microbiota and tumor-associated bacteria may be a significant contributor to the interindividual differences and heterogeneous responses to cancer therapies and drug tolerability and strategies that support and/or manipulate the microbiota to improve therapeutic outcome is an emerging area for personalized cancer treatment.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31610731>Bone Marrow-Derived Cells Restore Functional Integrity of the Gut Epithelial and Vascular Barriers in a Model of Diabetes and ACE2 Deficiency.</a></h2><p> There is incomplete knowledge of the impact of bone marrow (BM) cells on the gut  and gut barrier function.  We postulated that diabetes and systemic angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) deficiency would synergize to adversely impact both the  and gut barrier function.  Bacterial 16S rRNA sequencing and metatranscriptomic analysis were performed on fecal samples from WT, ACE2, Akita (type 1 diabetic, T1D), and ACE2-Akita mice. Gut barrier integrity was assessed by immunofluorescence, and BM cell extravasation into the small intestine was evaluated by flow cytometry. In the CE2-Akita or Akita mice, the disrupted barrier was associated with reduced levels of myeloid angiogenic cells (MACs), but no increase in inflammatory monocytes was observed within the gut parenchyma. Genomic and metatranscriptomic analysis of the  of ACE2-Akita mice demonstrated a marked increase in peptidoglycan (PGN) producing bacteria. When compared to control cohorts treated with saline, intraperitoneal administration of MACs significantly decreased the  gene expression associated with PGN biosynthesis and restored epithelial and endothelial gut barrier integrity. Also indicative of diabetic gut barrier dysfunction, increased levels of PGN and intestinal fatty  binding protein-2 (FABP-2) were observed in plasma of human subjects with T1D (n=21) and Type 2 diabetes (T2D, n=23) compared to non-diabetic controls (n=23). Using human retinal endothelial cells, we determined that PGN activates a non-canonical Toll-like receptor-2 (TLR2) associated MyD88-ARNO-ARF6 signaling cascade, resulting in destabilization of p120-catenin and internalization of VE-cadherin as a mechanism of deleterious impact of PGN on the endothelium.  We demonstrate for the first time that the defect in gut barrier function and dysbiosis in CE2-Akita mice can be favorably impacted by exogenous administration of MACs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31003502>An In Vitro Study of the Influence of  Extracts on the Microbiota Modulation Process, In Patients with Hypertension.</a></h2><p>The multiple causes of cardiovascular diseases signify a major incidence and developmental risk of this pathology. One of the processes accountable for this pathologic development is the instauration of  and its connection with an inflammatory process. Low antioxidant colonic protection encourages the progression of inflammation, with cardiovascular dysfunctions being a secondary consequence of the . Curcumin is one of the bioactive compounds displaying promising results for the reduction of an inflammatory process. The present study aims at demonstrating the capacity of three extracts drawn from  ()  through an in vitro simulation process, for microbiota modulation in patients with hypertension. The acidic pH in the extraction process determined a high curcumin content in the extracts. The major phenolic compound identified was curcumin III, 622 ± 6.88 µg/mL for the ethanol/water/acetic  extract. Low EC50 values were associated (0.2 µg/mL for DPPH scavenging activity) with the presence of curcumin isomers. A metabolic pattern became evident because the relationship between the short-chain fatty  acted as a clinical biomarker. The curcumin present stimulated the formation of butyric and propionic . Microbiota activity control included a high degree of curcumin degradation and biotransformation in the other phenolic compounds. This developmental process was supported by the progression in the enterobacteria with a corresponding escalation in the pH level. The metabolomic pattern demonstrated a performance similar to the administration of dietary fibre, with the positive effects being dose-dependent.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31174953> of gut microbiota in a selected population of Parkinson's patients.</a></h2><p>In recent years the hypothesis that gut microbiota associates with Parkinson's disease (PD) has gained importance, although it has not been possible to define a specific microbiota composition as a predictive biomarker of this disease. We have investigated  of gut microbiota in a selected population of PD patients from Central Italy, and examined the weight of specific confounders and predictors, in order to identify potential correlations with clinical phenotypes.152 fecal samples were collected from 80 patients and 72 healthy controls. Patients were enrolled according to tight inclusion criteria. Microbiota composition was studied through 16s ribosomal RNA gene amplicon sequencing analysis in combination with data on dietary/life habits. Age, loss of weight, and sex were recognized as confounding factors, whereas PD-status, age, Body Mass Index, "eat cereals", "gain of weigth" and "physical activity" as predictors. The presence of Lactobacillaceae, Enterobacteriaceae and Enterococcaceae families was significantly higher in feces from PD patients compared to healthy controls, while Lachnospiraceae were significantly reduced. Lower levels of Lachnospiraceae and higher levels of Enterobacteriaceae families also correlated with increased disease severity and motor impairment (Hoehn & Yahr stage, MDS-UPDRS Part III). Predictive metagenomics indicated a significant variation of genes involved in the metabolism of short chain fatty  and amino , and in lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis.PD showed a distinctive microbiota composition. Functional predictions suggest changes in pathways favoring a pro-inflammatory environment in the gastrointestinal tract, and a reduction in the biosynthesis of amino  acting as precursors of physiological transmitters.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

T-cell profile analyses were performed by flow cytometry for MS patients and matched controls (n = 12).(1) The gut microbiome of MS patients was characterized by an increase of Streptococcus and a decrease of Prevotella_9; additionally, compared to NMOSD patients, Prevotella_9 was found to be much more abundant in MS patients. (2) A striking depletion of fecal acetate, propionate, and butyrate was observed in MS patients compared to HCs. (3) The abundance of Streptococcus was negatively correlated with the proportion of pTregs (P < 0.05) and positively correlated with Th17 cells (P < 0.05) in the peripheral blood, while the abundance of Prevotella_9 was negatively correlated with the Th17 cell frequency (P < 0.01), and the fecal SCFA level was positively correlated with pTreg frequency (P < 0.05).Gut  and a lack of SCFAs exist in Chinese MS patients, which might be related to an aberrant immune response of MS; this relationship may have a diagnostic and therapeutic value for patients with MS.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, antidiabetic agents, reportedly inhibit the HSC proliferation. Additionally, Takeda G protein-coupled receptor 5 (TGR5) agonists induce the systemic release of glucagon-like peptides from intestinal L cells, which maintains glycemic homeostasis. This study assessed the combined effect of TGR5 agonist and DPP-4 inhibitor on diabetes-based liver fibrosis development. Male diabetic rats received intraperitoneal injection of porcine serum (PS) to induce liver fibrosis, and they were orally administered the following agents: oleanolic  (OA) as a TGR5 agonist, anagliptin (ANA) as a DPP-4 inhibitor, and a combination of both agents. Treatment with OA or ANA significantly improved glycemic status and attenuated intrahepatic steatosis and lipid peroxidation in diabetic rats. PS-induced liver fibrosis development was also drastically suppressed by treatment with either agent, and the combination of both reciprocally enhanced the antifibrotic effect. Fecal  demonstrated that both agents inhibited the increase in the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio, an indicator of dysbiosis related to metabolic syndromes. Furthermore, ANA directly inhibited in vitro HSC proliferative and profibrogenic activities. Collectively, TGR5 agonist and DPP-4 inhibitor appears to be a novel strategy against liver fibrosis under diabetic conditions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31147751>Microbiome-metabolomics reveals gut microbiota associated with glycine-conjugated metabolites and polyamine metabolism in chronic kidney disease.</a></h2><p> of the gut microbiome and related metabolites in chronic kidney disease (CKD) have been intimately associated with the prevalence of cardiovascular diseases. Unfortunately, thus far, there is a paucity of sufficient knowledge of gut microbiome and related metabolites on CKD progression partly due to the severely limited investigations. Using a 5/6 nephrectomized (NX) rat model, we carried out 16S rRNA sequence and untargeted metabolomic analyses to explore the relationship between colon's microbiota and serum metabolites. Marked decline in microbial diversity and richness was accompanied by significant changes in 291 serum metabolites, which were mediated by altered enzymatic activities and dysregulations of lipids, amino , bile  and polyamines metabolisms. Interestingly, CCr was directly associated with some microbial genera and polyamine metabolism. However, SBP was directly related to certain microbial genera and glycine-conjugated metabolites in CKD rats. Administration of poricoic  A (PAA) and Poria cocos (PC) ameliorated microbial  as well as attenuated hypertension and renal fibrosis. In addition, treatments with PAA and PC lowered serum levels of microbial-derived products including glycine-conjugated compounds and polyamine metabolites. Collectively, the present study confirmed the CKD-associated gut microbial  and identified a novel dietary and therapeutic strategy to improve the gut microbial  and the associated metabolomic disorders and retarded the progression of kidney disease in the rat model of CKD.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31332389>Healthspan and lifespan extension by fecal microbiota transplantation into progeroid mice.</a></h2><p>The gut microbiome is emerging as a key regulator of several metabolic, immune and neuroendocrine pathways. Gut microbiome deregulation has been implicated in major conditions such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, non-alcoholic fatty  liver disease and cancer, but its precise role in aging remains to be elucidated. Here, we find that two different mouse models of progeria are characterized by intestinal  with alterations that include an increase in the abundance of Proteobacteria and Cyanobacteria, and a decrease in the abundance of Verrucomicrobia. Consistent with these findings, we found that human progeria patients also display intestinal  and that long-lived humans (that is, centenarians) exhibit a substantial increase in Verrucomicrobia and a reduction in Proteobacteria. Fecal microbiota transplantation from wild-type mice enhanced healthspan and lifespan in both progeroid mouse models, and transplantation with the verrucomicrobia Akkermansia muciniphila was sufficient to exert beneficial effects. Moreover, metabolomic analysis of ileal content points to the restoration of secondary bile  as a possible mechanism for the beneficial effects of reestablishing a healthy microbiome. Our results demonstrate that correction of the accelerated aging-associated intestinal  is beneficial, suggesting the existence of a link between aging and the gut microbiota that provides a rationale for microbiome-based interventions against age-related diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31293553>A Purified Anthraquinone-Glycoside Preparation From Rhubarb Ameliorates Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus by Modulating the Gut Microbiota and Reducing Inflammation.</a></h2><p> L. is widely used in traditional Chinese medicine for the treatment of constipation. Here, the therapeutic effects and underlying mechanisms of purified anthraquinone-glycoside preparation from rhubarb (RAGP) on the type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) rats were investigated. After 6 weeks of metformin and RAGP treatment, the weight returned to normal. Fasting blood glucose (FBG), glycated serum protein (GSP), insulin concentration and HOMA-IR index had significantly decreased, and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) concentrations had increased. Histological abnormalities in the pancreas and ileum had improved. These effects were associated with enhanced intestinal integrity, thereby reducing the absorption of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and inflammation. To investigate whether RAGP ameliorated insulin resistance  effects on the gut microbiota, we performed 16s rDNA sequencing of ileal gut contents. This showed an amelioration of gut , with greater abundance of probiotic  and short-chain fatty -producing bacteria, and lower abundance of the Lachnospiraceae NK4A136 group and LPS-producing . The mechanism of the hypoglycemic effect of RAGP involves regulation of the gut microbiota, activation of the GLP-1/cAMP pathway to ameliorate insulin resistance. Thus, this study provides a theoretical basis for the use of RAGP to treat T2DM, and it may be a novel approach to restore the gut microbiota.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31170664>Candesartan attenuates hypertension-associated pathophysiological alterations in the gut.</a></h2><p>Intestinal pathophysiological alterations have recently been revealed to be implicated in the pathogenesis of hypertension, necessitating further investigations to better understand the intestinal effects of anti-hypertensive drugs. The current study thus investigated the pharmacological implications of a commonly used first-line angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker, candesartan cilexetil, on the intestinal barrier impairment and gut  in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). The results revealed that candesartan treatment protected against ileal and colonic pathologies and increased the intestinal expression of genes encoding tight junction proteins such as cingulin, occludin and tight junction protein 1 in SHRs. Serum level of lipopolysaccharides-binding protein was increased in candesartan-treated SHRs, supporting the notion that candesartan treatment provided protection against hypertension-associated impairment of intestinal barrier. Candesartan treatment also increased the amount of fecal short-chain fatty  (SCFAs) including acetic , propionic , and butyric  in SHRs. Fecal 16S rDNA sequencing further revealed that candesartan treatment normalized hypertension-altered ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes in SHRs. Most notably, candesartan treatment counteracted hypertension-associated diminishment of lactic -producing genus Lactobacillus. Taken together, the current study demonstrates for the first time that candesartan treatment alleviates hypertension-associated pathophysiological alterations in the gut, increases microbial production of SCFAs and preserves gut Lactobacillus under hypertensive conditions, which sheds novel light on the pharmacological implications of candesartan in the treatment of hypertension.Copyright © 2019.

The consequences of intestinal , such as increased intestinal permeability and altered microbial metabolites, are suspected to contribute to the host inflammatory state and peripheral insulin resistance. Human diabetics have been shown to have changes in bile  (BA) metabolism which may be detrimental to glycemic control. The purpose of this study was to examine BA metabolism in dogs with naturally-occurring, insulin-dependent DM and to relate these findings to changes in the intestinal microbiota. A prospective observational study of adult dogs with a clinical diagnosis of DM ( = 10) and healthy controls (HC,  = 10) was performed. The fecal microbiota were analyzed by 16S rRNA gene next-generation (Illumina) sequencing. Concentrations of fecal unconjugated BA (fUBA) were measured using gas chromatography and mass spectrometry. Analysis of bacterial communities showed no significant difference for any of the alpha-diversity measures between DM vs. HC dogs. Principal coordinate analysis based on unweighted Unifrac distance metric failed to show significant clustering between dog groups (ANOSIM:  = 0.084;  = 0.114). However, linear discriminate analysis effects size (LEfSe) detected differentially abundant bacterial taxa (α = 0.01, LDA score >2.0) on various phylogenetic levels. While  was overrepresented in dogs with DM, the proportions of Erysipelotrichia, , and  were increased in HC dogs. Dogs with DM had increased concentration of total primary fUBA compared to HC dogs ( = 0.028). The concentrations of cholic  and the cholic  percentage of the total fUBA were increased ( = 0.028 and  = 0.035, respectively) in the feces of DM dogs relative to HC dogs. The levels of lithocholic  (both absolute value and percentage of the total fUBA) were decreased ( = 0.043 and  < 0.01, respectively) in DM dogs vs. HC dogs. Results indicate that dogs with DM have both intestinal  and associated fUBA alterations. The pattern of  and altered BA composition is similar to that seen in humans with Type 2 DM. The dog represents a novel large animal model for advancing translational medicine research efforts (e.g., investigating pathogenesis and therapeutics) in DM affecting humans.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31488882>Sodium oligomannate therapeutically remodels gut microbiota and suppresses gut bacterial amino -shaped neuroinflammation to inhibit Alzheimer's disease progression.</a></h2><p>Recently, increasing evidence has suggested the association between gut  and Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression, yet the role of gut microbiota in AD pathogenesis remains obscure. Herein, we provide a potential mechanistic link between gut microbiota  and neuroinflammation in AD progression. Using AD mouse models, we discovered that, during AD progression, the alteration of gut microbiota composition leads to the peripheral accumulation of phenylalanine and isoleucine, which stimulates the differentiation and proliferation of pro-inflammatory T helper 1 (Th1) cells. The brain-infiltrated peripheral Th1 immune cells are associated with the M1 microglia activation, contributing to AD-associated neuroinflammation. Importantly, the elevation of phenylalanine and isoleucine concentrations and the increase of Th1 cell frequency in the blood were also observed in two small independent cohorts of patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to AD. Furthermore, GV-971, a sodium oligomannate that has demonstrated solid and consistent cognition improvement in a phase 3 clinical trial in China, suppresses gut  and the associated phenylalanine/isoleucine accumulation, harnesses neuroinflammation and reverses the cognition impairment. Together, our findings highlight the role of gut -promoted neuroinflammation in AD progression and suggest a novel strategy for AD therapy by remodelling the gut microbiota.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31642672>Polyphenol-rich extracts from brown macroalgae Lessonia trabeculate attenuate hyperglycemia and modulate gut microbiota in high fat diet and streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats.</a></h2><p>Brown macroalgae is an important source of polyphenols with multiple health functions. In this work, polyphenol extracts from Lessonia trabeculate were purified and investigated for the anti-diabetic activity in vitro and in vivo. The purified polyphenol extracts exhibited good antioxidant activities, α-glucosidase and lipase inhibition activities ((IC50<0.25 mg/mL). The HPLC-DAD-ESI-MS/MS analysis indicated that the compounds in polyphenol extracts were mainly phlorotannin derivatives, phenolic  derivatives, and gallocatechin derivatives. In vivo, C57BL/6J rats treated with polyphenol extracts for 4 weeks had lower fasting blood glucose (FBG) levels, insulin levels as well as better serum lipid profiles and antioxidant stress parameters, compared with diabetic control (DC) group. Histopathology revealed that polyphenol extracts preserved the architecture and function of liver. Short chain fatty  (SCFAs) contents in rats' fecal samples with polyphenols administration were significantly recovered as compared with DC group. Furthermore, the gut microflora of rats was investigated with high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing and results indicated that polyphenol extracts had a positive effect on regulating the  of the microbial ecology in diabetic rats.

For healthy life expectancy, natural bacteriostatic products are ideal for daily and lifetime use as anti-oral infection agents. This study aimed to evaluate the inhibitory effects of abietic , a diterpene derived from pine rosin, on the in vitro growth of cariogenic bacterial species, Streptococcus mutans. The effective minimum inhibitory concentration of abietic  was determined through observation of S. mutans growth, acidification, and biofilm formation. The inhibitory effects of abietic  on the bacterial membrane were investigated through the use of in situ viability analysis and scanning electron microscopic analysis. Cytotoxicity of abietic  was also examined in the context of several human cell lines using tetrazolium reduction assay. Abietic  was found to inhibit key bacterial growth hallmarks such as colony forming ability, adenosine triphosphate activity (both planktonic and biofilm),  production, and biofilm formation. Abietic  was identified as bacteriostatic, and this compound caused minimal damage to the bacterial membrane. This action was different from that of povidone-iodine or cetylpyridinium chloride. Additionally, abietic  was significantly less cytotoxic compared to povidone-iodine, and it exerted lower toxicity towards epithelial cells and fibroblasts compared to that against monocytic cells. These data suggest that abietic  may prove useful as an antibacterial and antibiofilm agent for controlling S. mutans infection.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31592206>Elemental diet induces alterations of the gut microbial community in mice.</a></h2><p>The aim of the present study was to investigate elemental diet (ED)-induced alteration of the fecal and mucosal  in mice. The control group was fed a normal chow and the ED group was fed normal chow containing 50% w/w Elental (EA Pharma, Tokyo, Japan) for 28 days. Fecal and mucosal  were analyzed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. In the fecal samples, the observed species, an index for microbial richness, was significantly decreased in the ED group. Principal coordinate analysis revealed that there were significant compositional differences between the control and ED groups (PERMANOVA  = 0.0007 for unweighted and  = 0.002 for weighted UniFrac distance, respectively). In contrast, there was no significant difference in the overall structure of mucosal  between the control and ED groups. In the fecal samples, abundance of the genera , , , ,  and  was significantly reduced in the ED group compared to the control group. Abundance of the genera  and  was significantly increased in the ED group. In a functional analysis using PICRUSt software, ED altered various pathways involved in amino  metabolism of the gut .

Ion transport in the neuronal membrane, inhibitory-excitatory mechanisms, and regulatory modulator systems have been implicated in the pathogenesis of epilepsy. A bidirectional communication is proposed between brain and gut where the brain modulates the gastrointestinal tract, and the gut can affect brain function and behavior. The gut microbiome takes an important role in health and disease where  is involved in several neurological disorders. Probiotics as living microorganisms are beneficial to humans and animals when adequately administered. In the present work, we evaluated the effect of a probiotic bacteria mixture on seizure activity, cognitive function, and gamma-aminobutyric  (GABA), nitric oxide (NO), malondealdehyde (MDA), and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) level of the brain tissue in the pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced kindled rats. The Racine score and performance in water maze were considered as indices of the epileptic severity and the spatial learning and memory, respectively. We found that the probiotic supplementation substantially reduces seizure severity so that almost no probiotic-treated animals showed full kindling. The oral bacteriotherapy partially improved the spatial learning and memory in the kindled rats. The intervention decreased NO and MDA and increased TAC concentration of the brain. The probiotic treatment also increased the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA. Our findings are the first preclinical report to show positive effect of probiotic bacteria on seizure-induced neurological disorders. Further investigation is required to answer the questions raised about the probable mechanisms involved.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Applying antibiotics to treat infections is common in clinical practice, which may affect intestinal microbiota. Intestinal microbiota  is involved in the occurrence of some gastrointestinal diseases. Therefore, this study was aimed to investigate the influence of antibiotics on intestinal tight junction barrier and the possible underlying mechanisms. Healthy adult female C57BL/6 mice were treated with a broad-spectrum antibiotic cocktail for 14 days. 16S rDNA Illumina sequencing and headspace gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (HS-GC/MS) were respectively used to analyze microbial community and to detect short-chain fatty  (SCFAs) contents. In vivo intestinal paracellular permeability to fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran (FITC-dextran) was measured. Protein expression was determined by immunoblotting. Immunofluoresence was applied to observe the distributions of ZO-1, LC3B and ASC. Antibiotics remarkably altered intestinal microbiota composition in healthy mice, accompanying reduced SCFAs' concentrations. In addition, the intestinal tight junction barrier was disrupted by antibiotic treatment, as evidenced by increased intestinal paracellular permeability to FITC-dextran, decreased tight junction protein expressions, and disrupted ZO-1 morphology. Furthermore, NLRP3 inflammasome and autophagy were activated by antibiotic treatment. In conclusion, intestinal epithelial tight junction barrier dysfunction induced by antibiotics is associated with intestinal microbiota , activated NLRP3 inflammasome and autophagy in mice.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31472697>Diet-induced remission in chronic enteropathy is associated with altered microbial community structure and synthesis of secondary bile .</a></h2><p>The microbiome has been implicated in the initiation and persistence of inflammatory bowel disease. Despite the fact that diet is one of the most potent modulators of microbiome composition and function and that dietary intervention is the first-line therapy for treating pediatric Crohn's disease, the relationships between diet-induced remission, enteropathy, and microbiome are poorly understood. Here, we leverage a naturally-occurring canine model of chronic inflammatory enteropathy that exhibits robust remission following nutritional therapy, to perform a longitudinal study that integrates clinical monitoring, 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, metagenomic sequencing, metabolomic profiling, and whole genome sequencing to investigate the relationship between therapeutic diet, microbiome, and disease.We show that remission induced by a hydrolyzed protein diet is accompanied by alterations in microbial community structure marked by decreased abundance of pathobionts (e.g., Escherichia coli and Clostridium perfringens), reduced severity of , and increased levels of the secondary bile , lithocholic and deoxycholic . Physiologic levels of these bile  inhibited the growth of E. coli and C. perfringens isolates, in vitro. Metagenomic analysis and whole genome sequencing identified the bile  producer Clostridium hiranonis as elevated after dietary therapy and a likely source of secondary bile  during remission. When C. hiranonis was administered to mice, levels of deoxycholic  were preserved and pathology associated with DSS colitis was ameliorated. Finally, a closely related bile  producer, Clostridium scindens, was associated with diet-induced remission in human pediatric Crohn's disease.These data highlight that remission induced by a hydrolyzed protein diet is associated with improved microbiota structure, an expansion of bile -producing clostridia, and increased levels of secondary bile . Our observations from clinical studies of exclusive enteral nutrition in human Crohn's disease, along with our in vitro inhibition assays and in vivo studies in mice, suggest that this may be a conserved response to diet therapy with the potential to ameliorate disease. These findings provide insight into diet-induced remission of gastrointestinal disease and could help guide the rational design of more effective therapeutic diets.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31146458>Preventive Effects and Mechanisms of Garlic on Dyslipidemia and Gut Microbiome .</a></h2><p>Garlic ( L.) contains prebiotic components, fructans, antibacterial compounds, and organosulfur compounds.

C57BL/6N male mice were fed with or without whole garlic in normal diet (ND) or in high-fat diet (HFD) for 12 weeks. Supplementation with whole garlic attenuated HFD-enhanced ratio of serum GPT/GOT (glutamic-pyruvic transaminase/glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase), levels of T-Cho (total cholesterol) and LDLs (low-density lipoproteins), and index of homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), but had no significant effect in the levels of serum HDL-c (high density lipoprotein cholesterol), TG (total triacylglycerol), and glucose. Moreover, garlic supplementation meliorated the HFD-reduced ratio of villus height/crypt depth, cecum weight, and the concentration of cecal organic . Finally, gut microbiota characterization by high throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed that whole garlic supplementation increased the α-diversity of the gut microbiome, especially increasing the relative abundance of f_ and reducing the relative abundance of g_.

High-fat diet-induced  of gut microbiota and bile  dysregulation may be involved in the pathology of steatosis in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), the most abundant polyphenolic catechin in green tea, has been widely investigated for its inhibitory or preventive effects against fatty liver. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of EGCG on the abundance of gut microbiota and the composition of serum bile  in high-fat diet-fed mice and determine the specific bacterial genera that can improve the serum bile  dysregulation associated with EGCG anti-hepatic steatosis action. Male C57BL/6N mice were fed with the control diet, high-fat diet, or high-fat diet + EGCG at a concentration of 0.32% for 8 weeks. EGCG significantly inhibited the increases in weight, the area of fatty lesions, and the triglyceride content in the liver induced by the high-fat diet. Principal coordinate analysis revealed significant differences in microbial structure among the groups. At the genus level, EGCG induced changes in the microbiota composition in high-fat diet-fed mice, showing a significantly higher abundance of , ,  and a significantly lower abundance of .

He was treated successfully with diet and high-dose biotin along with other nutrient support that resulted in resolution of abnormal sensory behaviors and improvement in language and learning.The child was diagnosed with a presumed biotin deficiency from organic  testing which revealed markers that reflected biotin deficiency despite supplementation with 300 mcg daily (AI = 12 mcg/d). Stool markers were also noted for low beneficial biotin producing microbiota. In the course of several months of high-dose biotin supplementation with herbal treatment for , he was able to subsequently transition from special needs classes requiring sensory support into mainstream classes as a neurotypical child with age appropriate language and learning skills and resolution of abnormal sensory behaviors.This case illustrates the importance of using functional nutrition labs to rule out nutrient imbalances that could be a cause of improper signaling in the brain, which can translate into delayed language, learning, and behavior disorders.

It is usually diagnosed clinically by direct detection of an abnormal pattern of the intestinal microbiota. The intermediate diagnosis based on determining the content of microflora metabolites, considered as chemical markers of this disorder, is still rarely used. This is, among others, due to the variety of properties of compounds recognised as  markers and as a consequence, the use of different methods for their analysis. To the best of our knowledge, there is still no analytical procedure that would allow unambiguous determination of all compounds in one procedure. In the present study, we have established a detailed method for the quantitative analysis of hydrocinnamic, citramalic, p-hydroxybenzeneacetic, tartaric, hippuric, 4-hydroxybenzoic, indoxylsulfuric, tricarballylic, 3,4-dihydroxyhydrocinnamic and benzoic  along with DL-arabitol that employs the direct derivatization of compounds in a small volume of urine sample followed by gas chromatography - tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS).

Intestinal fatty  binding protein (I-FABP) serves as a biomarker of enterocyte damage. The aim of this study was to investigate clinical and metabolic factors affecting plasma concentration of I-FABP in patients with psoriasis. Eighty patients with psoriasis and 40 control subjects were enrolled in the study. Serum I-FABP (243.00 (108.88-787.10) vs. 114.38 (51.60-241.60) pg/ml,  < 0.001) and neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR; 2.59 (1.96-3.09) vs. 1.72 (1.36-47 2.11),  < 0.01) were significantly increased in patients with psoriasis compared to controls. A significant positive correlation was found between I-FABP and body mass index (BMI) ( = 0.82,  < 0.001), Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI) ( = 0.78,  < 0.001) and neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) ( = 0.24,  < 0.001). Rising quartiles of I-FABP were associated with increasing values of BMI, PASI and NLR. The results of the logistic regression model confirmed an increased risk of higher disease severity with I-FABP concentration - odds ratio 3.34 per 100 pg/mL I-FABP increase. In conclusion, intestinal integrity in patients with psoriasis is affected by obesity, severity of the disease and systemic inflammation. The modulation of gut barrier may represent a new therapeutic approach for psoriasis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31650688>Theoretical turnover rate of the rumen liquid fraction in dairy cows and its relationship to feed intake, rumen fermentation, and milk production.</a></h2><p>Ruminant animals are able to convert plant materials (grain and the human-indigestible portion of carbohydrates) to milk and meat. In this conversion, most of the plant materials are digested by rumen fermentation and are changed to short-chain fatty , microbial cells, and methane, which is released into the atmosphere. The relationships among feed, rumen fermentation, and milk production are poorly understood. Here we report a novel indicator of characteristics of rumen fermentation, theoretical turnover rate (TTOR) of the rumen liquid fraction. The TTOR was calculated from the presumed rumen volume (PRV) which is estimated by dividing the methane yield by the methane concentration of rumen fluid. The formula for the TTOR is: TTOR = PRV/body weight . Our present analyses confirm that the TTOR as an indicator is capable of connecting feed, rumen fermentation, and milk production, because dry matter intake/TTOR showed a strong correlation with milk yield/TTOR. In addition, the TTOR may be related to ruminal pH, as we observed that the ruminal pH decreased as the TTOR increased. We propose that the TTOR is a factor characterizing rumen fermentation and a good indicator of the productivity of ruminants and  of the rumen microbiome.© 2019 Japanese Society of Animal Science.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31426765>Change of intestinal microbiota in cerebral ischemic stroke patients.</a></h2><p>Gut microbiota has been suggested to play a role in stroke patients.

The goal of this review is to take a broad perspective on the clinical problem of colorectal neoplasia in the liver disease population, recognize the significance of the clinical study findings, and delve into the evidence supporting putative molecular mechanisms connecting  in the progression of liver disease to the development of colorectal neoplasia.Clinical studies have recently reported increased risk of colorectal neoplasia in patients with fatty liver disease, and risk increases with liver disease severity. Concurrently, the evolution of -omics technology has shown dysregulation of the gut microbial community, termed , in the progression of liver disease. Specific microbes enriched in the gut flora of liver disease patients have been linked to colon cancer and adenomatous precursor lesions. The gut microbiome of liver disease patients generates a pro-neoplastic environment, mediated via altered bile  signaling and a dysregulated inflammatory response that suppresses immune surveillance. Research focused on the mechanisms linking liver disease to colorectal neoplasia via the gut microbiome is needed to help us prepare for the rising tide of colon cancer in young patients with an increasing prevalence of liver disease.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31370220>Gut  and the Intestinal Microbiome:  a Key Probiotic for Reducing Uremia.</a></h2><p>In the intestines, probiotics can produce antagonistic effects such as antibiotic-like compounds, bactericidal proteins such as bacteriocins, and encourage the production of metabolic end products that may assist in preventing infections from various pathobionts (capable of pathogenic activity) microbes. Metabolites produced by intestinal bacteria and the adoptions of molecular methods to cross-examine and describe the human microbiome have refreshed interest in the discipline of nephology. As such, the adjunctive administration of probiotics for the treatment of chronic kidney disease (CKD) posits that certain probiotic bacteria can reduce the intestinal burden of uremic toxins. Uremic toxins eventuate from the over manifestation of glucotoxicity and lipotoxicity, increased activity of the hexosamine and polyol biochemical and synthetic pathways. The accumulation of advanced glycation end products that have been regularly associated with a dysbiotic colonic microbiome drives the overproduction of uremic toxins in the colon and the consequent local pro-inflammatory processes.

Although antineoplastic cytotoxicity constitutes the primary injury trigger, the interaction of oral microbial commensals with mucosal tissues could modify the response. It is not clear, however, whether chemotherapy and its associated treatments affect oral microbial communities disrupting the homeostatic balance between resident microorganisms and the adjacent mucosa and if such alterations are associated with mucositis. To gain knowledge on the pathophysiology of oral mucositis, 49 subjects receiving 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) or doxorubicin-based chemotherapy were evaluated longitudinally during one cycle, assessing clinical outcomes, bacterial and fungal oral microbiome changes, and epithelial transcriptome responses. As a control for microbiome stability, 30 non-cancer subjects were longitudinally assessed. Through complementary in vitro assays, we also evaluated the antibacterial potential of 5-FU on oral microorganisms and the interaction of commensals with oral epithelial tissues.Oral mucositis severity was associated with 5-FU, increased salivary flow, and higher oral granulocyte counts. The oral bacteriome was disrupted during chemotherapy and while antibiotic and  inhibitor intake contributed to these changes, bacteriome disruptions were also correlated with antineoplastics and independently and strongly associated with oral mucositis severity. Mucositis-associated bacteriome shifts included depletion of common health-associated commensals from the genera Streptococcus, Actinomyces, Gemella, Granulicatella, and Veillonella and enrichment of Gram-negative bacteria such as Fusobacterium nucleatum and Prevotella oris. Shifts could not be explained by a direct antibacterial effect of 5-FU, but rather resembled the inflammation-associated dysbiotic shifts seen in other oral conditions. Epithelial transcriptional responses during chemotherapy included upregulation of genes involved in innate immunity and apoptosis. Using a multilayer epithelial construct, we show mucositis-associated dysbiotic shifts may contribute to aggravate mucosal damage since the mucositis-depleted Streptococcus salivarius was tolerated as a commensal, while the mucositis-enriched F. nucleatum displayed pro-inflammatory and pro-apoptotic capacity.Altogether, our work reveals that chemotherapy-induced oral mucositis is associated with bacterial  and demonstrates the potential for dysbiotic shifts to aggravate antineoplastic-induced epithelial injury. These findings suggest that control of oral bacterial  could represent a novel preventive approach to ameliorate oral mucositis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31311146>Altered in Vitro Metabolomic Response of the Human Microbiota to Sweeteners.</a></h2><p>Non-nutritive sweeteners represent an ingredient class that directly affects human health, via the development of inflammatory processes that promote chronic diseases related to microbiota . Several in vitro tests were conducted in the static GIS1 simulator.

The immediate effect of the in vitro treatment and the influence of the specific sweetener type on the occurrence of  were evaluated by determining the biomarkers of the microbiota response. The presence of the steviol reduced the ammonium level (minimum of 410 mg/L), while the addition of cyclamate and saccharin caused a decrease in the number of microorganisms, in addition to lowering the total quantity of synthesized short-chain fatty  (SCFAs). The bifidobacteria appeared to decrease below 10 genomes/mL in all the analyzed samples at the end of the in vitro simulation period.

Mannose oligosaccharide (MOS) has been reported to be a potential prebiotic. The present study is aimed to determine the effects of MOS on western-diet-induced obesity and to uncover the mediating roles of the gut microbiota and microbial metabolites.Three-month-old male ICR mice are fed with a high-fat and high-fructose diet for 8 weeks. The diet-induced obese mice are then orally administrated with MOS (100 and 200 mg kg  d ) for 4 weeks. MOS significantly reduces bodyweight gain, insulin resistance, fatty liver, and inflammatory responses in obese mice. MOS also stimulates lipolysis and inhibits lipogenesis in the adipose tissues. Moreover, MOS restructures the gut microbiome by enhancing the abundance of Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus in obese mice. The microbial metabolite SCFAs are also increased in the feces and serum. Correlation analysis indicates that the appetite suppression and lipid-lowering effects of MOS are highly correlated with the butyrate levels.MOS suppresses the appetite, which results in less lipid deposition. The lower appetite is likely due to an altered gut microbiome and elevated SCFAs production. MOS may be a potential nutraceutical used in body weight management and gut health improvement.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

However, the specific interplay between KYDS and intestinal microbiota, and the intrinsic regulation mechanism of You-gui pill (YGP) on KYDS' gut microbiota remains largely unknown so far.In the present study, fecal metabonomics combined with 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis were used to explore the mutual effect between KYDS and intestinal flora, and the intrinsic regulation mechanism of YGP on KYDS's gut microbiota. Rats' feces from control (CON) group, KYDS group and YGP group were collected, and metabolomic analysis was performed using H NMR technique combined with multivariate statistical analysis to obtain differential metabolites. Simultaneously, 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis based on the Illumina HiSeq sequencing platform and ANOVA analysis were used to analyze the composition of the intestinal microbiota in the stool samples and to screen for the significant altered microbiota at the genus level. After that, MetaboAnalyst database and PICRUSt software were apply to conduct metabolic pathway analysis and functional prediction analysis of the screened differential metabolites and intestinal microbiota, respectively. What's more, Pearson correlation analysis was performed on these differential metabolites and gut microbiota.Using fecal metabonomics, KYDS was found to be associated with 21 differential metabolites and seven potential metabolic pathways. These metabolites and metabolic pathways were mainly involved in amino  metabolism, energy metabolism, methylamine metabolism, bile  metabolism and urea cycle, and short-chain fatty  metabolism. Through 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis, we found that KYDS was related to eleven different intestinal microbiotas. These gut microbiota were mostly involved in amino  metabolism, energy metabolism, nervous, endocrine, immune and digestive system, lipid metabolism, and carbohydrate metabolism. Combined fecal metabonomics and 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis, we further discovered that KYDS was primarily linked to three gut microbiotas (i.e. Bacteroides, Desulfovibrio and [Eubacterium]_coprostanoligenes_group) and eleven related metabolites (i.e. deoxycholate, n-butyrate, valine, isoleucine, acetate, taurine, glycine, α-gluconse, β-glucose, glycerol and tryptophan) mediated various metabolic disorders (amino  metabolism, energy metabolism, especially methylamine metabolism, bile  metabolism and urea cycle, short-chain fatty  metabolism. nervous, endocrine, immune and digestive system, lipid metabolism, and carbohydrate metabolism). YGP, however, had the ability to mediate four kinds of microbes (i.e. Ruminiclostridium_9, Ruminococcaceae_UCG-007, Ruminococcaceae_UCG-010, and uncultured_bacterium_f_Bacteroidales_S24-7_group) and ten related metabolites (i.e. deoxycholate, valine, isoleucine, alanine, citrulline, acetate, DMA, TMA, phenylalanine and tryptophan) mediated amino  metabolism, especially methylamine metabolism, bile  metabolism and urea cycle, short-chain fatty  metabolism, endocrine, immune and digestive system, and lipid metabolism, thereby exerting a therapeutic effect on KYDS rats.Overall, our findings have preliminary confirmed that KYDS is closely related to metabolic and microbial , whereas YGP can improve the metabolic disorder of KYDS by acting on intestinal microbiota. Meanwhile, this will lay the foundation for the further KYDS's metagenomic research and the use of intestinal microbiotas as drug targets to treat KYDS.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The current study aimed to investigate the efficacy of supplementing a novel specific low-methoxyl pectin (LMP) dietary fiber in preventing T1D development. Female NOD mice were weaned onto control or 5% (wt/wt) LMP supplemented diets for up to 40 weeks of age, overt diabetes incidence and blood glucose were monitored. Then broad-spectrum antibiotics (ABX) treatment per os for 7 days followed by gut microbiota transfer was performed to demonstrate gut microbiota-dependent effects. Next-generation sequencing was used for analyzing the composition of microbiota in caecum. Concentration of short chain fatty  were determined by GC-MS. The barrier reinforcing tight junction proteins zonula occludens-2 (ZO-2), claudin-1 and NOD like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activation were determined by Western blot. The proportion of CD25Foxp3CD4 regulatory T cell (Foxp3 Treg) in the pancreas, pancreatic and mesenteric lymph nodes was analyzed by flow cytometry. We found that LMP supplementation ameliorated T1D development in non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice, as evidenced by decreasing diabetes incidence and fasting glucose levels in LMP fed NOD mice. Further microbiota analysis revealed that LMP supplementation prevented T1D-associated caecal  and selectively enriched caecal bacterial species to produce more SCFAs. The LMP-mediated microbial balance further enhanced caecal barrier function and shaped gut-pancreatic immune environment, as characterized by higher expression of tight junction proteins claudin-1, ZO-2 in caecum, increased Foxp3 Treg population and decreased NLRP3 inflammasome activation in both caecum and pancreas. The microbiota-dependent beneficial effect of LMP on T1D was further proven by the fact that aberration of caecal microbiota by ABX treatment worsened T1D autoimmunity and could be restored with transfer of feces of LMP-fed NOD mice. These data demonstrate that this novel LMP limits T1D development by inducing caecal homeostasis to shape pancreatic immune environment. This finding opens a realistic option for gut microbiota manipulation and prevention of T1D in humans.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661720>Changes of gut microbiota during silybin mediated treatment of high-fat diet-induced nonalcoholic fatty liver diseasein mouse.</a></h2><p>Gut microbiota involved in pathogenesis of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).

Although epidemiological studies of salivary microbiota in carcinogenesis are mounting, no systemic study exists regarding the oral microbiota of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. In this study, we presented the characteristics of the salivary microbiota in patients from NSCLC and healthy controls by sequencing of the 16S rRNA microbial genes. Our result revealed distinct salivary microbiota composition in patients from NSCLC compared to the healthy controls. As principal co-ordinates analysis (PCoA) showed, saliva samples clearly differed between the two groups, considering the weighted ( = 0.001, R = 0.17), and unweighted ( = 0.001, R = 0.25) UniFrac distance.

Total Clematis triterpenoid saponins (CTSs) prepared from Clematis mandshurica Rupr. possess therapeutic benefits for arthritic diseases. However, the poor pharmacokinetic properties of CTSs have obstructed the translation of these natural agents to drugs. Here, we examined the effects of CTSs on arthritis symptoms, gut microbiota and SCFAs in rats with collagen-induced arthritis (CIA). Our results showed that the arthritis index scores of CIA rats treated with CTSs were significantly lower than those of the model group. Most importantly, CTSs moderated gut microbial  and significantly downregulated the total SCFA concentration in CIA rats. Compared to the control group, CTSs treatment have no significant side effects on the gut microbiota and SCFA metabolism in normal rats. Two differential analyses (LEfSe and DESeq2) were combined to study the details of the changes in gut microbiome, and twenty-four marker taxa at the genus level were identified via a comparison among control, model and CIA rats treated with high doses of CTSs. In particular, the mostly significantly increased gram-negative (G) and decreased gram-positive (G) genera in CIA rats were well restored by CTSs.

The lactic  bacteria (LAB) present in food enhance the digestibility of proteins, moderate the release of fatty , and support human health through inhabiting the gastrointestinal tract. These desirable properties of LAB are attributed, in part, to their metabolic processes involving enzymes such as lipases, proteases, and antibacterial proteins. The LAB strains presenting higher enzymatic activities may offer improved functionality for applications in foods. The first aim of this work was to isolate and identify LAB from diverse dairy products and select those with enhanced enzymatic activities. Secondly, this work aimed to investigate the subcellular organization and identity of these enzymes after semi-purification. Out of the total 137 LAB strains isolated and screened, 50.3% and 61.3% of the strains exhibited lipolytic and proteolytic activities, respectively. Seven strains displaying high enzymatic activities were selected and further characterized for the cellular organization of their lipases, proteases, and antibacterial proteins. The lipolytic and proteolytic activities were exhibited predominantly in the extracellular fraction; whereas, the antibacterial activities were found in various cellular fractions and were capable of inhibiting common undesirable microorganisms in foods. In total, two lipases, seven proteases, and three antibacterial proteins were identified by LC-MS/MS. Characterization of LAB strains with high enzymatic activity has potential biotechnological significance in fermentative processes and in human health as they may improve the physicochemical characteristics of foods and displace strains with weaker enzymatic activities in the human gut microbiota.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31073553>Modulation of gut microbiota by chlorogenic  pretreatment on rats with adrenocorticotropic hormone induced depression-like behavior.</a></h2><p>Gut microbiota  has been implicated as a vital element in the development or exacerbation of mental disorders, such as major depressive disorder (MDD). Based on the current interest in the gut-brain axis, we investigate the effects of chlorogenic  (CGA) on gut microbiota in a rat model of MDD. Depression was induced by the adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH, 100 μg per rat) in male Wistar rats, which were intervened with using saline or CGA (500 mg kg-1). Behavioral changes and serum parameters were assessed and fecal samples were analyzed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Our studies demonstrated that CGA pretreatment ameliorated depression-like behavior (SPT, FST, TST, and OFT) and serum biochemical levels (5-HT, DA, IL-6, and TNF-α) in ACTH-induced depression rats. In addition, CGA ameliorated the decrease in fecal microbiota diversity in ACTH-treated rats. In particular, at the genus level, the changes in the relative abundance of some key bacteria such as Desulfovibrionales, Desulfovibrio, Klebsiella, Burkholderiales, and Bifidobacterium were modulated by CGA pretreatment. These results indicated that CGA could modify the gut microbial community structure, which may contribute to its antidepressant effects.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31565850>Taraxacum officinale extract ameliorates dextran sodium sulphate-induced colitis by regulating fatty  degradation and microbial dysbiosis.</a></h2><p>Numerous data show that taraxacum officinale extract (TOE) exerts protective effects on inflammatory diseases. However, the underlying mechanisms by which TOE affects dextran sulphate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis remain unclear. After DSS-induced colitis were treated with different concentrations of TOE for 8 days, the bodyweight, disease activity index (DAI), colon lengths and pathological scoring were assessed, and histopathological examination was confirmed by HE staining. Furthermore, a transcriptome sequencing was performed by using the colon tissues between TOE and DSS groups, and the differentially expressed genes were conducted for the Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) and were validated by qRT-PCR and immunohistochemistry analysis. In addition, a 16S rDNA sequencing was carried out to distinguish the differential gut  by using the mouse faecal samples between TOE and DSS groups. We found that TOE attenuated the clinical symptoms, lowered the inflammatory scoring and inhibited the secretion of proinflammatory factors TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 in DSS-induced colitis. KEGG and GSEA analysis demonstrated that fatty  degradation and cytokine-receptor signalling were predominantly enriched in TOE-treated colitis as compared with the DSS group. Further investigations revealed that TOE increased the expression levels of Adh5, Aldh3a2 and Acox3, but decreased those of CCL20, CCR6 and CXCL1/5 in DSS-induced colitis, where TOE also induced the enrichment of S24-7 and adlercreutzia, but decreased the amount of anaerostipes, enterococcus, enterobacteriaceae and peptostreptococcaceae. In conclusion, TOE ameliorated DSS-induced colitis by regulating fatty  degradation and microbial dysbiosis.© 2019 The Authors.

Short-chain fatty  (SCFAs) account for physiological interactions between the gut microbiota and host. Our aim was to assess the impact of cirrhotic  on the production of SCFAs.Seventeen patients with cirrhosis and 17 controls were selected. Microbiota composition in faecal samples was assessed by next-generation 16S rRNA gene sequencing. SCFAs were measured with GC-MS in faecal samples and after in vitro batch fermentations using arabinoxylan, resistant starch, pectin, and lactulose as substrates.Among the 17 cirrhotic patients (mean age 58, eight males), six, nine and two were, respectively, Child-Pugh class A, B and C. Eleven patients were on oral antibiotics, 11 on lactulose and 13 on proton pump inhibitors. Cirrhotic patients showed marked differences in the composition and diversity of gut microbiome when compared to controls, that were more pronounced with increased severity. Stool samples from cirrhotic patients showed lower SCFAs content and reduced capacity to produce SCFAs in batch fermentations, with butyrate production being the most abnormal. These functional aberrancies were more pronounced with greater liver disease severity. Abundance of Ruminococcus faecis (in family Ruminococcaceae), Faecalicatena fissicatena and Fusicatenibacter saccharivorans (in family Lachnospiraceae) was positively correlated with the SCFAs production.Cirrhotic  is associated with a decreased capacity to ferment non-digestible carbohydrates into SCFAs, especially into butyrate. These functional abnormalities are more pronounced as disease progresses. These results might inform the design of gut-targeted therapies for cirrhosis.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Our previous study shows that dietary β-hydroxy-β-methylbutyrate (HMB) improves lipid metabolism in a pig model. However, it remains unclear whether HMB blocks obesity through gut microbiota. In this study, we found that HMB reduced body weight, alleviated the whitening of brown adipose tissue, and improved insulin resistance in mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD). High-throughput pyrosequencing of the 16S rRNA demonstrated that HMB administration significantly reversed the gut microbiota  in HFD-fed mice, including the diversity of gut microbiota and relative abundances of  and . Moreover, microbiota transplantation from HMB-treated mice attenuated HFD-induced lipid metabolic disorders. Furthermore, HFD-fed mice showed lower short-chain fatty , whereas administration of HMB increased the propionic  production. Correlation analysis identified a significant correlation between propionic  production and the relative  abundance. Sodium propionate treatment also attenuated HFD-induced lipid metabolic disorders. Collectively, our results indicated that HMB might be used as a probiotic agent to reverse HFD-induced obesity, and the potential mechanism was associated with reprogramming gut microbiota and metabolism, especially -mediated propionic  production. In future studies, more efforts should be made to confirm and expand the beneficial effects of HMB to human models.-Duan, Y., Zhong, Y., Xiao, H., Zheng, C., Song, B., Wang, W., Guo, Q., Li, Y., Han, H., Gao, J., Xu, K., Li, T., Yin, Y., Li, F., Yin, J., Kong, X.

The aim of this work is to investigate the mechanisms of LAPB in ameliorating food allergy-induced intestinal mucosal disorders and to investigate whether or not these disorders occur by the regulation of gut microbiota and metabolism.A TM allergy BALB/c mouse model was established, and two LAPB strains, Bifidobacterium longum (Bi) and Bacillus coagulans (Bc), were used for oral treatment in sensitized mice. The allergic mucosal disorders were assessed by histological analysis and ELISAs. Additionally, microbiota and metabolic modifications were determined by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and GC-TOF-MS, respectively.YSPB administration suppressed TM-induced intestinal mucosal disorders, restored allergenic Th2 cell over-polarization and , and regulated gut arginine and proline metabolism pathways. Statistical analysis suggested the metabolites aspartate and arginine, as well as several commensal flora groups, to be the critical mediators in the process.These data demonstrated the correlation between allergic mucosal disorder, T cell subtype differentiation, gut microbiota composition and intestinal metabolism especially the arginine and proline metabolism pathways. We also revealed the significant effects of LAPB in ameliorating food allergy and maintaining the mucosal ecosystem. This study confirmed the efficiency of LAPB in relieving food allergy, provided Bi and Bc as the potential treatment approaches, and suggested amino  metabolism pathways might be the novel targets for potential clinical applications.Copyright © 2019 Japanese Society of Allergology.

To date, there are no studies on the systemic patterns of BAs in the serum, liver, and gut in the same non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) model.A targeted metabolomics approach and 16S rRNA sequencing were used to identify the profile of BAs and connection between BAs and microbiota. The role and mechanism of altered BAs on hepatic steatosis were investigated.In the liver, the composition of taurocholic  (TCA) was increased, but taurohyodeoxycholic  (THDCA) and ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA) were decreased. In the gut, the deconjugated form of TCA (cholic  (CA)) was increased, while the deconjugated forms of THDCA (α-hyodeoxycholic  (HDCA)) and ω-muricholic  (ωMCA) were decreased. In the serum, the composition of TCA was increased, while both HDCA and THDCA were decreased. THDCA induced the gene expression of apolipoprotein, bile secretion-related proteins, and cytochrome P450 family but suppressed inflammatory response genes expression in steatotic hepatocytes by RNAseq analysis. THDCA ameliorated neutral lipid accumulation and improved insulin sensitivity in primary rat hepatocytes. The decreased HDCA level correlated with the level of Bacteroidetes, while the level of CA correlated with the levels of Firmicutes and Verrucomicrobia but correlated inversely with Bacteroidetes.BAs profiles in the serum, liver and caecal content were altered in a rat NAFLD model, which may affect hepatic lipid accumulation and correlate with gut .Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

However, an increasing number of studies have recently authenticated its biotoxicological effects. In this study, for evaluating the gut toxicity of F-53B in mammals, both female and male mice were orally exposed to 0, 1, 3, or 10 μg/L F-53B for 10 weeks. Our results showed that F-53B significantly accumulated in the colon, ileum and serum when exposed to 10 μg/L F-53B for 10 weeks. F-53B exposure not only increased the transcriptional levels of ion transport-related genes but could also interact with the CFTR protein directly. Interestingly, subchronic F-53B exposure also increased the transcription of mucus secretion-related genes, but the protein level of Muc2 decreased after F-53B exposure, indicating that there was a compensatory phenomenon after mucus barrier injury. Furthermore, F-53B exposure also induced colonic inflammation associated with gut microbiota  in the colon. Taken together, our results indicated that the potential gut toxicity of F-53B and almost all of the changed parameters were significantly affected in both female and male mice, suggesting that F-53B could disturb the gut barrier without sex dependence in mice.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Recent evidence suggests that intestinal mucosal barrier damage and intestinal  occur in mice with hepatic fibrosis induced by CCl4 or bile duct ligation. Another study showed that ursolic  (UA) attenuates experimental colitis via its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities. The goal of this study was to investigate the effects of UA on the intestinal mucosal barrier in CCl4-induced hepatic fibrosis in rats and identify its associated mechanisms. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into the following 3 groups ( = 10/group): the control, CCl4 model and UA treatment groups. Rats were sacrificed at 72 h after the hepatic fibrosis model was established and assessed for liver fibrosis, intestinal injury, enterocyte apoptosis, bacterial translocation, system inflammation, intestinal oxidative stress, and tight junction protein and NOX protein expression. The results demonstrated that UA attenuated the following: (i) liver and intestinal pathological injury; (ii) cleaved caspase-3 expression in the ileal epithelial cells; (iii) serum lipopolysaccharide and procalcitonin levels; (iv) intestinal malondialdehyde levels; and (v) the expression of the NOX protein components NOX2 and P67phox in ileal tissues. Furthermore, our results suggested that UA improved intestinal  and the expression of the tight junction proteins Claudin 1 and Occludin in the ileum of rats. These results indicate that UA has protective effects on the intestinal mucosal barrier in rats with CCl4-induced liver fibrosis by inhibiting intestinal NOX-mediated oxidative stress.

However, BBR has also been reported to cause diarrhea in clinic, with underlying mechanisms poorly understood. Because altered gut microbial ecology is a potential basis for diarrhea, this study was conducted to investigate the impact of BBR on gut microbiota of treatment-emergent diarrhea. BBR treatment (200 mg/kg, i.g.) in normal rats exhibited no significant changes in serum biochemical parameters but mild diarrhea occurred, accompanied with the decreased gastrointestinal transit time and increased fecal moisture, suggestive of the local effects of BBR in the intestine. Colon histology revealed the decreased abundance of mucus-filled goblet cells in BBR group. Although BBR-treated rats had the enlarged cecum with watery caecal digesta, short-chain fatty  concentration was significantly lower than control group. Additionally, BBR caused gut microbiota  by evaluating the decreased observed species number and Shannon index. BBR increased the relative abundances of families Porphyromonadaceae and Prevotellaceae as well as genera Parabacteroides, Prevotellaceae_UCG-001 and Prevotellaceae_NK3B31_group. Spearman's correlation analysis revealed family Prevotellaceae and genus Prevotellaceae_UCG-001 as the most prominent drivers of the BBR treatment-emergent diarrhea, correlating positively with fecal moisture but negatively with gastrointestinal transit time. This study therefore demonstrated that the treatment-emergent mild diarrhea of BBR was most likely due to the  of the gut microbiota.Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS..

To achieve this objective, overlapping actions of complex cellular processes, such as migration, proliferation, and differentiation, are required. These events are longitudinally and tightly controlled by numerous factors including a wide range of distinct regulatory proteins. However, the sequence of events associated with colon mucosal repair after colitis and the evolution of the luminal content characteristics during this process have been little studied.To document the evolution of colon mucosal characteristics during mucosal healing using a mouse model with chemically-induced colitis.C57BL/6 male mice were given 3.5% dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) in drinking water for 5 d. They were euthanized 2 (day 7), 5 (day 10), 8 (day 13), and 23 (day 28) d after DSS removal. The colonic luminal environment and epithelial repair processes during the inflammatory flare and colitis resolution were analyzed with reference to a non-DSS treated control group, euthanized at day 0. Epithelial repair events were assessed histo-morphologically in combination with functional permeability tests, expression of key inflammatory and repairing factors, and evaluation of colon mucosa-adherent microbiota composition by 16S rRNA sequencing.The maximal intensity of colitis was concomitant with maximal alterations of intestinal barrier function and histological damage associated with goblet cell depletion in colon mucosa. It was recorded 2 d after termination of the DSS-treatment, followed by a progressive return to values similar to those of control mice. Although signs of colitis were severe (inflammatory cell infiltrate, crypt disarray, increased permeability) and associated with colonic luminal alterations (hyperosmolarity, , decrease in short-chain fatty  content), epithelial healing processes were launched early during the inflammatory flare with increased gene expression of certain key epithelial repair modulators, including transforming growth factor-β, interleukin (Il)-15, Il-22, Il-33, and serum amyloid A. Whereas signs of inflammation progressively diminished, luminal colonic environment alterations and microscopic abnormalities of colon mucosa persisted long after colitis induction.This study shows that colon repair can be initiated in the context of inflamed mucosa associated with alterations of the luminal environment and highlights the longitudinal involvement of key modulators.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31039010>Gut bacteria are critical for optimal muscle function: a potential link with glucose homeostasis.</a></h2><p>Gut microbiota is involved in the development of several chronic diseases, including diabetes, obesity, and cancer, through its interactions with the host organs. It has been suggested that the cross talk between gut microbiota and skeletal muscle plays a role in different pathological conditions, such as intestinal chronic inflammation and cachexia. However, it remains unclear whether gut microbiota directly influences skeletal muscle function. In this work, we studied the impact of gut microbiota modulation on mice skeletal muscle function and investigated the underlying mechanisms. We determined the consequences of gut microbiota depletion after treatment with a mixture of a broad spectrum of antibiotics for 21 days and after 10 days of natural reseeding. We found that, in gut microbiota-depleted mice, running endurance was decreased, as well as the extensor digitorum longus muscle fatigue index in an ex vivo contractile test. Importantly, the muscle endurance capacity was efficiently normalized by natural reseeding. These endurance changes were not related to variation in muscle mass, fiber typology, or mitochondrial function. However, several pertinent glucose metabolism markers, such as ileum gene expression of short fatty  chain and glucose transporters G protein-coupled receptor 41 and sodium-glucose cotransporter 1 and muscle glycogen level, paralleled the muscle endurance changes observed after treatment with antibiotics for 21 days and reseeding. Because glycogen is a key energetic substrate for prolonged exercise, modulating its muscle availability via gut microbiota represents one potent mechanism that can contribute to the gut microbiota-skeletal muscle axis. Taken together, our results strongly support the hypothesis that gut bacteria are required for host optimal skeletal muscle function.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31168539>Modulating effects of polysaccharides from the fruits of Lycium barbarum on the immune response and gut microbiota in cyclophosphamide-treated mice.</a></h2><p>In the present study, the effects of Lycium barbarum polysaccharides (LBPS) on immunoregulation and gut microbiota  in cyclophosphamide (CTX)-induced mice were investigated to elucidate whether the attenuation of immunosuppression is related to the modulation of the gut microbiota. The results showed that administration of LBPS could protect immune organs (enhancing immune organ indexes and alleviating immune organ damage), enhance the production of immune-related cytokines (IL-2, IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α and IFN-γ) and prevent the hepatotoxicity in CTX-induced mice. Additionally, LBPS treatment could promote the production of short-chain fatty  and modulate the composition of the gut microbiota, increasing the relative abundances of Bacteroidaceae, Lactobacillaceae, Prevotellaceae and Verrucomicrobiaceae, which were positively associated with immune traits.

For such critical use, these bacteria must be correctly identified and characterized to ensure their safety and efficiency. Recently, probiotics have become highly recognized as supplements for humans and in particular for animals because of their beneficial outcome on health improvement and well-being maintenance. Various factors, encompassing dietary and management constraints, have been demonstrated to tremendously influence the structure, composition, and activities of gut microbial communities in farm animals. Previous investigations reported the potential of probiotics in animal diets and nutrition. But a high rate of inconsistency in the efficiency of probiotics has been reported.

However, knowledge of the impact that infections by GI helminths exert on the developing microbiota of juvenile hosts is, thus far, limited. This study investigates, for the first time, the associations between acute infections by GI helminths and the faecal microbial and metabolic profiles of a cohort of equine youngstock, prior to and following treatment with parasiticides (ivermectin). We observed that high versus low parasite burdens (measured via parasite egg counts in faecal samples) were associated with specific compositional alterations of the developing microbiome; in particular, the faecal microbiota of animals with heavy worm infection burdens was characterised by lower microbial richness, and alterations to the relative abundances of bacterial taxa with immune-modulatory functions. Amino  and glucose were increased in faecal samples from the same cohort, which indicated the likely occurrence of intestinal malabsorption. These data support the hypothesis that GI helminth infections in young livestock are associated with significant alterations to the GI microbiota, which may impact on both metabolism and development of acquired immunity. This knowledge will direct future studies aimed to identify the long-term impact of infection-induced alterations of the GI microbiota in young livestock.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31167346>Vegetable-Based Diets for Chronic Kidney Disease?

However, this paradigm is rapidly changing due to the multiple benefits derived from a fundamentally vegetarian diet such as, improvement in gut , reducing the number of pathobionts and protein-fermenting species leading to a decreased production of the most harmful uremic toxins, while the high fiber content of these diets enhances intestinal motility and short-chain fatty  production. Metabolic acidosis in chronic kidney disease (CKD) is aggravated by the high consumption of meat and refined cereals, increasing the dietary  load, while the intake of fruit and vegetables is able to neutralize the acidosis and its deleterious consequences. Phosphorus absorption and bioavailability is also lower in a vegetarian diet, reducing hyperphosphatemia, a known cause of cardiovascular mortality in CKD. The richness of multiple plants in magnesium and vitamin K avoids their deficiency, which is common in these patients. These beneficial effects, together with the reduction of inflammation and oxidative stress observed with these diets, may explain the reduction in renal patients' complications and mortality, and may slow CKD progression. Finally, although hyperkalemia is the main concern of these diets, the use of adequate cooking techniques can minimize the amount absorbed.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30957301>Longitudinal assessment of microbial , fecal unconjugated bile  concentrations, and disease activity in dogs with steroid-responsive chronic inflammatory enteropathy.</a></h2><p>Mounting evidence from human studies suggests that bile  dysmetabolism might play a role in various human chronic gastrointestinal diseases.

This was a multi-institutional study where dogs with steroid-responsive CE were evaluated over time.The  index was increased in dogs with CE (median, 2.5; range, -6.2 to 6.5) at baseline compared with healthy dogs (median, -4.5; range, -6.5 to -2.6; P = .002) but did not change in dogs with CE over time. Secondary fUBA were decreased in dogs with CE (median, 29%; range, 1%-99%) compared with healthy dogs (median, 88%; 4%-96%; P = .049). The percent of secondary fUBA in dogs with CE increased from baseline values (median, 28%; range, 1%-99%) after 2-3 months of treatment (median, 94%; range, 1%-99%; P = 0.0183).These findings suggest that corticosteroids regulate fecal bile  in dogs with CE.

Short-chain fatty  (SCFAs) derived from the fermentation of plant-based nonsoluble fiber bind to G-protein-coupled receptors (GPR) GPR 41 and GPR 43 to induce enteroendocrine molecules that control appetite, and to upregulate intestinal gluconeogenesis gene expression that controls glucose regulation. "Metabolic endotexemia" reflects a state of low-grade systemic inflammation that results from lipopolysaccharide (LPS) release from the gut into the systemic circulation in response to a high-fat diet. Inflammatory pathways induced by LPS, activation of toll-like receptor-4 (TLR-4), and other inflammatory signaling pathways are mediators of systemic inflammation, insulin resistance and type II diabetes mellitus.Recent scientific data support that derangements in the composition of the microbiota, termed "microbiome " is a factor in the development of "metabolic endotoxemia" and T2DM.

When hydrogen peroxide (HO) attacks the most-studied [4Fe-4S] fumarases, only the cluster is damaged, and thus the cell can rapidly repair the enzyme. However, this study shows that when elevated levels of HO oxidized the class I fumarase of the obligate anaerobe Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (Bt-Fum), a hydroxyl-like radical species was produced that caused irreversible covalent damage to the polypeptide. Unlike the fumarase of oxygen-tolerant bacteria, Bt-Fum lacks a key cysteine residue in the typical "CXCXC″ motif that ligands [4Fe-4S] clusters. Consequently HO can access and oxidize an iron atom other than the catalytic one in its cluster. Phylogenetic analysis showed that certain clades of bacteria may have evolved the full "CXCXC″ motif to shield the [4Fe-4S] cluster of fumarase. This effect was reproduced by the construction of a chimeric enzyme. These data demonstrate the irreversible oxidation of Fe-S cluster enzymes and may recapitulate evolutionary steps that occurred when microorganisms originally confronted oxidizing environments.

Inactivation of antibiotics in the small intestine represents a novel strategy to protect the colonic microbiota. SYN-004 (ribaxamase) is a beta-lactamase formulated for oral delivery intended to degrade intravenously administered beta-lactam antibiotics in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. The enteric coating of ribaxamase protects the enzyme from stomach  and mediates pH-dependent release in the upper small intestine, the site of antibiotic biliary excretion. Clinical benefit was established in animal and human studies in which ribaxamase was shown to degrade ceftriaxone in the GI tract, thereby preserving the gut microbiome, significantly reducing  disease, and attenuating antibiotic resistance. To expand ribaxamase utility to oral beta-lactams, delayed release formulations of ribaxamase, SYN-007, were engineered to allow enzyme release in the lower small intestine, distal to the site of oral antibiotic absorption. Based on in vitro dissolution profiles, three SYN-007 formulations were selected for evaluation in a canine model of antibiotic-mediated gut . Dogs received amoxicillin (40 mg/kg, PO, TID) +/- SYN-007 (10 mg, PO, TID) for five days. Serum amoxicillin levels were measured after the first and last antibiotic doses and gut microbiomes were evaluated using whole genome shotgun sequence metagenomics analyses of fecal DNA prior to and after antibiotic treatment. Serum amoxicillin levels did not significantly differ +/- SYN-007 after the first dose for all SYN-007 formulations, while only one SYN-007 formulation did not significantly reduce systemic antibiotic concentrations after the last dose. Gut microbiomes of animals receiving amoxicillin alone displayed significant loss of diversity and emergence of antibiotic resistance genes. In contrast, for animals receiving amoxicillin + SYN-007, microbiome diversities were not altered significantly and the presence of antibiotic resistance genes was reduced. These data demonstrate that SYN-007 diminishes amoxicillin-mediated microbiome disruption and mitigates emergence and propagation of antibiotic resistance genes without interfering with antibiotic systemic absorption. Thus, SYN-007 has the potential to protect the gut microbiome by inactivation of beta-lactam antibiotics when administered by both oral and parenteral routes and to reduce emergence of antibiotic-resistant pathogens.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30972037>Mechanistic Insights Into Probiotic Properties of Lactic  Bacteria Associated With Ethnic Fermented Dairy Products.</a></h2><p>Gut microbes and their metabolites maintain the health and homeostasis of the host by communicating with the host  various biochemical and physical factors. Changing lifestyle, chronic intake of foods rich in refined carbohydrates and fats have caused intestinal  and other lifestyle-based diseases. Thus, supplementation with probiotics has gained popularity as biotherapies for improving gut health and treating disorders. Research shows that probiotic organisms enhance gastrointestinal health, immunomodulation, generation of essential micronutrients, and prevention of cancer. Ethnically fermented milk and dairy products are hotspots for novel probiotic organisms and bioactive compounds. These ethnic fermented foods have been traditionally prepared by indigenous populations, and have preserved unique microflora for ages. To apply these unique microflora for amelioration of human health, it is important that probiotic properties of the bacterial species are well studied. Majority of the published research and reviews focus on the probiotic organisms and their properties, fermented food products, isolation techniques, and animal studies with their health pathologies. As a consequence, there is a dearth of information about the underlying molecular mechanism behind probiotics associated with ethnically prepared dairy foods. This review is targeted at stimulating research on understanding these mechanisms of bacterial species and beneficial attributes of ethnically fermented dairy products.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31250035>Bridging intestinal immunity and gut microbiota by metabolites.</a></h2><p>The gastrointestinal tract is the site of nutrient digestion and absorption and is also colonized by diverse, highly mutualistic microbes. The intestinal microbiota has diverse effects on the development and function of the gut-specific immune system, and provides some protection from infectious pathogens. However, interactions between intestinal immunity and microorganisms are very complex, and recent studies have revealed that this intimate crosstalk may depend on the production and sensing abilities of multiple bioactive small molecule metabolites originating from direct produced by the gut microbiota or by the metabolism of dietary components. Here, we review the interplay between the host immune system and the microbiota, how commensal bacteria regulate the production of metabolites, and how these microbiota-derived products influence the function of several major innate and adaptive immune cells involved in modulating host immune homeostasis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31471539>Microbiota signatures relating to reduced memory and exploratory behaviour in the offspring of overweight mothers in a murine model.</a></h2><p>An elevated number of women of reproductive age are overweight, predisposing their offspring to metabolic and neuropsychiatric disorders. Gut microbiota is influenced by maternal factors, and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. Our aim was to explore the effects of maternal high-fat feeding on the relationship linking gut microbiota and cognitive development in the offspring. Murine offspring born to dams undergoing normal diet (NDm) and high-fat diet (HFDm) were studied at 1 or 6 months of age to assess cognitive function by Y-maze test, cerebral glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity by Positron Emission Tomography, brain density by Computed Tomography, microbiota profile (colon, caecum) and inferred metabolic pathways (KEGG analysis) by 16S ribosomal RNA sequencing. From 3 weeks post-weaning, mice born to HFDm developed hyperphagia and overweight, showing reduction in memory and exploratory behaviour, and brain insulin resistance in adulthood. We identified a panel of bacteria characterizing offspring born to HFD dams from early life, and correlating with dysfunction in memory and exploratory behaviour in adults (including Proteobacteria phylum, Parabacteroides and unclassified Rikenellaceae genera). Microbiota-derived metabolic pathways involved in fatty , essential aminoacid and vitamin processing, sulphur metabolism, glutaminergic activation and Alzheimer's disease were differently present in the HFDm and NDm offspring groups. Our results document tight relationships between gut  and memory and behavioural impairment in relation to maternal HFD. Persistent bacterial signatures induced by maternal HFD during infancy can influence cognition during adulthood, opening the possibility of microbiota-targeted strategies to contrast cognitive decline.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31145641>Daphnetin ameliorates experimental colitis by modulating microbiota composition and T/T17 balance.</a></h2><p>Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) are characterized by chronic pathologies associated with extensive gut  and intestinal inflammation. Hence, endeavors to improve the inflammatory pathology by manipulating gut microbiota are ongoing. Daphnetin (DAPH) is a coumarin derivative extracted from  with anti-inflammatory and immune-regulatory properties that has been widely used in treating inflammatory disorders. Herein, we showed that DAPH remarkably alleviated experimental colitis by reducing colonic inflammation, improving colonic integrity, and reestablishing immune and metabolic homeostasis in the inflicted intestines. Our analysis showed that DAPH modified the composition of gut microbiota and altered the metabolic profiles in dextran sulfate sodium-treated mice. In particular, this agent significantly elevated the abundance of short-chain fatty  (SCFA)-producing gut microbiota, causatively related with the enhanced development of T cells and the reduced proinflammatory T17 cell differentiation. More critically, the protective effect of DAPH was shown to be transmissible among colitic mice through cohousing or fecal microbiota transplantation, further substantiating the importance of SCFA-producing gut microbiota in DAPH action. We thus for the first time reveal the potential of DAPH in resetting the gut microbiome and reestablishing immune homeostasis in colitic mice, which may have clinical implications for treating IBD.-Ji, J., Ge, X., Chen, Y., Zhu, B., Wu, Q., Zhang, J., Shan, J., Cheng, H., Shi, L.

Data are limited on the signatures of the intestinal microbiome in SBS with different anatomical types.The aim of our investigation was to characterize the composition and function of gut microbiota in SBS with or without ileocecal resection (ICR).Six-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent 75% small bowel resection (SBR) with the ileocecal junction intact (SBR group, jejunoileal anastomosis, n = 10) or removed (ICR group, jejunocolic anastomosis, n = 10), or sham surgery (sham group, n = 10). Colonic contents of the rats were collected 28 days after operation, and 16S rRNA gene sequencing was performed on the MiSeq Illumina platform to analyze bacterial composition.Overall structures of the gut microbiome differed significantly among the three groups. The bacterial α-diversity of the ICR group was remarkably lower than that of the sham group. ICR rats were enriched with Lactobacillus and opportunistic pathogens from Proteobacteria but depleted of commensal genera belonging to the Lachnospiraceae, Ruminococcaceae and Erysipelotrichaceae families. Genera from the Bacteroidales S24-7 group, Porphyromonadaceae, Prevotellaceae, Rikenellaceae and Christensenellaceae were prevalent in SBR rats. Functional pathways of branched-chain and aromatic amino  biosynthesis, lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis and infectious diseases were abundant in the ICR group, while SBR rats featured pathways of C5 branched dibasic  metabolism, biotin metabolism and one carbon pool folate.ICR causes dramatically more severe intestinal  than SBR only in SBS rat models, resulting in altered functional profiles of the gut microbiome.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31576875>Crocin-I ameliorates the disruption of lipid metabolism and dysbiosis of the gut  induced by chronic corticosterone in mice.</a></h2><p>Glucocorticoids (GCs) are widely used as anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive drugs. However, chronic treatment with GCs in clinical settings has a series of side effects, such as metabolic disorders, gut  dysbiosis and neurological impairment. Therefore, searching for a functional substance that can alleviate these side effects is greatly meaningful to clinical patients. Crocin is the main active ingredient of saffron, which has been reported to have numerous pharmacological activities. However, the action of crocin-I, one major member of the crocin family, on the physiological mediation in the individuals receiving GC treatment remains unclear. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the efficacy of crocin-I on lipid metabolism and the gut  in a mouse model of chronic corticosterone (CORT) treatment. Our findings showed that crocin-I reduced the levels of triglycerides and total cholesterol and the ratio of low density lipoprotein to high density lipoprotein in the serum of CORT-treated mice. In addition, transcriptome analysis revealed that crocin-I was effective in mediating the amelioration of lipid metabolism, mainly in fatty  metabolism and steroid biosynthesis in CORT-treated mice. Moreover, metabolome analysis demonstrated that crocin-I could restore the disturbed metabolites in the liver of CORT-treated mice, most of which are long-chain fatty . Furthermore, high-throughput sequencing of 16s rRNA revealed that crocin-I could mitigate the dysbiosis of the gut  caused by CORT at a dose of 40 mg kg-1, by resulting in a significant increase in the alpha diversity of the microbes in the cecal contents and a significant reduction in the abundance of Firmicutes, whereas by increasing the abundance of Bacteroidetes. These results indicated that oral administration of crocin-I could modify the composition of the gut  and alleviate hepatic lipid disorder in mice treated with a high dose of GCs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31320101>Hyaluronic  behavior in oral administration and perspectives for nanotechnology-based formulations: A review.</a></h2><p>Hyaluronic  (HA) is a ubiquitous polysaccharide with diverse biological functions. Is known that in the intestinal epithelium, the exogenous HA of molar mass ≥10 Da orally administered antagonizes TLR4 overexpression resulting from  and promotes immunomodulation in multifactorial crosstalk, thus helping to treat or to prevent injuries. As macromolecules mediate cell signaling, the three-dimensional structure of HA plays a vital role in those functions. Introducing HA in terms of its molecular structure, its spatial architecture as dependent on pH, concentration and molar mass, occurrence, biological functions and turnover in the tissues, this review addresses the HA in the gastrointestinal system, the molecular dynamics of intestinal uptake and signaling, immunomodulation at intestinal and systemic levels and HA fate to other tissues. Finally, at the light of these behaviors, a nanotechnological approach is presented as progress in the field of the oral HA administration and discussed with perspectives for future developments.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

While it has been suggested to cause nervous impairment, its neurophysiological basis remains unknown. Therefore, the aim of this study is to unravel the effects of NASH, through the interrelationship of liver, gut microbiota, and nervous system, on the brain and human behavior. To this end, 40 Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into a control group that received normal chow and a NASH group that received a high-fat, high-cholesterol diet. Our results show that 14 weeks of the high-fat, high-cholesterol diet induced clinical conditions such as NASH, including steatosis and increased levels of ammonia. Rats in the NASH group also demonstrated evidence of gut  and decreased levels of short-chain fatty  in the gut. This may explain the deficits in cognitive ability observed in the NASH group, including their depressive-like behavior and short-term memory impairment characterized in part by deficits in social recognition and prefrontal cortex-dependent spatial working memory. We also reported the impact of this NASH-like condition on metabolic and functional processes. Brain tissue demonstrated lower levels of metabolic brain activity in the prefrontal cortex, thalamus, hippocampus, amygdala, and mammillary bodies, accompanied by a decrease in dopamine levels in the prefrontal cortex and cerebellum and a decrease in noradrenalin in the striatum. In this article, we emphasize the important role of ammonia and gut-derived bacterial toxins in liver-gut-brain neurodegeneration and discuss the metabolic and functional brain regional deficits and behavioral impairments in NASH.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31551944>Alterations in Gut  by Statin Therapy and Possible Intermediate Effects on Hyperglycemia and Hyperlipidemia.</a></h2><p>Dysbiosis of the gut  is a contributing factor for obesity-related metabolic diseases such as hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia. Pharmacotherapy for metabolic diseases involves the modulation of gut , which is suggested to be a potential therapeutic target. In this study, the modulation of gut  by statins (cholesterol-lowering drugs: atorvastatin and rosuvastatin) was investigated in an aged mouse model of high-fat diet-induced obesity, and the association between gut  and immune responses was described. Atorvastatin and rosuvastatin significantly increased the abundance of the genera , , and  Moreover, the abundance of these genera was correlated with the inflammatory response, including levels of IL-1β and TGFβ1 in the ileum. In addition, oral fecal  transplantation with fecal material collected from rosuvastatin-treated mouse groups improved hyperglycemia. From these results, the effect of statins on metabolic improvements could be explained by altered gut . Our findings suggest that the modulation of gut  by statins has an important role in the therapeutic actions of these drugs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31490117>Obstructive Sleep Apnea and Systemic Hypertension: Gut  as the Mediator?</a></h2><p>Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and systemic hypertension (SH) are common and interrelated diseases. It is estimated that approximately 75% of treatment-resistant hypertension cases have an underlying OSA. Exploration of the gut microbiome is a new advance in medicine that has been linked to many comorbid illnesses, including SH and OSA. Here, we will review the literature in SH and gut , OSA and gut , and whether gut  is common in both conditions.We reviewed the National Center for Biotechnology Information database, including PubMed and PubMed Central. We identified a total of 230 articles. The literature search was conducted using the phrase "obstructive sleep apnea and gut ." Only original research articles were included. This yielded a total of 12 articles.Most of the research conducted in this field was on animal models, and almost all trials confirmed that intermittent hypoxia models resulted in gut . Gut , however, can cause a state of low-grade inflammation through damage to the gut wall barrier resulting in "leaky gut." Neuroinflammation is a hallmark of the pathophysiology of OSA-induced SH.Gut  seems to be an important factor in the pathophysiology of OSA-induced hypertension. Reversing gut  at an early stage through prebiotics and probiotics and fecal microbiota transplantation combined with positive airway pressure therapy may open new horizons of treatment to prevent SH.

Biotransformation of primary to secondary bile  have been known to be involved in the immune regulation of human physiology. Several 16S amplicon-based studies with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) subjects were found to have an association with the level of fecal bile . However, a detailed investigation of all the bile salt biotransformation genes in the gut microbiome of healthy and IBD subjects has not been performed.Here, we report a comprehensive analysis of the bile salt biotransformation genes and their distribution at the phyla level. Based on the analysis of shotgun metagenomes, we found that the IBD subjects harbored a significantly lower abundance of these genes compared to the healthy controls. Majority of these genes originated from Firmicutes in comparison to other phyla. From metabolomics data, we found that the IBD subjects were measured with a significantly low level of secondary bile  and high levels of primary bile  compared to that of the healthy controls.Our bioinformatics-driven approach of identifying bile salt biotransformation genes predicts the bile salt biotransformation potential in the gut microbiota of IBD subjects.

The aim of this study was to take advantage of a large well-defined corticosteroids treatment-naïve group of patients with autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) to rigorously characterise gut  compared with healthy controls.We performed a cross-sectional study of individuals with AIH (n=91) and matched healthy controls (n=98) by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. An independent cohort of 28 patients and 34 controls was analysed to validate the results. All the patients were collected before corticosteroids therapy.The gut microbiome of steroid treatment-naïve AIH was characterised with lower alpha-diversity (Shannon and observed operational taxonomic units, both p<0.01) and distinct overall microbial composition compared with healthy controls (p=0.002). Depletion of obligate anaerobes and expansion of potential pathobionts including  were associated with disease status. Of note, , the most strongly disease-associated taxa (p=8.85E-8), positively correlated with serum level of aspartate aminotransferase and liver inflammation. Furthermore, the combination of four patients with AIH-associated genera distinguished AIH from controls with an area under curves of approximately 0.8 in both exploration and validation cohorts. In addition, multiple predicted functional modules were altered in the AIH gut microbiome, including lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis as well as metabolism of amino  that can be processed by bacteria to produce immunomodulatory metabolites.Our study establishes compositional and functional alterations of gut microbiome in AIH and suggests the potential for using gut microbiota as non-invasive biomarkers to assess disease activity.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

Here, we examined whether metabolic profiling is a feasible method of monitoring intestinal  in critically ill children.Prospective multicenter cohort study.Three U.K.-based PICUs.Mechanically ventilated critically ill (n = 60) and age-matched healthy children (n = 55).Collection of urine and fecal samples in children admitted to the PICU. A single fecal and urine sample was collected in healthy controls.Untargeted and targeted metabolic profiling using 1H-nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry or urine and fecal samples. This was integrated with analysis of fecal bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA profiles and clinical disease severity indicators. We observed separation of global urinary and fecal metabolic profiles in critically ill compared with healthy children. Urinary excretion of mammalian-microbial co-metabolites hippurate, 4-cresol sulphate, and formate were reduced in critical illness compared with healthy children. Reduced fecal excretion of short-chain fatty  (including butyrate, propionate, and acetate) were observed in the patient cohort, demonstrating that these metabolites also distinguished between critical illness and health. Dysregulation of intestinal bile metabolism was evidenced by increased primary and reduced secondary fecal bile  excretion. Fecal butyrate correlated with days free of intensive care at 30 days (r = 0.38; p = 0.03), while urinary formate correlated inversely with vasopressor requirement (r = -0.2; p = 0.037).Disruption to the functional activity of the intestinal microbiome may result in worsening organ failure in the critically ill child.

In humans, microbial dysbiosis was observed in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients as well as in those at-risk to develop RA, and is thought to be an environmental trigger for the development of clinical disease. At the same time, diet has a proven impact on maintaining intestinal microbial homeostasis. Given this association, we performed a feasibility study in RA patients using high-fiber dietary supplementation with the objective to restore microbial homeostasis and promote the secretion of beneficial immunomodulatory microbial metabolites. RA patients ( = 36) under routine care received daily high-fiber bars or cereals for 28 days. Clinical assessments and laboratory analysis of immune parameters in blood and stool samples from RA patients were done before and after the high-fiber dietary supplementation. We observed an increase in circulating regulatory T cell numbers, favorable Th1/Th17 ratios, as well as decreased markers of bone erosion in RA patients after 28 days of dietary intervention. Furthermore, patient-related outcomes of RA improved.

Microbial gut  is associated with both AN and SIBO, and therefore gut microbiome changes by serial fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is a possible therapeutic modality. This study assessed the effects of FMT on gut barrier function, microbiota composition, and the levels of bacterial metabolic products. The patient treatment with FMT led to the improvement of gut barrier function, which was altered prior to FMT. Very low bacterial alpha diversity, a lack of beneficial bacteria, together with a great abundance of fungal species were observed in the patient stool sample before FMT. After FMT, both bacterial species richness and gut microbiome evenness increased in the patient, while the fungal alpha diversity decreased. The total short-chain fatty  (SCFAs) levels (molecules presenting an important source of energy for epithelial gut cells) gradually increased after FMT. Contrarily, one of the most abundant intestinal neurotransmitters, serotonin, tended to decrease throughout the observation period. Overall, gut microbial  improvement after FMT was considered.

Among these desirable biological functions, the immune regulation, antioxidative activities, and antimicrobial effects are essential properties to maintain host health. Probiotics can regulate the immune system and improve the antioxidative system by producing microbial components and metabolites. Meanwhile, probiotics also possess antimicrobial abilities owing to their competition for nutrient requirements and mucus adherence, reducing pathogenic toxins, producing antimicrobial metabolites (short-chain fatty , bacteriocins, reuterin, linoleic , and secondary bile ) and enhancing intestinal, or systemic immunity. Therefore, probiotics could be used to alleviate heavy metal toxicity and metabolic disorders by improving immunity, the antioxidative system, and intestinal micro-environment. This comprehensive review mainly highlights the potential health promoting activities of probiotics based on their antioxidative, antimicrobial, and immune regulatory effects. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: The antioxidative defense and the immune system are essential to maintain human health. However, many factors may result in microbial  in the gut, which subsequently leads to pathogenic expansion, oxidative stress, and inflammatory responses. Therefore, it is important to explore beneficial foods to prevent or suppress these abnormal responses. Successful application of probiotics in the functional foods has attracted increasing attention due to their immune regulatory, antioxidative, and antimicrobial properties.

In the present study, we examined the changes of gut microbiota in women with early-onset preeclampsia (PE) and in normotensive, uncomplicated pregnant women during late pregnancy and at 1 and 6 weeks postpartum.  Gut microbiota profiles of women with PE and healthy pregnant women in the third trimester and at 1 and 6 weeks postpartum were assessed by 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. Plasma levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6), intestinal fatty -binding protein (I-FABP), zonulin, and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were measured in the third trimesters.  At the genus level, 8 bacterial genera were significantly enriched in the antepartum samples of PE patients compared to healthy controls, of which , and  represented the major variances in PE microbiomes.

Overall, rodent feeding studies show dietary milk SM, milk polar lipid mixtures, and milk fat globule membrane reduce serum and hepatic lipid concentrations. Furthermore, these hypolipidemic effects are observed in some supplementation studies in humans, although the extent of reductions in serum cholesterol is typically smaller and only one trial was conducted with purified SM. Dietary milk SM has been reported to affect the gut microbiota in rodent studies and its hydrolytic product, sphingosine, displays bactericidal activity in vitro. Milk SM may also improve gut barrier function to prevent the translocation of inflammatory gut bacteria-derived molecules. Current evidence from pre-clinical studies indicates that dietary milk SM has protective properties against dysfunctional lipid metabolism, gut , and inflammation. The hypolipidemic effects of milk SM observed in animal studies have been reported in some human studies, although the magnitude of such effects is typically smaller. More research is warranted to clearly define how dietary milk SM influences lipid metabolism, gut microbiota, and inflammation in humans.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are complex diseases that are heterogeneous at the clinical, immunological, molecular, genetic, and microbial levels. Individual contributing factors have been the focus of extensive research. As part of the Integrative Human Microbiome Project (HMP2 or iHMP), we followed 132 subjects for one year each to generate integrated longitudinal molecular profiles of host and microbial activity during disease (up to 24 time points each; in total 2,965 stool, biopsy, and blood specimens). Here we present the results, which provide a comprehensive view of functional  in the gut microbiome during inflammatory bowel disease activity. We demonstrate a characteristic increase in facultative anaerobes at the expense of obligate anaerobes, as well as molecular disruptions in microbial transcription (for example, among clostridia), metabolite pools (acylcarnitines, bile , and short-chain fatty ), and levels of antibodies in host serum. Periods of disease activity were also marked by increases in temporal variability, with characteristic taxonomic, functional, and biochemical shifts. Finally, integrative analysis identified microbial, biochemical, and host factors central to this dysregulation. The study's infrastructure resources, results, and data, which are available through the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Multi'omics Database ( http://ibdmdb.org ), provide the most comprehensive description to date of host and microbial activities in inflammatory bowel diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31624009>Nutritional and dietary strategy in the clinical care of inflammatory bowel disease.</a></h2><p>The incidence and prevalence of inflammatory bowel disease have been increasing for decades and IBD has become a worldwide disease. Epidemiology studies demonstrated higher incidence rates in the more westernized countries. The change of habitual diets in these countries is perceived as the reason for the development of IBD. Besides, molecular biological studies showed some pathogenic substances produced after digestion of daily diet decrease the diversity of intestinal microbiota and cause  of microbiome. Then, chronic inflammation occurs in some genetically susceptible subjects and IBD developed. As a result, many researchers started to investigate the potential therapeutic effects of nutrients and dietary intervention on the clinical course and pathogenesis of IBD. Carbohydrates, fats, proteins and fibers are investigated and their molecular roles in the inflammatory process are discovered gradually. The undigested carbohydrates are proved to cause overgrowth of colonic bacteria and inflammation occurs by altering colonic microbiome. ω-3 poly-unsaturated fatty  are more favored over ω-6 poly-unsaturated fatty  due to its less pro-inflammatory properties. High fibers produce more short-chain fatty  in colon and facilitate the diversity of colonic microbiota. Moreover, some dietary interventions were designed and studied with promising results. Low FODMAP is recommended in IBS and is also suggested in patients of IBD with IBS-like symptoms. Specific Carbohydrate Diet was designed for celiac disease at first and is proved to be effective to decrease inflammation and to induce remission by decreasing non-digested carbohydrates into colon. Exclusive Enteral Nutrition has been investigated and is suggested to be the first line of management in pediatric CD in many literatures. Paleolithic diet and semi-vegetarian diet are evaluated and might be beneficial in some clinical settings. These findings are promising but limited to the evidence without high quality level. Some more well-designed studies with randomization and double-blind are needed and the primary endpoints should be more focused on the decrease of inflammation in pathology and mucosal healing in endoscopy instead of relief of the symptoms.Copyright © 2019.

In our previous trial, a shift in GM structure caused by a complex fiber-rich diet was associated with the health improvement of obese Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) children. The pre- and post-intervention GMs (pre- and post-group, respectively) from one child were then transplanted into gnotobiotic mice, which resulted in significantly different physiological phenotypes, each of which was similar to the phenotype of the corresponding GM donor. This study was designed to investigate the miRNA-gene regulatory networks involved in causing these phenotypic differences. Using the post-group as a reference, we systematically identified and annotated the differentially expressed (DE) miRNAs and genes in the colon and liver of the pre-group in the second and fourth weeks after GM inoculation. Most of the significantly enriched GO terms and KEGG pathways were observed in the liver and were in the second week after GM transplantation. We screened 23 key genes along with their 73 miRNA regulators relevant to the host phenotype changes and constructed a network. The network contained 92 miRNA-gene regulation relationships, 51 of which were positive, and 41 of which were negative. Both the colon and liver had upregulated pro-inflammatory genes, and genes involved in fatty  oxidation, lipolysis, and plasma cholesterol clearance were downregulated in only the liver. These changes were consistent with lipid and cholesterol accumulation in the host and with a high inflammation level. In addition, the colon showed an impacted glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) signaling pathway, while the liver displayed decreased insulin receptor signaling pathway activity. These molecular changes were mainly found in the second week, 2 weeks before changes in body fat occurred. This time lag indicated that GM  might initially induce cholesterol and lipid metabolism-related miRNA and gene expression disorder and then lead to lipid accumulation and obesity development, which implicates a causative role of GM  in obesity development rather than a result of obesity. This study provides fundamental molecular information that elucidates how dysbiotic GM increases host inflammation and disturbs host lipid and glucose metabolism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31082907>Antibiotic-induced Disruption of Intestinal Microbiota Contributes to Failure of Vertical Sleeve Gastrectomy.</a></h2><p>The aim of this study was to test whether the perioperative composition of intestinal microbiota can contribute to variable outcomes following vertical sleeve gastrectomy (VSG).Although bariatric surgery is the most effective treatment for obesity, metabolic outcomes are variable.Diet-induced obese mice were randomized to VSG or sham surgery, with or without exposure to antibiotics that selectively suppress mainly gram-positive (fidaxomicin, streptomycin) or gram-negative (ceftriaxone) bacteria on postoperative days (POD) 1-4. Fecal microbiota was characterized before surgery and on POD 7 and 28. Mice were metabolically characterized on POD 30-32 and euthanized on POD 35.VSG resulted in weight loss and shifts in the intestinal microbiota composition relative to sham-operated mice. Antibiotic exposure resulted in sustained reductions in alpha (within-sample) diversity of microbiota and shifts in its composition. All antibiotic treatments proved to be detrimental to metabolic VSG outcomes, regardless of antimicrobial specificity of antibiotics. These effects involved functionally distinct pathways. Specifically, fidaxomicin and streptomycin markedly altered hepatic bile  signaling and lipid metabolism, while ceftriaxone resulted in greater reduction of key antimicrobial peptides. However, VSG mice exposed to antibiotics, regardless of their specificity, had significantly increased subcutaneous adiposity and impaired glucose homeostasis without changes in food intake relative to control VSG mice. induced by brief perioperative antibiotic exposure attenuates weight loss and metabolic improvement following VSG. Potential mechanisms include disruption of bile  homeostasis and reduction in the production of gut antimicrobial peptides. Results of this study implicate the intestinal microbiota as an important contributor to metabolic homeostasis and a potentially modifiable target influencing clinical outcomes following VSG.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31483636>Gut Microbiota and Metabolome Response of  Seed Oil on Metabolism Disorder Induced by Excess Alcohol Consumption.</a></h2><p>This study investigated the modulatory effects of  seed oil (DISO), which was rich in palmitoleic  (55.25%), palmitic  (12.25%), and oleic  (28.74%), on alcohol-induced metabolism disorder in mice. Fifty mice were orally administered with 38% alcohol (0.4 mL/day) and without or with DISO (3, 6, and 12 g/kg) for consecutive 12 weeks. DISO inhibited the alcohol-induced weight loss and liver function abnormality ( < 0.01) and shifted the profiles of cecal microbiome: elevating the abundance of , __004 ( < 0.05) and decreasing abundance of  ( < 0.05). This treatment also regulated metabolome response of amino  and lipid metabolism in cecal content: upregulating 5-hydroxyindole-3-acetic  ( < 0.05), 6-hydroxynicotinic , 5-methoxytryptamine, nicotinamide, and nicotinic  ( < 0.1) and downregulating androsterone, tryptophan, and indole-3-acetamide ( < 0.05).

The study aimed to describe specific metagenomic/metabolomics profiles of different SBS types and to identify possible therapeutic targets.Fecal microbiome (FM), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and bile  (BA) spectrum were analyzed in parenteral nutrition (PN)-dependent SBS I, SBS II, and PN-independent (non-PN) SBS patients.FM in SBS I, SBS II, and non-PN SBS shared characteristic features (depletion of beneficial anaerobes, high abundance of Lactobacilaceae and Enterobacteriaceae). SBS I patients were characterized by the abundance of oxygen-tolerant microrganisms and depletion of strict anaerobes. Non-PN SBS subjects showed markers of partial FM normalization. FM  was translated into VOC and BA profiles characteristic for each SBS cohort. A typical signature of all SBS patients comprised high saturated aldehydes and medium-chain fatty  and reduced short-chain fatty  (SCFA) content. Particularly, SBS I and II exhibited low protein metabolism intermediate (indole, p-cresol) content despite the hypothetical presence of relevant metabolism pathways. Distinctive non-PN SBS marker was high phenol content. SBS patients' BA fecal spectrum was enriched by chenodeoxycholic and deoxycholic  and depleted of lithocholic .Environmental conditions in SBS gut significantly affect FM composition and metabolic activity. The common feature of diverse SBS subjects is the altered VOC/BA profile and the lack of important products of microbial metabolism. Strategies oriented on the microbiome/metabolome reconstitution and targeted delivery of key compounds may represent a promising therapeutic strategy in SBS patients.© 2019 American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31336215>Impact of different hypercaloric diets on obesity features in rats: a metagenomics and metabolomics integrative approach.</a></h2><p>Diet is considered a key influencing agent affecting the gut microbiome.  of microbial communities contributes to the development of metabolic diseases such as obesity. We aimed to characterize the physiological, microbial and metabolic changes induced by different obesogenic diets to understand the diet-specific modulation of the host-microbiota co-metabolism in rodents. For this purpose, Wistar rats were fed standard, cafeteria (CAF), low-fat (LF), high-fat (HF) and high-fat high-sucrose (HFS) diets for 10 weeks. The CAF diet strongly induced an obese phenotype accompanied by dyslipidemia, hyperleptinemia, insulin resistance and hepatic steatosis, whereas both HF and HFS diets promoted overweight. Concerning the microbiome, CAF feeding induced a rise of the Bacteroidetes-to-Firmicutes ratio, while few microbial genera were altered in the HF or HFS group. Changes in microbial activity according to dietary treatment were also reflected in the disruption of short-chain fatty  production and bile  metabolism, which were mainly associated with fiber intake. Urinary metabolomics revealed a significant increase in metabolites related to oxidative stress and metabolic inflammation together with an altered excretion of host-microbiota co-metabolites only in the CAF group. Moreover, several associations between metabolic patterns, physiological status and specific microbial communities were described, helping to elucidate the crucial role of the microbiota in host homeostasis. Overall, our study suggests that different hypercaloric dietary models distinctively influence gut microbiota composition and reveals robust and similar clustering patterns concerning both cecal microbiome and urinary metabolome profiles.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Collectively these microorganisms contribute to the microbiome and often reside in the gut. The gut microbiome plays an important role in the body and contributes to digestive health, the immune system, and brain function. The gut microbiome interacts with the central nervous system through the vagal pathways as well as the endocrine or immune pathways. Changes in the proportion or diversity of the microbiota can have an impact on normal physiology and has been implicated in inflammation, depression, obesity, and addiction. Several animal studies suggest the involvement of gut microbiome in the regulation of pain, emotion, and cognition. Alcoholism has been linked with gut microbiome  and thus can have deleterious effects on the gut-brain axis balance. Gut microbiome produces important metabolites such as gastrointestinal hormones, short chain fatty , precursors to the neuroactive compounds and neurotransmitters that impact the physiology and normal functioning of the body. The microbiome imbalance has been correlated with behavioral changes and alcohol dependence in the host. The objective of this study is to elucidate the link between alcohol induced gut microbiota  and any behavioral impact that could incur. A thorough literature search of various databases was conducted to gather data for the alcohol prompted gut microbiome . Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software was then utilized to identify links between alcoholism, gut microbiome derived metabolites, and their role in behavior alterations. Overall, this meta-analysis reviews information available on the connection between alcohol induced gut microbiome  and the resulting behavioral impact.Copyright © 2019.

Significant differences exist between the gastric microbiome of those with gastritis, intestinal metaplasia and GC, suggesting that  in the stomach is dynamic and correlates with progression to GC. Most notably, a consistent increase in abundance of lactic  bacteria (LAB) has been observed in GC patients including Streptococcus, Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium and Lactococcus. This review summarises how LAB can influence GC by a number of mechanisms that include supply of exogenous lactate -a fuel source for cancer cells that promotes inflammation, angiogenesis, metastasis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition and immune evasion-, production of reactive oxygen species and N-nitroso compounds, as well as anti-H. pylori properties that enable colonization by other non-H. pylori carcinogenic pathobionts.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has been used in the management of neuropsychiatric diseases for many years in China. In this study, a randomized, controlled trial was conducted to examine the impact of stress on gut microbiota  and depression, and TCM in alleviating the damage using Chronic Unpredictable Mild Stress (CUMS) rats, a well-established rodent model for depression. The behaviors of rats and the profiles of the fecal microbiota were assessed by an array of behavioral tests and 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and the intestinal microbial function was assessed by shotgun sequencing-based metagenomic analysis of microbial DNA from fecal samples. Data on brain targeted metabolites by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) were also discussed. Depressive and anxiety-like behaviors and changes in the fecal microbiota profile were observed in CUMS rats, which were then significantly reversed in CUMS rats that received TCM. Specifically, TCM treatment reduced the levels of Firmicutes, and Ruminococcus, and increased the abundance of Bacteroidetes and Roseburia, reportedly being associated with relieving psychiatric disorders. Furthermore, the levels of brain metabolites perturbed by CUMS were reversed by TCM treatment, and Spearman's correlation analysis illustrated strong correlation between brain metabolites and perturbed fecal microbiota genera. Finally, the fecal microbiome of CUMS rats was characterized by alterations in amino  metabolism and evaluation of bile  biosynthesis, and TCM-treated rats showed elevation of cysteine and methionine metabolism. Overall, these results indicated that administration of the TCM may mitigate CUMS-induced depression-behaviors, and it is correlated with reversing CUMS-induced intestinal microbiota ; evidence also supported related changes in brain metabolites. These findings set up the foundation to further reveal the exact causal relationship among the TCM formula, host responses, gut microbiota  and the levels of brain metabolites, and enabled scientific interpretation of the therapeutic function of the TCM.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31427744>Hyaluronic -bilirubin nanomedicine for targeted modulation of dysregulated intestinal barrier, microbiome and immune responses in colitis.</a></h2><p>While conventional approaches for inflammatory bowel diseases mainly focus on suppressing hyperactive immune responses, it remains unclear how to address disrupted intestinal barriers,  of the gut commensal microbiota and dysregulated mucosal immune responses in inflammatory bowel diseases. Moreover, immunosuppressive agents can cause off-target systemic side effects and complications. Here, we report the development of hyaluronic -bilirubin nanomedicine (HABN) that accumulates in inflamed colonic epithelium and restores the epithelium barriers in a murine model of acute colitis. Surprisingly, HABN also modulates the gut microbiota, increasing the overall richness and diversity and markedly augmenting the abundance of Akkermansia muciniphila and Clostridium XIVα, which are microorganisms with crucial roles in gut homeostasis. Importantly, HABN associated with pro-inflammatory macrophages, regulated innate immune responses and exerted potent therapeutic efficacy against colitis.

The aim is therefore to optimize the current protocol for prebiotic use.To examine the prebiotic properties of plant extracts, two independent studies are conducted in ob/ob mice, over two weeks. In the first study, Porphyra umbilicalis and Melissa officinalis L. extracts are evaluated; in the second study, a high vs low dose of an Emblica officinalis Gaertn extract is assessed. These plant extracts affect gut microbiota, caecum metabolome, and induce a significant lower plasma triacylglycerols (TG) following treatment with P. umbilicalis and significantly higher plasma free fatty  (FFA) following treatment with the low-dose of E. officinalis Gaertn. Glucose- and insulin-tolerance are not affected but white adipose tissue and liver gene expression are modified. In the first study, IL-6 hepatic gene expression is significantly (adjusted p = 0.0015) and positively (r = 0.80) correlated with the bacterial order Clostridiales in all mice.The data show that a two-week treatment with plant extracts affects the dysbiotic gut microbiota and changes both caecum metabolome and markers of lipid metabolism in ob/ob mice.© 2019 The Authors.

Our previous study showed that a high-fructose diet caused the hippocampal neuroinflammatory response and neuronal loss in animals, but the underlying mechanisms remained elusive. Here, alterations in the gut microbiota and intestinal epithelial barrier were investigated as the causes of hippocampal neuroinflammation induced by high-fructose diet.A high-fructose diet caused the hippocampal neuroinflammatory response, reactive gliosis, and neuronal loss in C57BL/6N mice. Depletion of the gut microbiota using broad-spectrum antibiotics suppressed the hippocampal neuroinflammatory response in fructose-fed mice, but these animals still exhibited neuronal loss. Gut microbiota compositional alteration, short-chain fatty  (SCFAs) reduction, intestinal epithelial barrier impairment, NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain-containing 6 (NLRP6) inflammasome dysfunction, high levels of serum endotoxin, and FITC-dextran were observed in fructose-fed mice. Of note, SCFAs, as well as pioglitazone (a selective peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ) agonist), shaped the gut microbiota and ameliorated intestinal epithelial barrier impairment and NLRP6 inflammasome dysfunction in fructose-fed mice. Moreover, SCFAs-mediated NLRP6 inflammasome activation was inhibited by histamine (a bacterial metabolite) in ex vivo colonic explants and suppressed in murine CT26 colon carcinoma cells transfected with NLRP6 siRNA. However, pioglitazone and GW9662 (a PPAR-γ antagonist) exerted no impact on SCFAs-mediated NLRP6 inflammasome activation in ex vivo colonic explants, suggesting that SCFAs may stimulate NLRP6 inflammasome independently of PPAR-γ activation. SCFAs and pioglitazone prevented fructose-induced hippocampal neuroinflammatory response and neuronal loss in mice. Additionally, SCFAs activated colonic NLRP6 inflammasome and increased DCX newborn neurons in the hippocampal DG of control mice.Our findings reveal that gut  is a critical factor for a high-fructose diet-induced hippocampal neuroinflammation in C57BL/6N mice possibly mediated by impairing intestinal epithelial barrier. Mechanistically, the defective colonic NLRP6 inflammasome is responsible for intestinal epithelial barrier impairment. SCFAs can stimulate NLRP6 inflammasome and ameliorate the impairment of intestinal epithelial barrier, resulting in the protection against a high-fructose diet-induced hippocampal neuroinflammation and neuronal loss. This study addresses a gap in the understanding of neuronal injury associated with Western-style diets. A new intervention strategy for reducing the risk of neurodegenerative diseases through SCFAs supplementation or dietary fiber consumption is emphasized.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31490732>Can Intestinal Microbiota and Circulating Microbial Products Contribute to Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension?</a></h2><p>Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a fatal disease with a median survival of only 5-7 years. PAH is characterized by remodeling of the pulmonary vasculature causing reduced pulmonary arterial compliance (PAC) and increased pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), ultimately resulting in right ventricular failure and death. Better therapies for PAH will require a paradigm shift in our understanding of the early pathophysiology. PAC decreases before there is an increase in the PVR. Unfortunately, current treatment has little effect on PAC. The loss of compliance correlates with extracellular matrix remodeling and fibrosis in the pulmonary vessels, which has been linked to chronic perivascular inflammation and immune dysregulation. However, what initiates the perivascular inflammation and immune dysregulation in PAH is unclear. Alteration of the gut microbiota composition and function underlies the level of immunopathogenic involvement in several diseases, including atherosclerosis, obesity, diabetes mellitus and depression, among others. In this review, we discuss evidence that raises the possibility of an etiologic role for changes in the gut and circulating microbiome in the initiation of perivascular inflammation in the early pathogenesis of PAH.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31214133>Intervening Effects of Total Alkaloids of  Bunting on Rats With Antibiotic-Induced Gut Microbiota  Based on 16S rRNA Gene Sequencing and Untargeted Metabolomics Analyses.</a></h2><p>Gut microbiota  induced by antibiotics is strongly connected with health concerns. Studying the mechanisms underlying antibiotic-induced gut microbiota  could help to identify effective drugs and prevent many serious diseases. In this study, in rats with antibiotic-induced gut microbiota  treated with total alkaloids of  Bunting (TACS), urinary and fecal biochemical changes and cecum microbial diversity were investigated using 16S rRNA gene sequencing analysis and untargeted metabolomics. The microbial diversity results showed that 10 genera were disturbed by the antibiotic treatment, and two of them were obviously restored by TACS. The untargeted metabolomics analysis identified 34 potential biomarkers in urine and feces that may be the metabolites that are most related to the mechanisms underlying antibiotic-induced gut microbiota  and the therapeutic effects of TACS treatment. The biomarkers were involved in six metabolic pathways, comprising pathways related to branched-chain amino  (BCAA), bile , arginine and proline, purine, aromatic amino , and amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism. Notably, there was a strong correlation between these metabolic pathways and two gut microbiota genera ( and ). The correlation analysis suggested that TACS might synergistically affect four of these metabolic pathways (BCAA, bile , arginine and proline, and purine metabolism), thereby modulating gut microbiota . Furthermore, we performed a molecular docking analysis involving simulating high-precision docking and using molecular pathway maps to illuminate the way that ligands (the five main alkaloid components of TACS) act on a complex molecular network, using CYP27A1 (a key enzyme in the bile  synthesis pathway) as the target protein.

Radiation biodosimetry aims to determine characteristic early biomarkers indicative of radiation exposure and is necessary for effective triage after an unanticipated radiological incident. Radiation metabolomics can address this aim by assessing metabolic perturbations following exposure. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) is a standardized platform ideal for compound identification. We performed GC time-of-flight MS for the global profiling of nonhuman primate urine and serum samples up to 60 d after a single 4 Gy γ-ray total body exposure. Multivariate statistical analysis showed higher group separation in urine vs. serum. We identified biofluid markers involved in amino , lipid, purine, and serotonin metabolism, some of which may indicate host microbiome . Sex differences were observed for amino  fold changes in serum samples. Additionally, we explored mitochondrial dysfunction by tricarboxylic  intermediate analysis in the first week with a GC tandem quadrupole MS platform. By adding this temporal component to our previous work exploring dose effects at 7 d, we observed the highest fold changes occurring at 3 d, returning closer to basal levels by 7 d.

Characterizing C. difficile isolated from canines is important for understanding the role that canines may play in CAI. In addition, several studies have suggested that canines carry toxigenic C. difficile asymptomatically, which may imply that there are mechanisms responsible for resistance to CDI in canines that could be exploited to help combat human CDI. To assess the virulence potential of canine-derived C. difficile, we tested whether toxins TcdA and TcdB (hereafter toxins) derived from a canine isolate were capable of causing tight junction disruptions to colonic epithelial cells. Additionally, we addressed whether major differences exist between human and canine cells regarding C. difficile pathogenicity by exposing them to identical toxins. We then examined the canine gut microbiome associated with C. difficile carriage using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and searched for deviations from homeostasis as an indicator of CDI. Finally, we queried 16S rRNA gene sequences for bacterial taxa that may be associated with resistance to CDI in canines. Clostridioides difficile isolated from a canine produced toxins that reduced tight junction integrity in both human and canine cells in vitro. However, canine guts were not dysbiotic in the presence of C. difficile. These findings support asymptomatic carriage in canines and, furthermore, suggest that there are features of the gut microbiome and/or a canine-specific immune response that may protect canines against CDI. We identified two biologically relevant bacteria that may aid in CDI resistance in canines: 1) Clostridium hiranonis, which synthesizes secondary bile  that have been shown to provide resistance to CDI in mice; and 2) Sphingobacterium faecium, which produces sphingophospholipids that may be associated with regulating homeostasis in the canine gut. Our findings suggest that canines may be cryptic reservoirs for C. difficile and, furthermore, that mechanisms of CDI resistance in the canine gut could provide insights into targeted therapeutics for human CDI.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Mice were divided into three groups which received normal chow, HFD and HFD plus stachyose (400 mg/kg), respectively. Results showed that administration of stachyose diminished the HFD-induced upregulation of serum TNF-α level and elevation of peripheral blood leukocyte populations to alleviate the HFD-caused colonic and hepatic inflammation in mice.

This is mediated by multiple microbe-microbe interactions that result in the fermentation of nondigestible carbohydrates and the production of short-chain fatty . Certain species play key metabolic roles in the microbiome, and their disappearance could result in . In this work, a synthetic consortium of 14 gut microbes was studied during the utilization of prebiotic inulin in batch bioreactors. Fermentations were repeated leaving one species out every time, in order to evaluate the impact of their elimination on the system. Substrate consumption, microbial composition, and metabolite production were determined. Single deletions never resulted in a complete loss of bacterial growth or inulin consumption, suggesting functional redundancy.

Our analysis identified specific members that were essential for the function of the consortium. In conclusion, species deletions from microbial consortia could be a useful approach to identify relevant interactions between microorganisms and defining metabolic roles in the gut microbiome. Gut microbes associate, compete for, and specialize in specific metabolic tasks. These interactions are dictated by the cross-feeding of degradation or fermentation products. However, the individual contribution of microbes to the function of the gut microbiome is difficult to evaluate. It is essential to understand the complexity of microbial interactions and how the presence or absence of specific microorganisms affects the stability and functioning of the gut microbiome. The experimental approach of this study could be used for identifying keystone species, in addition to redundant functions and conditions that contribute to community stability. Redundancy is an important feature of the microbiome, and its reduction could be useful for the design of microbial consortia with desired metabolic properties enhancing the tasks of the keystone species.Copyright © 2019 Gutiérrez and Garrido.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30984145>Impacts of Duck-Origin Parvovirus Infection on Cherry Valley Ducklings From the Perspective of Gut Microbiota.</a></h2><p>Duck-origin goose parvovirus (D-GPV) is the causative agent of beak atrophy and dwarfism syndrome (BADS), characterized by growth retardation, skeletal dysplasia, and persistent diarrhea. However, the pathogenic mechanism of D-GPV remains undefined. Here, we first reported the gut microbiome diversity of D-GPV infected Cherry Valley ducks. In the investigation for the influence of D-GPV infection on gut microbiota through a period of infection, we found that D-GPV infection caused gut microbiota  by reducing the prevalence of the dominant genera and decreasing microbial diversity. Furthermore, exfoliation of the intestinal epithelium, proliferation of lymphocytes, up-regulated mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-17A, and IL-22 and down-regulated mRNA expression of anti-inflammatory IL-10 and IL-4 occurred when D-GPV targeted in cecal epithelium. In addition, the content of short chain fatty  (SCFAs) in cecal contents was significantly reduced after D-GPV infection. Importantly, the disorder of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines was associated with the decrease of SCFAs-producing bacteria and the enrichment of opportunistic pathogens. Collectively, the decrease of SCFAs and the enrichment of pathogen-containing gut communities promoted intestinal inflammatory injury. These results may provide a new insight that target the gut microbiota to understand the progression of BADS disease and to research the pathogenic mechanism of D-GPV.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31462412>Integrated Meta-omics Reveals a Fungus-Associated Bacteriome and Distinct Functional Pathways in Clostridioides difficile Infection.</a></h2><p>There has been no prior application of matched metagenomics and metatranscriptomics in  infection (CDI) evaluating the role of fungi in CDI or identifying community functions that contribute to the development of this disease.

Besides bacteria, microbiota comprises yeasts, archaea, protists and viruses, neglected actors in inflammatory bowel disease-associated microbiota. In the past, a great limitation in studying microbiota composition was the low sensitivity of sequencing technologies and that few computational approaches were sufficient to thoroughly analyse the whole microbiome. However, new cutting-edge technologies in nucleic  sequencing, -omics analysis and the innovative statistics and bioinformatics pipelines made possible more sensitive and accurate metagenomics, ultimately identifying novel players in intestinal inflammation, including prokaryotic and eukaryotic viruses, that together form the gut virome. The discovery of peculiar inflammatory bowel disease-associated microbial strains will not only shed new light on inflammatory bowel disease aetiogenesis, they may also support the development of novel therapeutic strategies not merely treating symptoms, but precisely counteracting the primary cause of chronic intestinal inflammation.© Author(s) 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31356922>Combination of cannabinoids, delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD), mitigates experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) by altering the gut microbiome.</a></h2><p>Currently, a combination of marijuana cannabinoids including delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) is used as a drug to treat muscle spasticity in patients with Multiple Sclerosis (MS). Because these cannabinoids can also suppress inflammation, it is unclear whether such patients benefit from suppression of neuroinflammation and if so, what is the mechanism through which cannabinoids act. In the currently study, we used a murine model of MS, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), to study the role of gut microbiota in the attenuation of clinical signs of paralysis and inflammation caused by cannabinoids. THC + CBD treatment attenuated EAE and caused significant decrease in inflammatory cytokines such as IL-17 and IFN-γ while promoting the induction of anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-10 and TGF-β. Use of 16S rRNA sequencing on bacterial DNA extracted from the gut revealed that EAE mice showed high abundance of mucin degrading bacterial species, such as Akkermansia muciniphila (A. muc), which was significantly reduced after THC + CBD treatment. Fecal Material Transfer (FMT) experiments confirmed that THC + CBD-mediated changes in the microbiome play a critical role in attenuating EAE. In silico computational metabolomics revealed that LPS biosynthesis, a key component in gram-negative bacteria such as A. muc, was found to be elevated in EAE mice which was confirmed by demonstrating higher levels of LPS in the brain, while treatment with THC + CBD reversed this trend. EAE mice treated with THC + CBD also had significantly higher levels of short chain fatty  such as butyric, isovaleric, and valeric  compared to naïve or disease controls. Collectively, our data suggest that cannabinoids may attenuate EAE and suppress neuroinflammation by preventing microbial  seen during EAE and promoting healthy gut microbiota.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

However, the past 15 yr have seen the emergence of the microbiota (the trillions of microorganisms within and on our bodies) as one of the key regulators of gut-brain function and has led to the appreciation of the importance of a distinct microbiota-gut-brain axis. This axis is gaining ever more traction in fields investigating the biological and physiological basis of psychiatric, neurodevelopmental, age-related, and neurodegenerative disorders. The microbiota and the brain communicate with each other via various routes including the immune system, tryptophan metabolism, the vagus nerve and the enteric nervous system, involving microbial metabolites such as short-chain fatty , branched chain amino , and peptidoglycans. Many factors can influence microbiota composition in early life, including infection, mode of birth delivery, use of antibiotic medications, the nature of nutritional provision, environmental stressors, and host genetics. At the other extreme of life, microbial diversity diminishes with aging. Stress, in particular, can significantly impact the microbiota-gut-brain axis at all stages of life. Much recent work has implicated the gut microbiota in many conditions including autism, anxiety, obesity, schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease, and Alzheimer's disease. Animal models have been paramount in linking the regulation of fundamental neural processes, such as neurogenesis and myelination, to microbiome activation of microglia. Moreover, translational human studies are ongoing and will greatly enhance the field. Future studies will focus on understanding the mechanisms underlying the microbiota-gut-brain axis and attempt to elucidate microbial-based intervention and therapeutic strategies for neuropsychiatric disorders.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30934533>Glutamatergic Signaling Along The Microbiota-Gut-Brain Axis.</a></h2><p>A complex bidirectional communication system exists between the gastrointestinal tract and the brain. Initially termed the "gut-brain axis" it is now renamed the "microbiota-gut-brain axis" considering the pivotal role of gut microbiota in maintaining local and systemic homeostasis. Different cellular and molecular pathways act along this axis and strong attention is paid to neuroactive molecules (neurotransmitters, i.e., noradrenaline, dopamine, serotonin, gamma aminobutyric  and glutamate and metabolites, i.e., tryptophan metabolites), sustaining a possible interkingdom communication system between eukaryota and prokaryota. This review provides a description of the most up-to-date evidence on glutamate as a neurotransmitter/neuromodulator in this bidirectional communication axis. Modulation of glutamatergic receptor activity along the microbiota-gut-brain axis may influence gut (i.e., taste, visceral sensitivity and motility) and brain functions (stress response, mood and behavior) and alterations of glutamatergic transmission may participate to the pathogenesis of local and brain disorders. In this latter context, we will focus on two major gut disorders, such as irritable bowel syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease, both characterized by psychiatric co-morbidity. Research in this area opens the possibility to target glutamatergic neurotransmission, either pharmacologically or by the use of probiotics producing neuroactive molecules, as a therapeutic approach for the treatment of gastrointestinal and related psychiatric disorders.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31211921>Gut microbiota determines the prevention effects of  (L.)

As a medicinal and edible plant,  (L.) Roem (LC) has abundant nutrients that can effectively reduce obesity risk. However, the interaction between the prevention effects of LC against obesity and the modulating gut microbiota of LC remain obscure. This study demonstrated LC supplementation improved high-fat diet (HFD)-induced gut microbiota  and significantly enhanced short-chain fatty  (SCFA)-producing bacteria (, ) along with SCFA content accumulation in the gut. Meanwhile, LC supplementation substantially restored gut barrier damage in long-term HFD treatment. Moreover, LC supplementation improved HFD-induced overweight, hyperlipidemia, insulin resistance, and chronic inflammation. Gene expression profiles showed that LC displayed an important impact on hepatic lipid transport and lipid synthesis (sterol regulatory element binding transcriptional factor 1cperoxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ signaling pathway). More importantly, an antibiotic treatment experiment demonstrated that the beneficial effects of LC in reducing obesity risk largely depended on the gut microbiota, especially SCFA-producing bacteria (, ). Therefore, LC supplementation improved gut microbiota   enhancing SCFA-producing bacteria (, ), maintained gut barrier integrity, and alleviated the development of obesity. Overall, LC would provide a potential dietary intervention strategy against obesity and enteral homeostasis  through modulating the gut microbiota.-Zhang, L., Shi, M., Ji, J., Hu, X., Chen, F.

Many of them have displayed excellence in utilising dietary- and host-derived complex glycans and are producing useful postbiotics including short-chain fatty  to primarily fuel different organs of the host. Therefore, employing individual microbiota is nowadays becoming a propitious target in biomedical for improving gut  conditions of the host. Among other gut microbial communities, Bacteroides and Bifidobacteria are coevolved to utilise diverse ranges of diet- and host-derived glycans through harmonising distinct glycan utilisation systems. These gut symbionts frequently share digested oligosaccharides, carbohydrate-active enzymes and fermentable intermediate molecules for sustaining gut microbial symbiosis and improving fitness of own or other communities. Genomics approaches have provided unprecedented insights into these functions, but their precise mechanisms of action have poorly known. Sympathetic glycan-utilising strategy of each gut commensal will provide overview of mechanistic dynamic nature of the gut environment and will then assist in applying aptly personalised nutritional therapy.

Diabetes increases the risk for cardiovascular disease and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Primary bile  are synthesized in hepatocytes and are transformed to secondary bile  in the intestine by gut bacteria. Bile  are nutrient sensors and metabolic integrators that regulate lipid, glucose, and energy homeostasis by activating nuclear farnesoid X receptor and membrane Takeda G protein-coupled receptor 5. Bile  control gut bacteria overgrowth, species population, and protect the integrity of the intestinal barrier. Gut bacteria, in turn, control circulating bile  composition and pool size. Dysregulation of bile  homeostasis and  causes diabetes and obesity.

UDCA is also a long-established drug, largely used for the dissolution of cholesterol gallstones, the treatment of primary biliary cholangitis and other hepatobiliary disorders. The history of UDCA is briefly retraced here as well as its multifactorial mechanism of action, based on its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and cytoprotective activities. The present review is centred around the anticancer properties of UDCA and synthetic antitumor derivatives designed over the past 20 years. Paradoxically, depending on the conditions, UDCA exhibits both pro- and anti-apoptotic properties toward different cell types. In particular, the UDCA drug can protect epithelial cells from damages and apoptosis while inducing inhibition of proliferation and apoptotic and/or autophagic death of cancer cells. The effects of UDCA on cancer cell migration, cancer stem cells and drug-induced  are also evoked. The drug has revealed modest activities against colon and gastric cancers but may be useful to improve treatments of hepatocellular carcinoma, notably in combination with other drugs such as sorafenib. UDCA can also protect from damages induced by cancer chemotherapeutic agents. The potential of UDCA in cancer, as a chemo-protecting or chemotherapeutic agent, is highlighted here as well as the design of tumour-active derivatives, including UDCA-drug conjugates.

We investigated the influence of the gut microbiota on persistent NAFLD. This cohort study included 766 subjects with 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequencing data from fecal samples at baseline who underwent repeated health check-up examinations. Fatty liver was determined using ultrasound at baseline and follow-up. Participants were categorized into four groups: none (control), developed, regressed, or persistent NAFLD. The persistent NAFLD group had lower richness compared with the control group. Significant differences were also found in both non-phylogenic and phylogenic beta diversity measures according to NAFLD persistence. Pairwise comparisons indicated that taxa abundance mainly differed between the control and persistent NAFLD groups. A relative high abundance of Fusobacteria and low abundance of genera  and  of the family Ruminococcaceae and genus  of the family Lachnospiraceae were found in the persistent NAFLD group. Based on the functional predictions, pathways related to primary and secondary bile  biosynthesis were highly detected in the persistent NAFLD group compared with the control group. These findings support that the composition of the gut microbiome associated with dysregulation of bile  biosynthetic pathways may contribute to the persistence of NAFLD. This is the first cohort study to demonstrate the influence of microbiota on persistent NAFLD.

Phytochemicals and vitamin D are useful for the regulation of inflammatory responses. Phytochemicals is the generic name for terpenoids, carotenoids, and flavonoids that consist of a variety of chemicals contained in vegetables and fruits. There are a variety of grape cultivars that contain many kinds of phytochemicals in their skin and seeds. Grape phytochemicals including Grape Seed Extracts (GSE) have already been used to maintain healthy condition through manipulating inflammatory responses by decreasing the expression of inflammation-related factors.Grape phytochemicals mainly consist of a variety of chemicals that include terpenoid (oleanolic ), carotenoids (β-carotene, lutein), and flavonoids: flavon-3-ols (quercetin), flavan-3-ols (catechins), anthocyanins, oligomers and polymers (tannins and proanthocyanidins), and resveratrol. Phytochemicals improve the  (gut microbiota complication) induced by metabolic syndrome and regulate inflammatory diseases induced by TNF-α production. Once absorbed, flavonoids change into glucuronide-form, move into the bloodstream and reach the inflammatory sites including liver, lung, and sites of arteriosclerosis, where they become active. Furthermore, oleanolic  acts on TGR5 - the cholic  receptor, as an agonist of cholic . These anti-inflammatory effects of phytochemicals have been proven by the experimental animal studies and the clinical trials.It is expected the new health food products will be created from grape skins and seeds since grape phytochemicals participate in the prevention of inflammatory diseases like intestine-related inflammatory diseases.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31165837>Sinapine reduces non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in mice by modulating the composition of the gut microbiota.</a></h2><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is associated with low-grade chronic inflammation and intestinal . In this study, we investigated the potential benefits of sinapine, a rapeseed polyphenol known to exert anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant effects, on high-fat diet (HFD)-induced NAFLD in C57BL/6 J mice and the underlying mechanisms. Four week-old mice were randomly divided into four groups and fed a low-fat diet (LFD), a HFD, a HFD with common rapeseed oil (HFD + CRO) and a HFD with sinapine in rapeseed oil (HFD + SRO) for 12 weeks.

The microbiota also interacts with and metabolizes compounds produced by the host, such as primary bile . Lactate and bile  (BA) are of particular interest in gastrointestinal diseases because they have been associated with metabolic acidosis and bile  diarrhea, respectively. The objectives of this study were to validate an enzymatic assay to quantify D-, L-, and total lactate in canine feces, and to characterize fecal lactate and BA concentrations as well as bacterial abundances in healthy dogs and dogs with gastrointestinal diseases. Fecal samples were collected from 34 healthy dogs, 15 dogs with chronic enteropathy (CE), and 36 dogs with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI). Lactate was quantified with an enzymatic assay, BA with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, and 11 bacterial groups with qPCR. A fecal lactate reference interval was established from 34 healthy dogs and was 0.7-1.4 mM, 0.3-6.0 mM, and 1.0-7.0 mM for D-, L-, and total lactate, respectively. The assay to measure D-, L-, and total lactate in canine fecal samples was linear, accurate, precise, and reproducible. Significant increases in fecal lactate and decreases in secondary BA concentrations were observed in dogs with CE and dogs with EPI. Dogs with EPI had an increased abundance of Escherichia coli, Lactobacillus, and Bifidobacterium; a decreased abundance of Fusobacterium and Clostridium hiranonis; and a higher  Index when compared to healthy dogs.

The study explored changes in the faecal microbiota and short-chain fatty  (SCFA) associated with the diet (including nonnutritive sweeteners (NNSs)) and evaluated metabolic consequences in subjects with morbid obesity. The diet was assessed with a validated food frequency questionnaire. One unit of NNSs was 100 mL beverage with NNSs or 2 tablets/teaspoons of NNSs. The faecal microbiota was assessed with GA-map®  test and SCFA with gas chromatography and flame ionisation detection. Fourteen men and 75 women with a mean age of 44.6 (SD 8.7) years, BMI 41.8 (SD 3.6) kg/m, and intake of NNSs 7.5 units/day (SD 3.2; range 0-43) were included. Faecal butyric  was positively and negatively associated with the intake of starch (partial correlation = 0.264; =0.015) and NNSs (partial correlation = -0.274; =0.011), respectively. NNSs were associated with changes in four out of 39 bacterial groups. Butyric  has antiobesogenic effects, reduces insulin resistance, and improves dyslipidaemia. Since the weight-reducing effect of NNSs on obese adults trying to lose weight is dubious, it seems imprudent to use NNSs that might counteract the favourable effects of butyric .Copyright © 2019 Per G.

In this study, therefore, we investigated changes in the gut microbiome and metabolome in serum and hippocampus between advanced-stage T1D (AST1D) rats with cognitive decline and age-matched controls (AMC), and explored the possible mechanism of the gut-microbiota-metabolite axis in T1D-induced cognitive dysfunction. The results demonstrated that AST1D rats possessed peculiar metabolic phenotypes in serum and hippocampus relative to AMC rats, as characterized by decreases in tricarboxylic  (TCA) cycle and amino  and choline metabolism as well as disturbances in glutamate/GABA-glutamine cycle and astrocyte-neuron metabolism. We also found that AST1D rats had higher relative abundances of Prevotella_9, Bacteroides and Lachnospiraceae_NK4A136_group as well as lower relative abundances of Clostridium_sensu_stricto_1, Romboutsia and Turicibacter than AMC rats. Microbiota-host metabolic correlation analysis suggests that metabolic alterations in serum and hippocampus may be modulated by the gut microbiota, especially Clostridium_sensu_stricto_1, Romboutsia and Turicibacter. Therefore, our study implies that the modification of host metabolism by targeting the gut microbiota may be a novel avenue for prevention and treatment of diabetic encephalopathy in the future.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, we aimed to unravel the role of both intestinal barrier integrity and microbiota in NAFLD/NASH development.C57BL/6J mice were fed with high-fat diet (HFD) or methionine-choline-deficient diet for 1 week or longer to recapitulate aspects of NASH (steatosis, inflammation, insulin resistance). Genetic and pharmacological strategies were then used to modulate intestinal barrier integrity.We show that disruption of the intestinal epithelial barrier and gut vascular barrier (GVB) are early events in NASH pathogenesis. Mice fed HFD for only 1 week undergo a diet-induced  that drives GVB damage and bacterial translocation into the liver. Fecal microbiota transplantation from HFD-fed mice into specific pathogen-free recipients induces GVB damage and epididymal adipose tissue enlargement. GVB disruption depends on interference with the WNT/β-catenin signaling pathway, as shown by genetic intervention driving β-catenin activation only in endothelial cells, preventing GVB disruption and NASH development. The bile  analogue and farnesoid X receptor agonist obeticholic  (OCA) drives β-catenin activation in endothelial cells. Accordingly, pharmacologic intervention with OCA protects against GVB disruption, both as a preventive and therapeutic agent. Importantly, we found upregulation of the GVB leakage marker in the colon of patients with NASH.We have identified a new player in NASH development, the GVB, whose damage leads to bacteria or bacterial product translocation into the blood circulation. Treatment aimed at restoring β-catenin activation in endothelial cells, such as administration of OCA, protects against GVB damage and NASH development.The incidence of fatty liver disease is reaching epidemic levels in the USA, with more than 30% of adults having NAFLD (non-alcoholic fatty liver disease), which can progress to more severe non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Herein, we show that disruption of the intestinal epithelial barrier and gut vascular barrier are early events in the development of NASH. We show that the drug obeticholic  protects against barrier disruption and thereby prevents the development of NASH, providing further evidence for its use in the prevention or treatment of NASH.Copyright © 2019 European Association for the Study of the Liver.

The gut microbiota connect diet to the metabolism by producing small molecules via diverse metabolic pathways. In this study we aimed to investigate the dietary preferences of IBD patients, and to explore the interactions among gut microbiota composition, dietary components, and metabolites in relation to IBD.Dietary preferences of IBD patients (including those with ulcerative colitis [UC] and Crohn's disease [CD]) and health controls were investigated, and their gut microbiota were analyzed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and metagenomic analyses of fecal and biopsy samples. The metabolite profiles of the samples were then analyzed using gas and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analyses.The daily intake of folic , niacin, vitamins C and D, calcium, and selenium differed significantly between patients with IBD and healthy controls. A decrease in long-chain (such as arachidic, and oleic ) and medium-chain fatty  (sebacic  and isocaproic ) as well as bile  was observed in patients with IBD. Compared with healthy controls, 22 microbial species (including Sulfolobus acidocaldarius, and Clostridium clostridioforme CAG132) in the UC group and 37 microbial species (such as Bacteroides fragilis and Fusobacterium nucleatum) in the CD group were found to be correlated to diet and metabolites. Bacteroides fragilis was enriched in patients with IBD and associated with multi-nutrients, and 21 metabolites including 25-hydroxyvitamin D and taurolithocholic .This study provides an interaction network to identify key micronutrients, microbiota components and metabolites that contribute to IBD.© 2019 Chinese Medical Association Shanghai Branch, Chinese Society of Gastroenterology, Renji Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31513213>Supplementation of okra seed oil ameliorates ethanol-induced liver injury and modulates gut microbiota  in mice.</a></h2><p>This aim of this study is to assess the possible effects of dietary okra seed oil (OSO) consumption on attenuation of alcohol-induced liver damage and gut microbiota , and associated mechanisms in mice. Mice were orally administered alcohol alone or in combination with OSO at 400 and 800 mg per kg bw for 8 weeks. OSO caused a strong inhibition of abnormal weight loss and liver fat accumulation in alcohol-administered mice. Malonaldehyde production was also effectively antagonized, and glutathione peroxidase and superoxide dismutase activities were elevated by OSO treatment in ethanol-based mice (p < 0.05). Concentrations of hepatic TNF-α, IL-1 and IL-6 were decreased after OSO treatment when compared with alcohol-treated mice, respectively (p < 0.05). As revealed by 16S rDNA gene sequence analysis, OSO notably reduced the Proteobacteria proportion and enhanced the Bacteroidetes population of alcohol-treated mice, and a significant reduction in Clostridium XlVa and Staphylococcus was observed, revealing that OSO attenuated the alcohol-induced gut . OSO also attenuated lipid metabolic disorder by modulating metabolism of serum free fatty  in ethanol-based mice, but had no significant difference in cecum total short-chain fatty  among the tested mice. Amelioration of these parameters and liver injury via H&E staining examination demonstrated that OSO consumption could effectively protect against liver damage and maintain intestinal eubiosis in mice.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31448571>Alterations in the human gut microbiome in anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor encephalitis.</a></h2><p>To explore the diversity and composition of the fecal microbiota in patients with anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis.We enrolled 10 patients in the acute stage with naïve treatment, seven patients with relapse, 13 patients without relapse in the remission phase, and 12 paired healthy controls. The fecal microbiota in different groups was compared by 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) gene pyrosequencing.Prominent  in the gut microbiome of patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis was found. Our primary findings showed that the overall species richness (alpha diversity indexes) of the microbiota was higher in patients than in controls (P < 0.05). Distance-based community analysis revealed that the microbiota differed substantially within all subgroups of patients and controls (P < 0.05). The relative abundance of species heatmap showed a tendency toward depletion for some commensal genera, such as Prevotella_6, Bifidobacterium, Faecalibacterium, and other short-chain fatty  (SCFA)-producing bacteria. Additionally, our results showed that all subgroups had a distinct bacterial species, with an increase in the genus Fusobacterium in the acute phase group and the genera Streptococcus and Parabacteroides in patients with relapse. However, the genus Bacteroides was very abundant in patients without relapse. Although the findings regarding the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes (F/B) ratios across the four comparison groups were not statistically significant, the F/B ratio gradually increased in patients from the acute phase group (0.87), to the disease remission group with relapse (1.06), to the group without relapse (1.28), to the healthy group (1.63).Patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis exhibit a substantial alteration in fecal microbiota composition.© 2019 The Authors.

Many studies have demonstrated that the microbiome is closely associated with the progression of nutrition-related diseases, especially of fatty liver disease. Changes in the quantity and quality of the intestinal flora, commonly referred to as , result in altered food metabolism, increased permeability of the intestinal barrier ("leaky gut") and consecutive inflammatory processes in the liver. This favors both the progression of obesity and metabolic disorders as well as NAFLD towards non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), hepatic fibrosis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Important molecular mechanisms include microbial metabolites, microbial and endogenous signaling substances (so-called PAMPs/DAMPs) as well as bile . Essential cellular mechanisms include immune cells in the gut and liver, especially macrophages and Kupffer cells, as well as intestinal epithelial cells and hepatocytes as central regulators of metabolism. In this review article, we briefly summarize the relevant species of the human microbiome, describe the microbial analytics, explain the most important molecular relationships between microbiome and NAFLD/NASH, and finally the opportunities and challenges of microbiome-modulating therapy for the treatment of fatty liver disease.© Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31451009>Improvement of Lipoprotein Profile and Metabolic Endotoxemia by a Lifestyle Intervention That Modifies the Gut Microbiota in Subjects With Metabolic Syndrome.</a></h2><p>Background Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a serious health problem over the world; thus, the aim of the present work was to develop a lifestyle intervention to decrease the  of gut microbiota and reduce the biochemical abnormalities of MetS. Methods and Results The prevalence of MetS was evaluated in 1065 subjects of Mexico City, Mexico, and the gut microbiota in a subsample. Subjects with MetS were selected for a pragmatic study based on a lifestyle intervention with a low-saturated-fat diet, reduced-energy intake, with functional foods and physical activity, and a second group was selected for a randomized control-placebo study to assess the gut microbiota after the dietary intervention. Prevalence of MetS was 53%, and the higher the body mass index, the higher the gut microbiota . The higher the Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance, the lower the high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration. The pragmatic study revealed that after 15 days on a low-saturated-fat diet, there was a 24% reduction in serum triglycerides; and after a 75-day lifestyle intervention, MetS was reduced by 44.8%, with a reduction in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, small low-density lipoprotein particles, glucose intolerance, lipopolysaccharide, and branched-chain amino . The randomized control-placebo study showed that after the lifestyle intervention, there was a decrease in the  of the gut microbiota associated with a reduction in the Prevotella/ Bacteroides ratio and an increase in the abundance of Akkermansia muciniphila and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii. Conclusions A lifestyle intervention significantly decreased MetS components, small low-density lipoprotein particle concentration, gut microbiota , and metabolic endotoxemia, reducing the risk of atherosclerosis.

It is estimated that approximately 75% of treatment-resistant hypertension cases have an underlying OSA. Exploration of the gut  is a new advance in medicine that has been linked to many comorbid illnesses, including SH and OSA. Here, we will review the literature in SH and gut dysbiosis, OSA and gut dysbiosis, and whether gut dysbiosis is common in both conditions.We reviewed the National Center for Biotechnology Information database, including PubMed and PubMed Central. We identified a total of 230 articles. The literature search was conducted using the phrase "obstructive sleep apnea and gut dysbiosis." Only original research articles were included. This yielded a total of 12 articles.Most of the research conducted in this field was on animal models, and almost all trials confirmed that intermittent hypoxia models resulted in gut dysbiosis. Gut dysbiosis, however, can cause a state of low-grade inflammation through damage to the gut wall barrier resulting in "leaky gut." Neuroinflammation is a hallmark of the pathophysiology of OSA-induced SH.Gut dysbiosis seems to be an important factor in the pathophysiology of OSA-induced hypertension. Reversing gut dysbiosis at an early stage through prebiotics and probiotics and fecal  transplantation combined with positive airway pressure therapy may open new horizons of treatment to prevent SH. More studies are needed in humans to elicit the effect of positive airway pressure therapy on gut dysbiosis.© 2019 American Academy of Sleep Medicine.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31005320>Adaptive responses in short-chain fatty  absorption, gene expression, and bacterial community of the bovine rumen epithelium recovered from a continuous or transient high-grain feeding.</a></h2><p>The feeding of high-grain diets to dairy cows commonly results in lowered pH and ruminal , characterized by changes in absorption dynamics of short-chain fatty  (SCFA) across the reticuloruminal wall, epithelial function, and the epithelial bacteria community structure. Therefore, the present study evaluated the effect of high-grain feeding persistence on the absorption kinetics of reticuloruminal SCFA, gene expression in the rumen epithelium, and the associated shifts in the epithelial bacteria in cows recovering from either a long-term continuous high-grain feeding model or a long-term transient high-grain feeding model. In a crossover study design, 8 nonlactating Holstein cows were fed 60% concentrate either continuously for 4 wk (continuous) or with a 1-wk break in the second week of the high-grain feeding (transient). After the high-grain feeding, all animals were fed a diet of 100% forage (recovery) for an additional 8 wk. Rumen papilla biopsies and SCFA absorption measurements were taken at the start of the trial (baseline), after the 4-wk high-grain feeding (49 d), after 2-wk recovery forage feeding (63 d), and after 8-wk recovery forage (105 d). Absorption of SCFA was determined in vivo using the washed and isolated reticulorumen technique. Rumen papillae biopsies were used for adherent bacterial DNA and host RNA extraction. The epithelial bacteria were determined using Illumina MiSeq (Microsynth AG, Balgach, Switzerland) sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene. No significant effects of the high-grain feeding model were seen for bacterial diversity. However, bacterial diversity increased with time spent in the recovery forage feeding period regardless of feeding model. The relative abundance of Acidobacteria phyla and Acetivibrio spp. increased when animals were fed a transient high-grain feeding model. A trend toward increased CLDN4 expression was observed in the continuous model. Furthermore, there were interactions between feeding model and sampling day for gene targets CD14, DRA, NHE2, NHE3, and MCT2. When comparing length of recovery, in the continuous model increased relative absorption of SCFA was sustained at 63 d but dropped to baseline measurements at 105 d. A similar pattern was found with the transient model but it did not reach significance. The only gene target that was found to significantly correlate to relative absorption of SCFA was DRA (correlation coefficient ≤ -0.41). Whereas, genera Alkalibaculum, Anaerorhabdus, Coprococcus, and Dethiobacter all showed positive correlations to gene targets for pH regulation (NHE2 and NHE3) and SCFA uptake (MCT1) but negative correlations to SCFA absorption. We conclude that while the rumen absorption and epithelial bacteria were able to recover to baseline levels after 8 wk of forage feeding, the time needed for re-establishment of homeostasis in host gene expression is longer, especially when high-grain feeding is interrupted.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

Here, we show that indole-3-propionic  (IPA), a tryptophan metabolite produced by gut bacteria, is a potent anti-non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) microbial metabolite. Here, we demonstrate that administration of IPA modulates the microbiota composition in the gut and inhibits microbial  in rats fed a high-fat diet. IPA induces the expression of tight junction proteins, such as ZO-1 and Occludin, and maintains intestinal epithelium homeostasis, leading to a reduction in plasma endotoxin levels. Interestingly, IPA inhibits NF-κB signaling and reduces the levels of proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNFα, IL-1β, and IL-6, in response to endotoxin in macrophages to repress hepatic inflammation and liver injury. Moreover, IPA is sufficient to inhibit the expression of fibrogenic and collagen genes and attenuate diet-induced NASH phenotypes. The beneficial effects of IPA on the liver are likely mediated through inhibiting the production of endotoxin in the gut. These findings suggest a protective role of IPA in the control of metabolism and uncover the gut microbiome and liver cross-talk in regulating the intestinal microenvironment and liver pathology via a novel dietary nutrient metabolite. IPA may provide a new therapeutic strategy for treating NASH.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31317818>Biomarkers of intestinal barrier function in multiple sclerosis are associated with disease activity.</a></h2><p>Recent evidence suggests a role for the gut-brain axis in the pathophysiology of multiple sclerosis (MS).We studied biomarkers of intestinal permeability in 126 people with MS (57 relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) and 69 progressive MS) and in a group of healthy controls for comparison. Serum/plasma concentrations of zonulin (a regulator of enterocyte tight junctions), tight junction proteins (ZO-1 and occludin), intestinal fatty  binding protein (IFABP)/ileal bile  binding protein (IBABP), D-lactate, and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) binding protein were measured.Zonulin concentrations were significantly higher when a concurrent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmed the presence of blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption (Gad+ RRMS) and were correlated with tight junction proteins. IBABP and D-lactate were elevated in people with RRMS compared to controls, but did not discriminate between Gad+ and Gad- subgroups. Baseline zonulin concentrations were associated with 1-year disease progression in progressive MS.People with MS have altered biomarkers of intestinal barrier integrity. Zonulin concentrations are associated with 1-year disease progression in progressive MS and closely mirror BBB breakdown in RRMS. Zonulin may mediate breakdown of both the intestinal barrier and the BBB in gut  through the regulation of tight junctions.

We performed a systematic review using the PubMed/Medline database including primary articles written in English that measured leptin production or levels as well as SCFA used as an intervention, mechanism or outcome. The search yielded a total of 573 citations; 36 studies were included in the final analysis. The quality of the studies was analyzed through two validated tools based on objective criteria. Overall, the studies presented low risk of bias to construct and statistical validity. However, the majority presented a high risk of attrition and detection bias. In vitro studies (n = 8) consistently demonstrated that SCFA stimulate leptin expression in adipocytes through activation of free fatty  receptor 3 (FFAR3). In animal studies (n = 24), interventions to modulate high-fat diet outcomes predominantly caused a decrease in circulating leptin levels and increased SCFA, associated with suppressed weight gain. Control of  through administration of prebiotics and probiotics also played a role in leptin synthesis in animal studies. In human studies (n = 4) leptin was mainly correlated with adiposity but  interfered with this relationship. We conclude that the association between SCFA and leptin remains incompletely understood but occurs mainly through the activation of FFAR3 in adipocytes. However, body fat rather than SCFA remains the main driver for leptin synthesis in vivo. Future studies should aim to better clarify the role of SCFA in regulating leptin production in vivo.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The objective of this brief research report was to use a well-establish malabsorption model in broiler chickens using corn and rye as an energy source to identify several intestinal health biomarkers in the serum. To screen for inflammatory biomarkers, seven commercially available tests were used including Griess, superoxide dismutase, thiobarbituric  reactive substances, Total antioxidant capacity, extracellular-signal-regulated kinase, Citrulline, and Interferon-ɤ; total IgA from cloacal swab was also measured. In the present study, chickens fed rye had a significant ( < 0.05) reduction in body weight and body weight gain at 10 day when compared with chickens that received the corn diet. In the second phase of the experiment, chickens that remain with the corn diet had significant differences in body weight and body weight gain. No significant differences were observed for any of the four antioxidant biomarkers evaluated in the sera ( > 0.05). However, significant differences were observed in serum citrulline and IFN-ɤ, as well as in cloacal IgA, in broiler chickens fed with rye, suggesting their potential use as biomarkers to study intestinal inflammation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30995474>Butyrate Protects Mice from Clostridium difficile-Induced Colitis through an HIF-1-Dependent Mechanism.</a></h2><p>Antibiotic-induced  is a key factor predisposing intestinal infection by Clostridium difficile.

Combined with the Spearman's correlation analysis, it was confirmed that the increases of five bacterial strains and decreases of six bacterial strains were closely correlated with the increases of nine host metabolites and the decreases of another five host metabolites. Therefore, XAN can modulate the structure of gut  in AD rats; the changes of gut  were significantly correlated with endogenous metabolites, and symptom of AD was ultimately alleviated.

For 14 days, the normal control and colitis control groups were given tap water, kefir10 control, kefir10 colitis, and kefir30 control, and the kefir30 colitis groups were given phosphate-buffered saline containing 10% or 30% kefir, respectively, instead of tap water. Colitis was induced by intracolonically administrating TNBS in the colitis control, kefir10 colitis, and kefir30 colitis groups. On the 14th day, the rats were sacrificed. The weights and lengths of the colons were measured and macroscopically evaluated, and the distal 10 cm segments were subjected to a histopathological examination. The incidence of bloody stool and diarrhea in the kefir10 colitis group was found to be less than the colitis control and kefir30 colitis groups. The colonic weight/length ratio in the kefir10 colitis group was lower than that in the colitis control and kefir30 colitis groups. We detected that the 10% kefir treatment reduced TNBS-induced macroscopic colonic damage, while it was exacerbated by the 30% kefir treatment. No significant difference was observed between the colitis groups in terms of microscopic colonic damage scoring. These results indicate that kefir, with a careful dose selection, may be a useful agent in the treatment of IBD.© 2019 The Authors.

We recently showed that replacing corn with molassed sugar beet pulp (Bp) improved fiber degradation in high-producing dairy cattle, possibly because of an improvement of rumen and hindgut conditions for microbes by Bp feeding. However, little is known about the effects of high inclusion rates of Bp on hindgut microbes and fermentation. Thus fecal grab samples were taken from 18 high-yielding Simmental cows after 28 d of feeding 3 different levels of Bp (n = 6) for bacterial 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. In addition, the reticular pH was continuously monitored with indwelling sensors and eating and ruminating behavior was evaluated with noseband sensors. The Bp inclusion rates were 0 g/kg (i.e., no Bp inclusion as control, CON), 120 g/kg (12Bp), or 240 g/kg (24Bp) replacing corn grain and limestone on a dry matter basis. The amount of time spent eating and ruminating was unaffected by Bp level, and the daily fluctuation in the reticular pH was reduced by 25% with Bp inclusion from 0.8 in the CON diet to 0.6 in 24Bp fed animals. Also, the fecal pH tended to increase with dietary Bp inclusion. Fecal acetate production showed a quadratic tendency with the lowest concentration (58.9%) of the total short-chain fatty  in the 12Bp treatment. Inclusion of Bp up to 24% of the diet decreased the fecal butyrate proportion by 27%. The Shannon diversity index was increased from 5.50 to 8.09 with dietary Bp inclusion indicating increased species diversity. Of the 200 most abundant operational taxonomic units, 25 were increased by dietary Bp inclusion, whereas 15 were decreased and 7 were quadratically affected. The second most abundant group was proposed taxon "CF231" of the family Paraprevotellaceae. Although it accounted for only 2.52% of the operational taxonomic units in the CON diet, it was increased by 64% with dietary Bp inclusion. The largest relative change in the abundance was found for the genus Fibrobacter that increased more than 14-fold from 0.04% (CON) to 0.66% (24Bp). In conclusion, feeding molassed sugar beet pulp as partial substitution of corn up to 240 g/kg is a viable alternative that promotes ruminal and hindgut fermentation by supporting physiological pH and bacterial diversity.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

It remained largely unknown how antibiotic-induced  confers the risk for enhanced inflammatory response. The aim of the present study was to test the hypothesis that SCFAs, their receptors and transporters mediate the antibiotic long-term effects on the functional state of colonic mucosa and susceptibility to the experimental colitis. Male Wistar rats were treated daily for 14 days with antibiotic ceftriaxone (300 mg/kg, i.m.) or vehicle; euthanized by CO2 inhalation followed by cervical dislocation in 1, 14 or 56 days after antibiotic withdrawal. We found increased cecum weight and sustained changes in microbiota composition after ceftriaxone treatment with increased number of conditionally pathogenic enterobacteria, E. coli, Clostridium, Staphylococcus spp. and hemolytic bacteria even at 56 days after antibiotic withdrawal. The concentration of SCFAs was decreased after ceftriaxone withdrawal. We found decreased immunoreactivity of the FFA2, FFA3 receptors, SMCT1 and increased MCT1 & MCT4 transporters of SCFAs in colon mucosa. These changes evoked a significant shift in colonic mucosal homeostasis: the disturbance of oxidant-antioxidant balance; activation of redox-sensitive transcription factor HIF1α and ERK1/2 MAP kinase; increased colonic epithelial permeability and bacterial translocation to blood; morphological remodeling of the colonic tissue. Ceftriaxone pretreatment significantly reinforced inflammation during experimental colitis 56 days after ceftriaxone withdrawal, which was confirmed by increased histopathology of colitis, Goblet cell dysfunction, colonic dilatation and wall thickening, and increased serum levels of inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α and IL-10). Since the recognition of the importance of microbiota metabolic activity rather than their composition in the development of inflammatory disorders, e.g. IBD, the present study is the first report on the role of the SCFA system in the long lasting side effects of antibiotic treatment and its implication in IBD development.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31145129>The gut microbiota in type 1 diabetes: friend or foe?</a></h2><p>Evidence is mounting that disturbances in the gut microbiota play a role in the rising incidence of type 1 diabetes (T1D) and new technologies are expanding our ability to understand microbial function and host interactions.

One of the organs significantly affected by age is the gut. Age-dependent changes of the gut-associated microbiome have been linked to increased frailty and systemic inflammation. This change in microbial composition with age occurs in parallel with a decline in function of the gut immune system; however, it is not clear whether there is a causal link between the two. Here we report that the defective germinal centre reaction in Peyer's patches of aged mice can be rescued by faecal transfers from younger adults into aged mice and by immunisations with cholera toxin, without affecting germinal centre reactions in peripheral lymph nodes. This demonstrates that the poor germinal centre reaction in aged animals is not irreversible, and that it is possible to improve this response in older individuals by providing appropriate stimuli.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31316522>Corrigendum: Short Chain Fatty  (SCFAs)-Mediated Gut Epithelial and Immune Regulation and Its Relevance for Inflammatory Bowel Diseases.</a></h2><p>[This corrects the article DOI: 10.3389/fimmu.2019.00277.].</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31576099>Evaluation and comparison of short chain fatty  composition in gut diseases.</a></h2><p>An altered (dysbiosis) and unhealthy status of the gut  is usually responsible for a reduction of short chain fatty  (SCFAs) concentration.

We hypothesize that different intestinal diseases, such as celiac disease (CD), adenomatous polyposis (AP) and colorectal cancer (CRC) could display a particular fecal SCFAs' signature.To compare the fecal SCFAs' profiles of CD, AP, CRC patients and healthy controls, using the same analytical method.In this cross-sectional study, we defined and compared the SCFAs' concentration in fecal samples of 9 AP, 16 CD, 19 CRC patients and 16 healthy controls (HC). The SCFAs' analysis were performed using a gas-chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry method. Data analysis was carried out using Wilcoxon rank-sum test to assess pairwise differences of SCFAs' profiles, partial least squares-discriminate analysis (PLS-DA) to determine the status membership based on distinct SCFAs' profiles, and Dirichlet regression to determine factors influencing concentration levels of SCFAs.We have not observed any difference in the SCFAs' amount and composition between CD and healthy control. On the contrary, the total amount of SCFAs was significantly lower in CRC patients compared to HC ( = 0.044) and CD ( = 0.005). Moreover, the SCFAs' percentage composition was different in CRC and AP compared to HC. In detail, HC displayed higher percentage of acetic  ( value = 1.3 × 10) and a lower amount of butyric ( value = 0.02192), isobutyric ( value = 7.4 × 10), isovaleric ( value = 0.00012) and valeric ( value = 0.00014)  compared to CRC patients. AP showed a lower abundance of acetic  ( value = 0.00062) and higher percentages of propionic ( value = 0.00433) and isovaleric ( value = 0.00433)  compared to HC. Moreover, AP showed higher levels of propionic  ( value = 0.03251) and a lower level of isobutyric  ( value = 0.00427) in comparison to CRC. The PLS-DA model demonstrated a significant separation of CRC and AP groups from HC, although some degree of overlap was observed between CRC and AP.Analysis of fecal SCFAs shows the potential to provide a non-invasive means of diagnosis to detect patients with CRC and AP, while CD patients cannot be discriminated from healthy subjects.©The Author(s) 2019.

Modification of gut  and repression of BA synthesis are potential strategies for the treatment of cholestatic liver disease. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects and to understand the mechanisms of the probiotic, Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG (LGG), on hepatic bile  synthesis, liver injury and fibrosis in bile-duct ligation (BDL) and Mdr2 mice. Global and intestinal specific FXR inhibitors were used to dissect the role of FXR. LGG treatment significantly attenuated liver inflammation, injury and fibrosis with a significant reduction of hepatic BAs in BDL mice. Hepatic concentration of T-βMCA, an FXR antagonist, was markedly increased in BDL mice and reduced in LGG-treated mice, while chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA), an FXR agonist, was decreased in BDL mice and normalized in LGG-treated mice. LGG treatment significantly increased the expression of serum and ileum FGF15 and subsequently reduced hepatic CYP7A1 and BA synthesis in BDL and Mdr2 mice. At the molecular level, these changes were reversed by global and intestinal specific FXR inhibitors in BDL mice. In addition, LGG treatment altered gut , which was associated with increased BA de-conjugation and increased fecal and urine BA excretion both in BDL and Mdr2 mice. In vitro studies showed that LGG suppressed the inhibitory effect of T-βMCA on FXR and FGF19 expression in Caco-2 cells. Conclusion: LGG supplementation decreases hepatic BA by increasing intestinal FXR/FGF15 signaling pathway-mediated suppression of BA de novo synthesis and enhances BA excretion, which prevents excessive BA-induced liver injury and fibrosis in mice.© 2019 The Authors.

Because cystic fibrosis (CF) is associated with intestinal , anomalous BA handling, and biliary cirrhosis, we investigated FXR signaling in CF.Intestinal and hepatic expression of FXR target genes and inflammation markers was assessed in Cftr null mice and controls. Localization of the apical sodium-dependent BA transporter was assessed, and BAs in gastrointestinal tissues were analyzed. The CF microbiota was characterized and FXR signaling was investigated in intestinal tissue and organoids.Ileal murine fibroblast growth factor 19 ortholog (Fgf15) expression was strongly reduced in CF mice, compared with controls. Luminal BA levels and localization of apical sodium-dependent BA transporter was not affected, and BAs induced Fgf15 up to normal levels in CF ileum, ex vivo, and CF organoids. CF mice showed a  that was associated with a marked up-regulation of genes involved in host-microbe interactions, including those involved in mucin glycosylation, antimicrobial defense, and Toll-like receptor signaling. Antibiotic treatment reversed the up-regulation of inflammatory markers and restored intestinal FXR signaling in CF mice. Conversely, FXR-dependent gene induction in ileal tissue and organoids was repressed by bacterial lipopolysaccharide and proinflammatory cytokines, respectively. Loss of intestinal FXR activity was associated with a markedly blunted hepatic trophic response to oral BA supplementation, and with impaired repression of Cyp7a1, the gene encoding the rate-limiting enzyme in BA synthesis.In CF mice, the gut microbiota represses intestinal FXR activity, and, consequently, FXR-dependent hepatic cell proliferation and feedback control of BA synthesis.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Many ENMs have historically been shown to possess antimicrobial properties, which has sparked concern for how dietary nanomaterials impact gastrointestinal health via microbial . We employed an in vitro Human Gut Simulator system to examine interactions of dietary nano titanium dioxide (TiO2) with human gut microbiota. Electron microscopy indicated a close association of TiO2 particles with bacterial cells. Addition of TiO2 to microbial communities led to a modest reduction in community density but had no impact on community diversity and evenness. In contrast, administration of known antimicrobial silver nanoparticles in a control experiment resulted in a drastic reduction of population density. In both cases, communities recovered once the addition of nanomaterials was ceased. Constrained ordination analysis of community profiles revealed that simulated colonic region was the primary determinant of microbiota composition. Accordingly, predicted community functional capacity and measured production of short chain fatty  were not changed significantly upon microbiota exposure to TiO2. We conclude that tested TiO2 nanoparticles have limited direct effect on human gut microbiota.© The Author(s) 2019. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society of Toxicology.

DDS-1 treatment increased the abundances of beneficial bacteria such as  spp. and  spp. more effectively in caecal samples than in mucosal samples. DDS-1 also enhanced the levels of butyrate, while downregulating the production of inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-1β, IL-1α, MCP-1, MIP-1α, MIP-1β, IL-12 and IFN-γ) in serum and colonic explants.

These changes, especially concerning hygiene, have led to a marked decrease in some diseases, i.e., infectious diseases. However, other diseases that can be attributed to the so-called 'Western' lifestyle have increased, i.e., metabolic and cardiovascular disorders. More recently, multifactorial disorders, such as autoimmune and neurodegenerative diseases, have been associated with changes in diet and the gut microbiome. In particular, short chain fatty  (SCFA)-producing bacteria are of high interest. SCFAs are the main metabolites produced by bacteria and are often reduced in a dysbiotic state, causing an inflammatory environment. Based on advanced technologies, high-resolution investigations of the abundance and composition of the commensal microbiome are now possible. These techniques enable the assessment of the relationship between the gut microbiome, its metabolome and gut-associated immune and neuronal cells. While a growing number of studies have shown the indirect impact of gut metabolites, mediated by alterations of immune-mediated mechanisms, the direct influence of these compounds on cells of the central nervous system needs to be further elucidated. For instance, the SCFA propionic  (PA) increases the amount of intestine-derived regulatory T cells, which furthermore can positively affect the central nervous system (CNS), e.g., by increasing remyelination. However, the question of if and how PA can directly interact with CNS-resident cells is a matter of debate.

Then we investigated the shift in gut microbiota 2 weeks after the Kasai procedure in 16 BA patients. Gut microbiome was initially analyzed using 16S ribosome RNA gene sequencing and further validated by metagenomic sequencing. Fecal bile  were determined using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography.Compared with healthy controls, BA showed lower diversity and significant structural segregation in the microbiome. At phylum level, Proteobacteria numbers increased, whereas those of Bacteroidetes decreased in BA. At genus level, several potential pathogens such as Streptococcus and Klebsiella thrived in BA, while numbers for Bifidobacterium and several butyrate-producing bacteria declined. The microbiome was also disturbed after the Kasai procedure. Operational taxonomic units responding to BA showed significant correlation with liver function. Furthermore, the abundance ratio of Streptococcus/Bacteroides showed great promise in distinguishing BA from healthy controls. Intestinal bile  were dramatically decreased in BA, and Clostridium XIVa positively correlated with the ratio of primary/secondary bile .Gut microbial , may be caused by decreased bile , was associated with liver function and had a good diagnostic potential for BA.

Levels of histidine and butyrate metabolites were significantly reduced in children with rhinitis (P = 0.029) and asthma (P = 0.009), respectively. In children with asthma, a reduction in butyrate-producing bacteria, including Faecalibacterium and Roseburia spp., and an increase in Clostridium spp. were negatively correlated with fecal amino  and butyrate, respectively (P < 0.01). Increased Escherichia spp. accompanied by increased β-alanine and 4-hydroxybutyrate appeared to reduce butyrate production. Low fecal butyrate was significantly associated with increased total serum and mite allergen-specific IgE levels in children with asthma (P < 0.05).A reduced fecal butyrate is associated with increased mite-specific IgE levels and the risk of asthma in early childhood.

A Microbial Community Model Based on Functional Genes.</a></h2><p>Exploring the mechanisms of maintaining microbial community structure is important to understand biofilm development or microbiota . In this paper, we propose a functional gene-based composition prediction (FCP) model to predict the population structure composition within a microbial community. The model predicts the community composition well in both a low-complexity community as  mine drainage (AMD) microbiota, and a complex community as human gut microbiota. Furthermore, we define community structure shaping (CSS) genes as functional genes crucial for shaping the microbial community. We have identified CSS genes in AMD and human gut microbiota samples with FCP model and find that CSS genes change with the conditions. Compared to essential genes for microbes, CSS genes are significantly enriched in the genes involved in mobile genetic elements, cell motility, and defense mechanisms, indicating that the functions of CSS genes are focused on communication and strategies in response to the environment factors. We further find that it is the minority, rather than the majority, which contributes to maintaining community structure. Compared to health control samples, we find that some functional genes associated with metabolism of amino , nucleotides, and lipopolysaccharide are more likely to be CSS genes in the disease group. CSS genes may help us to understand critical cellular processes and be useful in seeking addable gene circuitries to maintain artificial self-sustainable communities. Our study suggests that functional genes are important to the assembly of microbial communities.Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Production and hosting by Elsevier B.V.

Mexico is no exception, and therefore the Asociación Mexicana de Gastroenterología brought together a multidisciplinary group (gastroenterologists, endoscopists, internists, infectious disease specialists, and microbiologists) to carry out the "Consensus on the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of Clostridium difficile infection", establishing useful recommendations (in relation to the adult population) for the medical community. Said recommendations are presented herein. Among them, it was recognized that CDI should be suspected in subjects with diarrhea that have a history of antibiotic and/or immunosuppressant use, but that it can also be a community-acquired infection. A 2-step diagnostic algorithm was proposed, in which a highly sensitive test, such as glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH), is first utilized, and if positive, confirmed by the detection of toxins through immunoassay or nucleic  detection tests. Another recommendation was that CDI based on clinical evaluation be categorized as mild-moderate, severe, and complicated severe, given that such a classification enables better therapeutic decisions to be made. In mild-moderate CDI, oral vancomycin is the medication of choice, and metronidazole is recommended as an alternative treatment. In addition, fecal microbiota transplantation was recognized as an efficacious option in patients with recurrence or in the more severe cases of infection, and surgery should be reserved for patients with severe colitis (toxic megacolon), in whom all medical treatment has failed.Copyright © 2019 Asociación Mexicana de Gastroenterología.

Fasted serum was collected from 49 participants (41 women) and analyzed by HPLC-MS/MS to quantify 45 sphingolipids. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing of stool was performed to profile the gut .Confirming the link to deteriorated glucose homeostasis, serum ceramides were positively correlated with fasting glucose, but inversely correlated with fasting and OGTT-derived measures of insulin sensitivity and β-cell function. Significant associations with gut dysbiosis were demonstrated, with SM and ceramides being inversely correlated with gene richness. Ceramides with fatty  chain lengths of 20-24 carbons were the most associated with low richness. Diet-induced weight loss, which improved gene richness, decreased most sphingolipids. Thirty-one MGS, mostly corresponding to unidentified bacteria species, were inversely correlated with ceramides, including a number of Bifidobacterium and Methanobrevibacter smithii.

Intermediary metabolism is influenced by the intestinal microbiome. To test the hypothesis that PBDEs reduce host-beneficial intermediary metabolites in an intestinal microbiome-dependent manner, 9-week old male conventional (CV) and germ-free (GF) C57BL/6 mice were orally gavaged once daily with vehicle, BDE-47, or BDE-99 (100 mol/kg) for 4 days. Intestinal microbiome (16S rDNA sequencing), liver transcriptome (RNA-Seq), and intermediary metabolites in serum, liver, as well as small and large intestinal contents (SIC and LIC; LC-MS) were examined. Changes in intermediary metabolite abundances in serum, liver, and SIC, were observed under basal conditions (CV vs. GF mice) and by PBDE exposure. PBDEs altered the largest number of metabolites in the LIC; most were regulated by PBDEs in GF conditions. Importantly, intestinal microbiome was necessary for PBDE-mediated decreases in branched-chain and aromatic amino  metabolites, including 3-indolepropionic , a tryptophan metabolite recently shown to be protective against inflammation and diabetes. Gene-metabolite networks revealed a positive association between the hepatic glycan synthesis gene -1,6-mannosyltransferase (Alg12) mRNA and mannose, which are important for protein glycosylation.

The aim of the present study was to explore the association of BCAAs with incident hypertension in a prospective population-based cohort study. We measured plasma concentrations of BCAAs by means of nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy in 4169 participants from the PREVEND (Prevention of Renal and Vascular End-stage Disease) study. We estimated the risk of incident hypertension using multivariable-adjusted Cox regression models. After a median follow-up of 8.6 years, incident hypertension was ascertained in 924 subjects. Cox regression analyses revealed a significant association between BCAAs and incident hypertension. The hazard ratio per one SD of BCAAs was 1.11 (95% CI, 1.02-1.20; 0.01) after full adjustment for multiple clinical variables. Likewise, the fully adjusted association remained significant when evaluated as categorical variable (hazard ratio for upper quartile with lowest quartile as reference category, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.11-1.68; 0.003). Furthermore, the net reclassification improvement assessment improved after addition of BCAAs to a traditional risk model (<0.001). This prospective study revealed that high plasma concentrations of BCAAs are associated with an increased risk of newly developed hypertension. The association remained after adjusting for age, sex, body mass index, and lipid profile.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31447793>Infectious Threats, the Intestinal Barrier, and Its Trojan Horse: .</a></h2><p>The ecosystem of the gut microbiota consists of diverse intestinal species with multiple metabolic and immunologic activities and it is closely connected with the intestinal epithelia and mucosal immune response, with which it builds a complex barrier against intestinal pathogenic bacteria. The microbiota ensures the integrity of the gut barrier through multiple mechanisms, either by releasing antibacterial molecules (bacteriocins) and anti-inflammatory short-chain fatty  or by activating essential cell receptors for the immune response. Experimental studies have confirmed the role of the intestinal microbiota in the epigenetic modulation of the gut barrier through posttranslational histone modifications and regulatory mechanisms induced by epithelial miRNA in the epithelial lumen. Any quantitative or functional changes of the intestinal microbiota, referred to as , alter the immune response, decrease epithelial permeability and destabilize intestinal homeostasis. Consequently, the overgrowth of pathobionts (, and Escherichia ) favors intestinal translocations with Gram negative bacteria or their endotoxins and could trigger sepsis, septic shock, secondary peritonitis, or various intestinal infections. Intestinal infections also induce epithelial lesions and perpetuate the risk of bacterial translocation and  through epithelial ischemia and pro-inflammatory cytokines. Furthermore, the decline of protective anaerobic bacteria ( and ) and inadequate release of immune modulators (such as butyrate) affects the release of antimicrobial peptides, de-represses microbial virulence factors and alters the innate immune response. As a result, intestinal germs modulate liver pathology and represent a common etiology of infections in HIV immunosuppressed patients. Antibiotic and antiretroviral treatments also promote intestinal , followed by the selection of resistant germs which could later become a source of infections. The current article addresses the strong correlations between the intestinal barrier and the microbiota and discusses the role of  in destabilizing the intestinal barrier and promoting infectious diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31341422>Role of Bile  in  and Treatment of Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease.</a></h2><p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a major health threat around the world and is characterized by .

Here, we sought to perform the first direct survey of gut microbial  over a range of apnea-hypopnea indices (AHI) among patients with OSAHS. We obtained fecal samples from 93 patients with OSAHS [5 < AHI ≤ 15 (=40), 15 < AHI ≤ 30 (=23), and AHI ≥ 30 (=30)] and 20 controls (AHI ≤ 5) and determined the microbiome composition via 16S rRNA pyrosequencing and bioinformatics analysis of variable regions 3-4. We measured fasting levels of homocysteine (HCY), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α). Results revealed gut microbial  in several patients with varying severities of OSAHS, reliably separating them from controls with a receiver operating characteristic-area under the curve (ROC-AUC) of 0.789. Functional analysis in the microbiomes of patients revealed alterations; additionally, decreased in short-chain fatty  (SCFA)-producing bacteria and increased pathogens, accompanied by elevated levels of IL-6.  levels correlated with HCY levels. Stratification analysis revealed that the  enterotype posed the highest risk for patients with OSAHS.

Heavily glycosylated mucin establishes a first-line barrier against pathogens and serves as a niche for microbial growth.To elucidate relationships among , abnormal mucin utilisation, and microbial metabolic dysfunction, we analysed short-chain fatty  (SCFAs) and mucin components in stool samples of 40 healthy subjects, 49 ulcerative colitis (UC) patients, and 44 Crohn's disease (CD) patients from Japan.Levels of n-butyrate were significantly lower in stools of both CD and UC patients than in stools of healthy subjects. Correlation analysis identified seven bacterial species positively correlated with n-butyrate levels; the major n-butyrate producer, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, was particularly underrepresented in CD patients, but not in UC patients. In UC patients, there were inverse correlations between mucin O-glycan levels and the production of SCFAs, such as n-butyrate, suggesting that mucin O-glycans serve as an endogenous fermentation substrate for n-butyrate production. Indeed, mucin-fed rodents exhibited enhanced n-butyrate production, leading to the expansion of RORgtTreg cells and IgA-producing cells in colonic lamina propria. Microbial utilisation of mucin-associated O-glycans was significantly reduced in n-butyrate-deficient UC patients.Mucin O-glycans facilitate symbiosynthesis of n-butyrate by gut microbiota.

In this study, newly weaned (3 week) and adult (8 week) male rats fed a normal- or high- fat diet were chronically exposed to 0.3 mg chlorpyrifos/kg bodyweight/day. The effects of chlorpyrifos exposure on serum hormone levels, proinflammatory cytokines and gut microbiota were evaluated. Chronic exposure to chlorpyrifos significantly decreased the concentrations of luteinizing hormone, follicule stimulating hormone and testosterone, which was found only in the normal-fat diet. The counteracted effect of high-fat diet was also found in gut hormones and proinflammatory cytokines. Significantly higher concentrations of glucagon-like peptide-1, pancreatic polypeptide, peptide tyrosine tyrosine (PYY), ghrelin, gastric inhibitory poly-peptide, IL-6, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, and TNF-α were found in rats exposed to chlorpyrifos beginning at newly weaned, whereas only the PYY, ghrelin and IL-6 concentrations increased significantly in rats exposed in adulthood. Furthermore, a decrease in epinephrine induced by chlorpyrifos exposure was found in rats exposed to chlorpyrifos beginning at newly weaned, regardless of their diet. Chlorpyrifos-induced disturbances in the microbiome community structure were more apparent in rats fed a high-fat diet and exposed beginning at newly weaned. The affected bacteria included short-chain fatty -producing bacteria (Romboutsia, Turicibacter, Clostridium sensu stricto 1, norank_f_Coriobacteriaceae, Faecalibaculum, Parasutterella and norank_f__Erysipelotrichaceae), testosterone-related genus (Turicibacter, Brevibacterium), pathogenic bacteria (Streptococcus), and inflammation-related bacteria (unclassified_f__Ruminococcaceae, Ruminococcaceae_UCG-009, Parasutterella, Oscillibacter), which regulated the endocrine system via the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, as well as the immune response and gut barrier. Early exposure accelerated the endocrine-disturbing effect and immune responses of chlorpyrifos, although these effects can be eased or recovered by a high-fat diet.

Here we investigated whether L. crispatus strains isolated from the vaginal tract of women with Lactobacillus-dominated vaginal microbiota (LVM) are pheno- or genotypically distinct from L. crispatus strains isolated from vaginal samples with dysbiotic vaginal microbiota (DVM).We studied 33 L. crispatus strains (n = 16 from LVM; n = 17 from DVM). Comparison of these two groups of strains showed that, although strain differences existed, both groups degraded various carbohydrates, produced similar amounts of organic , inhibited Neisseria gonorrhoeae growth, and did not produce biofilms. Comparative genomics analyses of 28 strains (n = 12 LVM; n = 16 DVM) revealed a novel, 3-fragmented glycosyltransferase gene that was more prevalent among strains isolated from DVM. Most L. crispatus strains showed growth on glycogen-supplemented growth media. Strains that showed less-efficient (n = 6) or no (n = 1) growth on glycogen all carried N-terminal deletions (respectively, 29 and 37 amino  deletions) in a putative pullulanase type I protein.L. crispatus strains isolated from LVM were not phenotypically distinct from L. crispatus strains isolated from DVM; however, the finding that the latter were more likely to carry a 3-fragmented glycosyltransferase gene may indicate a role for cell surface glycoconjugates, which may shape vaginal microbiota-host interactions. Furthermore, the observation that variation in the pullulanase type I gene is associated with growth on glycogen discourages previous claims that L. crispatus cannot directly utilize glycogen.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31235994>Proton pump inhibitors and : Current knowledge and aspects to be clarified.</a></h2><p>Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are common medications within the practice of gastroenterology.

PPIs are generally well tolerated but, through the long-term reduction of gastric  secretion, can increase the risk of an imbalance in gut microbiota composition (., ). The gut microbiota is a complex ecosystem in which microbes coexist and interact with the human host. Indeed, the resident gut bacteria are needed for multiple vital functions, such as nutrient and drug metabolism, the production of energy, defense against pathogens, the modulation of the immune system and support of the integrity of the gut mucosal barrier. The bacteria are collected in communities that vary in density and composition within each segment of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Therefore, every change in the gut ecosystem has been connected to an increased susceptibility or exacerbation of various GI disorders.

We compared the intestinal fermentative capability of stunted and nonstunted ('healthy') children in southern India using two types of RS: high amylose maize starch (HAMS) and acetylated HAMS (HAMSA). Twenty children (10 stunted and 10 healthy) aged 2 to 5 years were fed biscuits containing HAMS (10 g/day) for two weeks followed by a 2-week washout and then HAMSA biscuits (10 g/day) for 2 weeks. Fecal samples were collected at 3-4 day intervals and pH and SCFA analyzed. At entry, stunted children had lower SCFA concentrations compared to healthy children. Both types of RS led to a significant decrease in fecal pH and increase in fecal acetate and propionate in both healthy and stunted children. However, while HAMS increased fecal butyrate in both groups of children, HAMSA increased butyrate in healthy but not stunted children. Furthermore, healthy children showed a significantly greater increase than stunted children in both acetate and butyrate when fed either RS. No adverse effects were reported with either RS. Stunted children have impaired capacity to ferment certain types of RS which has implications for choice of RS in formulations aimed at improving microbial function in stunted children.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31427714>Biomarkers for oralization during long-term proton pump inhibitor therapy predict survival in cirrhosis.</a></h2><p>Proton pump inhibitors (PPI) are an invaluable therapy option for  related diseases; however, PPI therapy is also linked to a series of side effects in cirrhosis, such as microbiome alterations, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and hepatic encephalopathy.

Mechanisms responsible for the efficacy of n-3 PUFAs include: (1) Reduction of triglyceride levels; (2) anti-arrhythmic and antithrombotic effects, and (3) resolution of inflammatory processes. The human microbiota project and subsequent studies using next-generation sequencing technology have highlighted that thousands of different microbial species are present in the human gut, and that there has been a significant variability of taxa in the microbiota composition among people. Several factors (gestational age, mode of delivery, diet, sanitation and antibiotic treatment) influence the bacterial community in the human gastrointestinal tract, and among these diet habits play a crucial role. The disturbances in the gut microbiota composition, i.e., gut , have been associated with diseases ranging from localized gastrointestinal disorders to neurologic, respiratory, metabolic, ocular, and cardiovascular illnesses. Many studies have been published about the effects of probiotics and prebiotics on the gut microbiota/microbioma. On the contrary, PUFAs in the gut microbiota have been less well defined.

The role of the breast microbiome in breast cancer is unresolved, nevertheless it seems that the gut microbiome does have a role in the pathology of the disease. The gut microbiome secretes bioactive metabolites (reactivated estrogens, short chain fatty , amino  metabolites, or secondary bile ) that modulate breast cancer. We highlight the bacterial species or taxonomical units that generate these metabolites, we show their mode of action, and discuss how the metabolites affect mitochondrial metabolism and other molecular events in breast cancer. These metabolites resemble human hormones, as they are produced in a "gland" (in this case, the microbiome) and they are subsequently transferred to distant sites of action through the circulation. These metabolites appear to be important constituents of the tumor microenvironment.

The aim of this review is to summarize the data related to the influence of the gut microbiota on the development of obesity and the MetS, highlighting the role of diet in controlling the MetS by modifying the gut microbiota. The main alterations in the gut microbiota of individuals with MetS consist of an increased Firmicutes/Bacteriodetes ratio and a reduced capacity to degrade carbohydrates to short-chain fatty , which in turn is related with the metabolic dysfunction of the host organism rather than with obesity itself.

We hypothesized that intestinal microbiota changes may mediate these effects, and this study aims to prove this hypothesis. Mice were fed a normal diet (ND, 0.86% methionine + 4% fat), a HF diet (HFD, 0.86% methionine + 20% fat), or a MRD (0.17% methionine + 20% fat) and euthanized at week 22. Our results showed that the HFD induced fat accumulation and gut microbiota ; reduced short-chain fatty  (SCFA) production; and increased intestinal permeability, inflammatory response, and oxidative stress. The MRD decreased the body weight, body fat rate, and blood glucose and plasma lipid levels; increased the abundance of putative SCFA-producing bacteria Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, Bacteroides, Roseburia, Coprococcus, and Ruminococcus and inflammation-inhibiting bacteria Oscillospira and Corynebacterium; and decreased the abundance of inflammation-producing bacteria Desulfovibrio in colonic contents. Moreover, the MRD improved intestinal barrier function, inflammatory response, and oxidative stress, and altered the metabolite levels of colonic contents (such as increasing SCFA and bile  concentrations); the latter may have contributed to the prevention of HFD-induced obesity. In conclusion, the MRD can improve gut health by regulating the intestinal microbiota and its metabolite profiles in the HFD mice.

However, OCA causes major side effects including pruritus, while increases the risk for liver decompensation in cirrhotic patients. Ursodeoxycholic  (UDCA), is a safe and unexpensive bile  used in the treatment of liver disorders whose mechanism of action is poorly defined. Here we have compared the effects of OCA and UDCA in a mouse model of NASH. In mice exposed to a diet rich in fat/cholesterol and fructose (HFD-F), treatment with OCA or UDCA effectively prevented body weight gain, insulin resistance, as demonstrated by OGTT, and AST plasma levels. After 12 weeks HFD-F mice developed liver microvesicular steatosis, inflammation and mild fibrosis, increased expression of inflammatory (TNFα, IL6, F4/80) and fibrosis (αSma, Col1α1, Tgfβ) markers, reduced liver expression of FXR, dysregulated liver FXR signaling and elevated levels of Tauro-α and β-muricholic  (T-α and βMCA), two FXR antagonists in mice. Both compounds prevented these changes and improved liver histopathology. OCA reduced primary bile  synthesis worsening the T-CA/T-βMCA ratio. UDCA effectively transactivated GPBAR1 in vitro. By RNAseq analysis we found that among over 2400 genes modulated by the HFD-F, only 32 and 60 genes were modulated by OCA and UDCA, with only 3 genes (Dbp, Adh7, Osgin1) being modulated by both agents.

In pigs, the weaning transition represents a drastic changes event leading to high risk of gut , which in most cases results in economic losses for swine industry. The blood type antigens expressed on mucosal surfaces can act as receptors for bacterial adhesion and the hypothesis of possible associations between blood groups and intestinal microbial profiles has been tested in human with contrasting results. Nevertheless, no studies testing the blood type as possible shaping factor for gut microbiota are available for pigs. The results of our previous study suggested the porcine AO blood types system as a possible factor influencing the microbiota composition. In the present study, the changes in fecal microbiota of 12 piglets were followed from 7 days after birth to 2 weeks post-weaning, testing the hypothesis that blood types may impact on its structure. No effects attributable to the difference in blood groups were detected, however, the sampling site (faeces) and the low statistical power might have masked the hypothesized impact. The data clearly showed the rearrangement of the bacterial ecosystem triggered by weaning transition; mainly consisting of a shift from a Bacteroidaceae-Enterobacteriaceae dominated community, to a Prevotellaceae-Ruminococcaceae dominated community. The functional analysis by metagenomic predictions suggested a role of the high levels of long-chain fatty  in swine milk as energy source for Enterobacteriaceae (E. coli), in suckling piglets.

The aim: the determination of prevalence and features of SIBO in a series of patients with hyperlipidemia and in control subjects.Materials and methods: Nineteen patients with hyperlipidemia and ten control subjects were studied. Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth was assessed by a lactulose breath test. Such biochemical markers as CRP, ALT, AST, GGTP, apolipoprotein B, bilirubin, cholesterol and lipid profile were determined. Except the routine interpretation of lactulose breath test, which contains the SIBO detection, small intestinal transit time and hydrogen level evaluation with next comparison between groups of patients was realized.Results: Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth was present in 78.9% of patients with hyperlipidemia and 40% in control subjects. The maximal dose of H2 was particularly higher in patients with hyperlipidemia in comparison with control group (94,7±13,69 vs. 36,13±5,4). There was a strong correlation between AST level and SIBO existence in both groups (r=1). Positive connection between LDL, TG, VLDL and the dose of exhaled hydrogen on 120 minute (r=0.6, r= 0.62, r=0.7 respectively) and strong negative correlation between HDL and 120 minute dose (r=-0.74) in main group was marked.Conclusions: Patients with hyperlipidemia have a higher prevalence of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth and there is a relationship between H2 rate and LDL, TG, VLDL.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30929665>Pharmacologic and Nonpharmacologic Therapies for the Gut Microbiota in Type 2 Diabetes.</a></h2><p>The gut microbiota is an important regulator of host metabolism. Metagenome analyses have demonstrated that the gut microbiota differs between patients with type 2 diabetes and healthy subjects, and several studies have shown that impaired glucose metabolism is associated with decreased levels of butyrate-producing bacteria. Gut microbiota-produced metabolites, such as short-chain fatty , amino  derivatives and secondary bile , participate in metabolic and immunologic processes and, hence, pose putative links between the gut microbiota and glucose homeostasis. Strategies to prevent and treat type 2 diabetes through manipulation of the gut microbiota are being developed. These include replacement of the gut microbiota by fecal transplantation, consumption of fibres to promote the function and growth of beneficial bacteria and treatment with probiotic bacterial strains. Furthermore, it has been shown that many drugs, including drugs used for treatment of diabetes, have major impacts on gut microbiota and, thereby, potentially on glucose metabolism. In particular, the commonly used drug metformin has been shown to influence the functional capacity of the gut microbiota, and recent evidence indicates that this may contribute to the antidiabetes effect of metformin.Copyright © 2019 Canadian Diabetes Association.

Previously, our study revealed significant loss of Roseburia intestinalis from the gut of untreated patients with CD, and that R. intestinalis exerted anti‑inflammatory functions in TNBS‑induced colitis; however, the function of R. intestinalis supernatant is unknown. Therefore, LPS‑induced macrophages, including RAW264.7 macrophages and bone marrow‑derived macrophages were treated with R. intestinalis supernatant. The results indicated that R. intestinalis supernatant suppressed expression of interleukin (IL)‑6 and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) by macrophages. Additionally, these findings were further verified in vivo in DSS‑ and TNBS‑induced mouse models of colitis. It was observed that R. intestinalis supernatant ameliorated IBD colitis by reducing the number of inflammatory macrophages and Th17 cells in the colon, and by downregulating the expression of IL‑6 and STAT3. Finally, the non‑protein components of R. intestinalis supernatant were examined using gas chromatography‑mass spectrometry analysis and identified the presence of short‑chain fatty . In conclusion, the results of the present study indicated that R. intestinalis supernatant may regulate immune responses and ameliorate colitis.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31533200>ω-3 PUFAs Alleviate High-Fat Diet-Induced Circadian Intestinal Microbes .</a></h2><p>Published data support that fish oil and algae oil rich in ω-3 polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFAs) protect against hyperlipidemia in mice. This study is aimed to explore the effects of fish oil and algae oil on high-fat diet (HFD) induced circadian intestinal microbes dysregulation.Male C57BL/6 mice are randomly divided into four groups, which are fed a normal chow diet (CON), a HFD, a HFD supplemented with fish oil (FO), and a HFD supplemented with algae oil (AO), respectively, for 12 weeks. At the end of the experiment, mice are sacrificed at 12 h intervals with the first one at zeitgeber time 0 (ZT0) and the second at zeitgeber time 12 (ZT12). FO and AO groups ameliorate diet-induced hyperlipidemia. The relative abundance of certain genera is improved in FO and AO groups according to 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The short-chain fatty  (SCFAs) producing bacteria Butyricimonas and some of the genera in the Lachnospiraceae recover to the normal circadian rhythm in both FO and AO groups.The data show that FO and AO alleviate circadian gut microbiota dysregulation in mice caused by HFD, and support the further investigation of ω-3 PUFAs as a dietary intervention strategy for the prevention of hyperlipidemia.© 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

This review focuses on specific alterations of gut microbiota mostly observed in autistic patients. Particularly, the mechanisms through which such alterations may trigger the production of the bacterial metabolites, or leaky gut in autistic people are described. Various altered metabolite levels were observed in the blood and urine of autistic children, many of which were of bacterial origin such as short chain fatty  (SCFAs), indoles and lipopolysaccharides (LPS). A less integrative gut-blood-barrier is abundant in autistic individuals. This explains the leakage of bacterial metabolites into the patients, triggering new body responses or an altered metabolism. Some other co-occurring symptoms such as mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress in cells, altered tight junctions in the blood-brain barrier and structural changes in the cortex, hippocampus, amygdala and cerebellum were also detected. Moreover, this paper suggests that ASD is associated with an unbalanced gut microbiota (). Although the cause-effect relationship between ASD and gut microbiota is not yet well established, the consumption of specific probiotics may represent a side-effect free tool to re-establish gut homeostasis and promote gut health.

Accumulating evidence has proven that gut  is significantly associated with the development and progression of NAFLD, and several highly variable species in gut microbiota have been identified. The gut microbiota contributes to NAFLD by abnormal regulation of the liver-gut axis, gut microbial components and microbial metabolites, and affects the secretion of bile . Due to the key role of the gut microbiota in NAFLD, it has been regarded as a potential target for the pharmacological and clinical treatment of NAFLD. The present review provides a systematic summary of the characterization of gut microbiota and the significant association between the gut microbiota and NAFLD.

Applying 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis and metatranscriptomic analyses, we characterized the longitudinal changes in the profiles and the function of the oral microbiome in a 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide (4-NQO)-induced model of OSCC in gnotobiotic mice. We characterized the dynamics of the oral microbiome in this model using two different microbiome inocula: one from healthy mice and the other from mice bearing a 4-NQO-induced tumor. Mice colonized with different oral microbiomes and exposed to 4-NQO had increased tumor numbers and sizes compared to controls exposed to 4-NQO but lacking a microbiome. We observed an overall increase in diversity in the tumorigenic samples compared to that in the nontumor group not exposed to 4-NQO. Despite the variability in community dynamics, specific patterns emerged during the progression of the disease. In the two groups that were inoculated with the OSCC-associated microbiome, we observed opposite profiles of abundance in  and  While the percentage of  bacteria decreased in the control group, it increased in the OSCC group, and the opposite was observed for  The metatranscriptomic analysis revealed overexpression of the same metabolic signatures associated with OSCC regardless of the community profile. These included nitrogen transport, response to stress, interspecies interactions, Wnt pathway modulation, and amino  and lipid biosynthesis. Thus, these results seem to suggest that certain collective physiological activities are critical for microbiome-mediated OSCC progression. There is growing evidence that changes in the microbiome are associated with carcinogenesis. To date, no consistent oral microbiome composition associated with OSCC has been identified. Longitudinal and functional studies like the study presented here should yield a better understanding of the role that the oral microbiome plays in OSCC. Our findings, obtained using a germ-free mouse model, indicate that the presence of different oral microbiomes enhances tumorigenesis and increases the final number of tumors in mice. By studying community-wide expression profiles, we found that regardless of the phylogenetic composition of the microbiome, the same metabolic activities were consistently associated with OSCC. Therefore, due to the functional redundancy of the microbiome, the critical element in explaining the contribution of the microbiota in OSCC is the collective physiological activity of the community, thus accounting for the previous inability to identify a consensus community profile or etiologic agents for OSCC.Copyright © 2019 Stashenko et al.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31522290>The differences of bacterial communities in the tissues between healthy and diseased Yesso scallop (Patinopecten yessoensis).</a></h2><p>The tissues of marine invertebrates are colonized by species-rich microbial communities. The  of host's microbiota is tightly associated with the invertebrate diseases. Yesso scallop (Patinopecten yessoensis), one of the most important maricultured scallops in northern China, has recently suffered massive summer mortalities, which causes huge production losses. The knowledge about the interactions between the Yesso scallop and its microbiota is important to develop the strategy for the disease prevention and control. In the present study, the bacterial communities in hemolymph, intestine, mantle and adductor muscle were compared between the healthy and diseased Yesso scallop based on the high-throughput sequencing of 16S rRNA gene. The results indicated obvious difference of the composition rather than the diversity of the bacterial communities between the healthy and diseased Yesso scallop. Vibrio, Francisella and Photobacterium were found to overgrow and dominate in the mantle, adductor muscle and intestine of the diseased scallops, respectively. The prediction of bacterial community metagenomes and the variations of KEGG pathways revealed that the proportions of the pathways related with neurodegenerative diseases and carbohydrate metabolism both increased significantly in the mantle and hemolymph of the diseased scallops. The abundance of the metabolism pathways including carbohydrate metabolism, lipid metabolism and amino  metabolism decreased significantly in the intestine of diseased scallops.

We hypothesized whether the mixture of mulberry water extracts and silk amino  can alleviate nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) induced by high fat diets. Male Sprague Dawley rats were orally provided with high fat diets containing different ratios of MB and SA (1:3, MS1:3, or 1:5, MS1:5) or cellulose (the disease-control) for 12 weeks. Rats had 200 or 600 mg/kg bw of MS1:3 and MS1:5 (MS1:3-L, MS1:3-H; MS1:5-L, and MS1:5-H). Rats in the normal-control group were fed the 20% fat diet with cellulose. Disease-control rats exhibited much greater triglyceride (TG) deposition in the liver than the normal-control rats along with increased body weight gain, visceral fat mass, serum concentrations of cholesterol, triglyceride and nonesterified fatty  (NEFA), and insulin resistance. Disease-control rats also had liver damage with increased oxidative stress and inflammation compared to the normal-control rats. MS1:3-H and MS1:5-H were found to have greater hepatic glycogen accumulation and decreased hepatic TG, insulin resistance, and dyslipidemia, with MS1:5-H being similar to the normal-control. MS1:3-H alleviated oxidative stress with lower hepatic lipid peroxide compared to MS1:5-H whereas MS1:5-H ameliorated inflammation and hepatocyte damage better than MS1:3-H. Both MS1:3-H and MS1:5-H potentiated hepatic insulin signaling (pAktpACC) and reduced the mRNA expression of TG synthesis genes mRNA (FAS and SREBP-1c). In the gut microbiome MS1:3-H elevated the ratio of  to  in the cecum better than MS1:5-H but MS1:5-H reduced the proinflammatory .

Inflammation has been implicated as a significant driver for the development of tolerance to opioids. Recent studies show that chronic morphine in mice results in gut microbial  and inflammation in the colon. In the present study, we examined whether colonic inflammation results in tolerance to the antinociceptive effects of morphine. Colonic inflammation was induced in mice by intrarectal administration of 2,4,6-trinitro-benzene sulfonic . The development of antinociceptive tolerance was determined by warm-water tail-immersion assay in mice implanted with 25-, 50-, or 75-mg morphine pellet. Colonic inflammation significantly enhanced the rate at which tolerance developed in each cohort of chronic morphine-treated mice. At the lowest dose of morphine pellet (25 mg), antinociceptive tolerance only developed in the presence of colonic inflammation, whereas in 50- and 75-mg pelleted mice, tolerance developed faster in the inflamed animals than in the noninflamed mice. The enhanced antinociceptive tolerance was attenuated with daily administration of peripheral opioid receptor antagonist, 6--heterocyclic-substituted naltrexamine derivative [17-cyclopropylmethyl-3,14-dihydroxy-4,5-epoxy-6-[(4'pyridyl)acetamido]morphinan (NAP)], irrespective of colonic inflammation. Collectively, these findings show that the rate of tolerance to morphine antinociception is exaggerated in the presence of colonic inflammation, and tolerance is prevented by a peripheral -opioid receptor antagonist. These studies suggest a peripheral component to the development of antinociceptive tolerance to opioids. Furthermore, peripherally selective opioid antagonists may be useful adjuncts in opioid-based pain management. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: This study supports the notion that inflammation influences the development of antinociceptive tolerance to chronic morphine exposure. We found that, in the presence of colonic inflammation, the rate of development of tolerance to the antinociceptive effects of morphine increased. We also found that treatment with a peripheral opioid receptor antagonist prevented morphine antinociceptive tolerance. Increasing opioid intake during an inflammatory state would result in decreased analgesia and enhanced analgesic tolerance, which puts patients with inflammatory bowel diseases, inflammatory joint diseases, and sickle cell anemia at risk for heavy opioid use.Copyright © 2019 by The American Society for Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31220352>Neuroinflammation in Murine Cirrhosis Is Dependent on the Gut Microbiome and Is Attenuated by Fecal Transplant.</a></h2><p>Cirrhosis and hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is associated with an altered gut-liver-brain axis. Fecal microbial transplant (FMT) after antibiotics improves outcomes in HE, but the impact on brain function is unclear. The aim of this study is to determine the effect of colonization using human donors in germ-free (GF) mice on the gut-liver-brain axis. GF and conventional mice were made cirrhotic using carbon tetrachloride and compared with controls in GF and conventional state. Additional GF mice were colonized with stool from controls (Ctrl-Hum) and patients with cirrhosis (Cirr-Hum). Stools from patients with HE cirrhosis after antibiotics were pooled (pre-FMT). Stools from the same patients 15 days after FMT from a healthy donor were also pooled (post-FMT). Sterile supernatants were created from pre-FMT and post-FMT samples. GF mice were colonized using stools/sterile supernatants. For all mice, frontal cortex, liver, and small/large intestines were collected. Cortical inflammation, synaptic plasticity and gamma-aminobutyric  (GABA) signaling, and liver inflammation and intestinal 16s ribosomal RNA microbiota sequencing were performed. Conventional cirrhotic mice had higher degrees of neuroinflammation, microglial/glial activation, GABA signaling, and intestinal  compared with other groups. Cirr-Hum mice had greater neuroinflammation, microglial/glial activation, and GABA signaling and lower synaptic plasticity compared with Ctrl-Hum mice. This was associated with greater  but no change in liver histology. Pre-FMT material colonization was associated with neuroinflammation and microglial activation and , which was reduced significantly with post-FMT samples. Sterile pre-FMT and post-FMT supernatants did not affect brain parameters. Liver inflammation was unaffected. Conclusion: Fecal microbial colonization from patients with cirrhosis results in higher degrees of neuroinflammation and activation of GABAergic and neuronal activation in mice regardless of cirrhosis compared with those from healthy humans. Reduction in neuroinflammation by using samples from post-FMT patients to colonize GF mice shows a direct effect of fecal microbiota independent of active liver inflammation or injury.© 2019 by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31411471>Alterations of the Brain Proteome and Gut Microbiota in d-Galactose-Induced Brain-Aging Mice with Krill Oil Supplementation.</a></h2><p>Brain aging is commonly associated with neurodegenerative disorders, but the ameliorative effect of krill oil and the underlying mechanism remain unclear.

Krill oil treatment decreased the expression of truncated dopamine- and cAMP-regulated phosphoproteins and proteins involved in the calcium signaling pathway. In addition, the concentrations of dopamine were increased in the serum ( < 0.05) and brain ( > 0.05) due to the enhanced expressions of tyrosine-3-monooxygenase and aromatic l-amino  decarboxylase. Moreover, krill oil alleviated gut microbiota , decreased the abundance of bacteria that consume the precursor tyrosine, and increased the abundance of  spp. and short-chain fatty  producers.

Results showed that oral administration of GFP markedly alleviated dyslipidaemia through decreasing the serum levels of total triglycerides, total cholesterol, and free fatty , and significantly suppressing hepatic lipid accumulation and steatosis. Besides, the excretion of fecal bile  was also promoted by oral administration of GFP. Metagenomic analysis revealed that GFP supplementation (400 mg kg-1 day-1) resulted in significant structure changes on gut microbiota in HFD-fed rats, in particular modulating the relative abundance of functionally relevant microbial phylotypes compared with the HFD group. Key microbial phylotypes responding to GFP intervention were identified to strongly correlate with the lipid metabolism disorder associated parameters using the correlation network based on Spearman's correlation coefficient. Serum and hepatic lipid profiles were found positively correlated with Clostridium-XVIII, Butyricicoccus and Turicibacter, but negatively correlated with Helicobater, Intestinimonas, Barnesiella, Parasutterella, Ruminococcus and Flavonifracter. Moreover, GFP treatment (400 mg kg-1 day-1) regulated the mRNA expression levels of the genes responsible for hepatic lipid and cholesterol metabolism. Oral supplementation of GFP markedly increased the mRNA expression of cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) and bile salt export pump (BSEP), suggesting an enhancement of bile  (BA) synthesis and excretion from the liver. These findings illustrated that GFP could ameliorate lipid metabolic disorders through modulating specific gut microbial phylotypes and regulating hepatic lipid and cholesterol metabolism related genes, and therefore could be used as a potential functional food ingredient for the prevention or treatment of hyperlipidemia.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652902>Impact of Vitamin D Deficit on the Rat Gut Microbiome.</a></h2><p>Inadequate immunologic, metabolic and cardiovascular homeostasis has been related to either an alteration of the gut microbiota or to vitamin D deficiency.

Vaginal microbiota and genital inflammation were analysed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and immunoassays, respectively. We used an integrative bioinformatic pipeline to reveal host and microbe contributions to the metabolome and to comprehensively assess the link between HPV, microbiota, inflammation and cervical disease.Metabolic analysis yielded 475 metabolites with known identities. Unique metabolic fingerprints discriminated patient groups from healthy controls. Three-hydroxybutyrate, eicosenoate, and oleate/vaccenate discriminated (with excellent capacity) between cancer patients versus the healthy participants. Sphingolipids, plasmalogens, and linoleate positively correlated with genital inflammation. Non-Lactobacillus dominant communities, particularly in high-grade dysplasia, perturbed amino  and nucleotide metabolisms. Adenosine and cytosine correlated positively with Lactobacillus abundance and negatively with genital inflammation. Glycochenodeoxycholate and carnitine metabolisms connected non-Lactobacillus dominance to genital inflammation.Cervicovaginal metabolic profiles were driven by cancer followed by genital inflammation, HPV infection, and vaginal microbiota. This study provides evidence for metabolite-driven complex host-microbe interactions as hallmarks of cervical cancer with future translational potential.

While research has revealed a strong genetic component, there are few studies exploring the extent to which lifestyle factors influence psoriasis pathogenesis. The aim of this review was to describe the role of lifestyle factors as both a potential cause and treatment for psoriasis. The review also examines the underlying mechanisms through which these lifestyle factors may operate.This narrative review aims to incorporate current knowledge relating to both lifestyle and pathogenetic factors that contribute to and alleviate psoriasis presentation. Studies reporting the effect of an inflammatory diet and potential dietary benefits are reported, as well as insights into the effects of stress, smoking and alcohol, insulin resistance and exercise.Poor nutrition and low Omega 3 fatty  intake, likely combined with fat malabsorption caused by gut  and systemic inflammation, are associated with psoriasis. The data strongly suggest that improvements to disease severity can be made through dietary and lifestyle interventions and increased physical activity. Less conclusive, although worthy of mention, is the beneficial effect of bile  supplementation.Lifestyle interventions are a promising treatment for psoriasis and its associated co-morbidities. However, gaps and inadequacies exist within the literature, e.g. methodology, absence of a unified scoring system, lack of controlled clinical data and lack of studies without simultaneous usage of biologics or alternative therapies. Future directions should focus on high quality cohort studies and clinical trials.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd and European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism.
