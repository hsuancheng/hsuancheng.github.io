NK cells bridge the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system; they are primed for immediate anti-tumour function but can also have prolonged actions alongside the adaptive T cell response. However, the key signals and cellular processes that are required for extended NK cell responses are not fully known. Herein we show that murine NK cell interaction with tumour cells induces the expression of CD25, the high affinity IL2 receptor, rendering these NK cells highly sensitive to the T cell-derived cytokine IL2. In response to IL2, CD25 NK cells show robust increases in metabolic signalling pathways (mTORC1, cMyc), nutrient transporter expression (CD71, CD98), cellular growth and in NK cell effector functions (IFNγ, granzyme B). Specific ligation of an individual activating NK cell receptor, NK1.1, showed similar increases in CD25 expression and IL2-induced responses. NK cell receptor ligation and IL2 collaborate to induce mTORC1/cMyc signalling leading to high rates of  and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and prolonged NK cell survival. Disrupting mTORC1 and cMyc signalling in CD25 tumour interacting NK cells prevents IL2-induced cell growth and function and compromises NK cell viability. This study reveals that tumour cell interactions and T cell-derived IL2 cooperate to promote robust and prolonged NK cell anti-tumour metabolic responses.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31577302>Correction: Adverse effects of fluorescent carbon dots from canned yellow croaker on cellular respiration and .</a></h1><p>Correction for 'Adverse effects of fluorescent carbon dots from canned yellow croaker on cellular respiration and ' by Dongmei Li et al., Food Funct., 2019, 10, 1123-1131.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31580832>Clinical implications of ALDH1A1 and ALDH1A3 mRNA expression in melanoma subtypes.</a></h1><p>Aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) activity is not only a valuable marker for cancer cells with stem-like features, but also plays a vital role in drug resistance and disease progression in many tumors including melanoma. However, the precise role of ALDH activity in patient prognosis remains unclear. In this study, using the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) RNA-sequencing expression data, we analyzed gene expression of ALDH isozymes in melanoma tumors to define the expression patterns and the prognostic and predictive values of these enzymes. We found that ALDH1A1 and ALDH1A3 had both higher and broader expression ranges in melanoma patients, and that ALDH1A3 expression correlated with better overall survival in metastatic melanoma. Further, stratification of the TCGA cohorts by the mutational subtypes of melanoma specifically revealed that expression of ALDH1A3 correlated with better prognosis in metastatic BRAF-mutant melanoma while expression of ALDH1A1 correlated with better prognosis in BRAF wild-type melanoma. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of these cohorts identified upregulation in oxidative phosphorylation, adipogenesis, and fatty acid metabolism signaling in ALDH1A patients, suggesting BRAF/MEK inhibitor resistance in that subset of patients. On the other hand, GSEA of ALDH1A3 cohorts revealed upregulation in , hypoxia and angiogenesis, suggesting BRAF/MEK inhibitor sensitivity in that subset of patients. Gene expression analysis using pre-treatment tumor samples supports high ALDH1A3 expression before BRAF/MEK inhibitor treatment as predictive of better treatment response in BRAF-mutant melanoma patients. Our study provides evidence that high ALDH1A3 mRNA expression is not only a prognostic marker but also a predictive marker for BRAF/MEK inhibitor treatment response in BRAF-mutant metastatic melanoma patients.Published by Elsevier B.V.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31610916>Zinc protects chondrocytes from monosodium iodoacetate-induced damage by enhancing ATP and mitophagy.</a></h1><p>Osteoarthritis (OA) is characterized with articular cartilage degradation, and monosodium iodoacetate (MIA)-treated chondrocyte is the most commonly used model for mimicking OA progression. Zinc protects chondrocytes from MIA-induced damage. Here, we explored the protective effects of 25 μM zinc on 5 μM MIA-treated SW1353 cells (human chondrosarcoma cell line) through the analysis of energy metabolism- and autophagy-related parameters. We found that the exposure of SW1353 cells to MIA decreased ATP levels, expression of -related proteins, including glucose transporter 1, hexokinase 2, and pyruvate dehydrogenase E1 component subunit alpha, and the levels of mitochondrial complex I, II, IV, and V subunits of the oxidative phosphorylation pathway. MIA treatment also decreased the expression of autophagy-related proteins, including autophagic elongation protein 5 (ATG5), ATG7, and microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B light chain 3B (LC3-II) and mitophagy-related proteins, including phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN)-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1), ubiquitin, and p62. These results indicate that MIA interferes with energy metabolism and the autophagic clearance of dysfunctional mitochondria (so called mitophagy). Interestingly, zinc exposure could almost completely reverse the effects of MIA, suggesting its potential protective role against OA progression.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

However, the global coastal pollution status of herbicides and their negative impact on marine life (especially phytoplankton) in natural environmental concentrations are poorly understood except for few special environments (e.g. the Great Barrier Reef, Australia). Our field investigation of the distribution of ten triazine herbicides in the Bohai Sea and the Yellow Sea of China revealed that the concentrations of triazine herbicides exceeded the "No Observed Effect Concentrations" for phytoplankton. Their total concentrations could be as high as 6.61 nmol L. Based on the concentration addition model, the toxicity of herbicide homologues is usually cumulative, and the combined toxicity of these ten triazine herbicides could cause 13.2% inhibition on the chlorophyll a fluorescence intensity of a representative diatom species Phaeodactylum tricornutum Pt-1, which corresponds roughly to the toxicity of atrazine in an equivalent concentration of 14.08 nmol L. Atrazine in this equivalent-effect concentration could greatly inhibit the growth of cells, the maximum quantum efficiency of photosystem II (Fv/Fm), and nutrient absorption of Phaeodactylum tricornutum Pt-1. Transcriptome analysis revealed that multiple metabolic pathways (Calvin cycle, tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, /gluconeogenesis, etc.) related with photosynthesis and carbon metabolism were greatly disturbed, which might ultimately influence the primary productivity of coastal waters. Moreover, with the values of its bioaccumulation factor ranging from 69.6 to 118.9, atrazine was found to be accumulated in algal cells, which indicates that herbicide pollution might eventually affect the marine food web and even threaten the seafood safety of human beings.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

To date, very few available drugs have been successfully used to treat PDAC due to the poor understanding of the tumor-specific features. One of the hallmarks of pancreatic cancer cells is the deregulated cellular energetics characterized by the "Warburg effect". It has been known for decades that cancer cells have a dramatically increased glycolytic flux even in the presence of oxygen and normal mitochondrial function. Glycolytic flux is the central carbon metabolism process in all cells, which not only produces adenosine triphosphate (ATP) but also provides biomass for anabolic processes that support cell proliferation. Expression levels of glucose transporters and rate-limiting enzymes regulate the rate of glycolytic flux. Intermediates that branch out from  are responsible for redox homeostasis, glycosylation, and biosynthesis. Beyond enhanced glycolytic flux, pancreatic cancer cells activate nutrient salvage pathways, which includes autophagy and micropinocytosis, from which the generated sugars, amino acids, and fatty acids are used to buffer the stresses induced by nutrient deprivation. Further, PDAC is characterized by extensive metabolic crosstalk between tumor cells and cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME). In this review, we will give an overview on recent progresses made in understanding glucose metabolism-related deregulations in PDAC.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31624330>Membrane bound IL-21 based NK cell feeder cells drive robust expansion and metabolic activation of NK cells.</a></h1><p>NK cell adoptive therapy is a promising cancer therapeutic approach, but there are significant challenges that limiting its feasibility and clinical efficacy. One difficulty is the paucity of clinical grade manufacturing platforms to support the large scale expansion of highly active NK cells. We created an NK cell feeder cell line termed 'NKF' through overexpressing membrane bound IL-21 that is capable of inducing robust and sustained proliferation (>10,000-fold expansion at 5 weeks) of highly cytotoxic NK cells. The expanded NK cells exhibit increased cytotoxic function against a panel of blood cancer and solid tumor cells as compared to IL-2-activated non-expanded NK cells. The NKF-expanded NK cells also demonstrate efficacy in mouse models of human sarcoma and T cell leukemia. Mechanistic studies revealed that membrane-bound IL-21 leads to an activation of a STAT3/c-Myc pathway and increased NK cell metabolism with a shift towards aerobic . The NKF feeder cell line is a promising new platform that enables the large scale proliferation of highly active NK cells in support of large scale third party NK cell clinical studies that have been recently intiatied. These results also provide mechanistic insights into how membrane-bound IL-21 regulates NK cell expansion.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31628536>Energy metabolism involved in fertility of the wheat TCMS line YS3038.</a></h1><p>In the wheat TCMS line YS3038, the anther development is inhibited from late uninucleate stage to the binucleate stage. The disruption of energy metabolism pathways by aberrant transcriptional regulation causes the male sterility under low temperatures. The utilization of thermosensitive male sterile (TMS) lines provides a basis for two-line breeding. Previous work, including morphological and cytological observations, has shown that the development process of the TMS line YS3038 is inhibited from the late uninucleate stage to the binucleate stage. Transcriptomics studies could now help to elucidate the overall expression of related genes in a specific reproductive process, revealing the metabolic network and its regulatory mechanism of the reproductive process from the transcription level. Considering the fertility characteristics of YS3038, three important stages for transcriptome analysis were determined to be the early uninucleate, late uninucleate and binucleate stages. The number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) was found to be highest in the binucleate stage, and most were related to energy metabolism. Quantitative PCR analysis of selected genes related to energy metabolism revealed that their expression patterns were consistent with the sequencing results. Analysis of the fertility mechanism of YS3038 showed that although the tapetum of anthers was degraded in advance of the tetrad stage, the development of microspores did not result in obvious abnormalities until the binucleate stage, because the genes involved in energy metabolism pathways, including starch and sucrose metabolism (SSM), , the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, and respiration electron transport chain are differentially expressed under sterile and fertile conditions. Therefore, the pollen in YS3038 was sterile.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31580166>Computational metabolism modeling predicts risk of distant relapse-free survival in breast cancer patients.</a></h1><p> Differences in metabolism among breast cancer subtypes suggest that metabolism plays an important role in this disease. Flux balance analysis is used to explore these differences as well as drug response.  Proteomics data from breast tumors were obtained by mass-spectrometry. Flux balance analysis was performed to study metabolic networks. Flux activities from metabolic pathways were calculated and used to build prognostic models.  Flux activities of vitamin A, tetrahydrobiopterin and β-alanine metabolism pathways split our population into low- and high-risk patients. Additionally, flux activities of  and glutamate metabolism split triple negative tumors into low- and high-risk groups.

As an ecological wastewater treatment facility, constructed wetland (CW) is an important sink of NPs. However, little is known about the effects of NPs on microbial nitrogen transformation and related genes in CWs. In this study, short-term (5 days) and long-term (60 days) exposure experiments were conducted to investigate the effect of TiO NPs (0, 1, and 50 mg/L) on microbial nitrogen removal in CWs. The results showed that nitrogen removal efficiency was decreased by 35%-51% after long-term exposure to TiO NPs. Metagenomic analysis further confirmed that TiO NPs declined the relative abundance of functional genes and those enzyme encoding genes involved in the nitrogen metabolism pathway and  metabolism process. Furthermore, our data proved that the indigent  metabolism process resulted in the shortage of electron (NADH) and energy sources (ATP), causing inefficient nitrogen removal. Overall, these results revealed that the accumulation of TiO NPs altered the genetic expression of biofilm in CWs, which had significant impacts on biological nitrogen transformation.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

We hypothesized that such treatment would cause depletion of mitochondrial DNA and provide insight into the consequences of degradation of RPE mitochondrial function in aging and disease. Treatment of differentiated ARPE-19 or human primary RPE cells with 200 µM ddI for 6-24 days was not cytotoxic but caused up to 60% depletion of mitochondrial DNA, and a similar reduction in mitochondrial membrane potential and NDUFA9 protein abundance. Mitochondrial DNA-depleted RPE cells demonstrated enhanced aerobic  by extracellular flux analysis, increased AMP kinase activation, reduced mTOR activity, and increased resistance to cell death in response to treatment with the oxidant, sodium iodate. We conclude that ddI-mediated mitochondrial DNA depletion promotes a glycolytic shift in differentiated RPE cells and enhances resistance to oxidative damage. Our use of ddI treatment to induce progressive depletion of mitochondrial DNA in differentiated human RPE cells should be widely applicable for other studies aimed at understanding RPE mitochondrial dysfunction in aging and disease.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668072>Glechomanamides A-C, Germacrane Sesquiterpenoids with an Unusual Δ-7,12-Lactam Moiety from  and Their Antiangiogenic Activity.</a></h1><p>Three new germacrane sesquiterpenoid-type alkaloids with an unusual Δ-7,12-lactam moiety, glechomanamides A-C (-), and two pairs of 7,12-hemiketal sesquiterpenoid epimers (/, /) were isolated from .

The mechanism of PFKFB3 expression upregulation in cancer cells has not been fully elucidated. The PFKFB3 3'-UTR is reported to contain AU-rich elements (AREs) that are important for regulating PFKFB3 mRNA stability. However, the mechanisms by which PFKFB3 mRNA stability is determined by its 3'-UTR are not well known. We demonstrated that tristetraprolin (TTP), an ARE-binding protein, has a critical function regulating PFKFB3 mRNA stability. Our results showed that PFKFB3 mRNA contains three AREs in the 3'-UTR. TTP bound to the 3rd ARE and enhanced the decay of PFKFB3 mRNA. Overexpression of TTP decreased PFKFB3 expression and ATP levels but increased GSH level in cancer cells. Overexpression of PFKFB3 cDNA without the 3'-UTR rescued ATP level and GSH level in TTP-overexpressing cells. Our results suggested that TTP post-transcriptionally downregulated PFKFB3 expression and that overexpression of TTP may contribute to suppression of  and energy production of cancer cells in part by downregulating PFKFB3 expression.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, inactivation of POR1, encoding VDAC1, produces defective growth in the presence of non-fermentable carbon source. Here, we characterized the whole-genome expression pattern of a VDAC1-null strain (Δpor1) by microarray analysis, discovering that the expression of mitochondrial genes was completely abolished, as consequence of the dramatic reduction of mtDNA. To overcome organelle dysfunction, Δpor1 cells do not activate the rescue signaling retrograde response, as ρ cells, and rather carry out complete metabolic rewiring. The TCA cycle works in a "branched" fashion, shunting intermediates towards mitochondrial pyruvate generation via malic enzyme, and the -derived pyruvate is pushed towards cytosolic utilization by PDH bypass rather than the canonical mitochondrial uptake. Overall, Δpor1 cells enhance phospholipid biosynthesis, accumulate lipid droplets, increase vacuoles and cell size, overproduce and excrete inositol. Such unexpected re-arrangement of whole metabolism suggests a regulatory role of VDAC1 in cell bioenergetics.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31595421>Long non-coding RNA LINC00243 promotes proliferation and  in non-small cell lung cancer cells by positively regulating PDK4 through sponging miR-507.</a></h1><p>Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the main subtype of lung cancer. The overall survival of NSCLC patients is relatively low even after various treatments. Accumulating evidence demonstrated that long non-coding RNA (LncRNA) plays crucial roles in different biological process. However, the role of a novel LncRNA, LINC00243, in NSCLC remains unclear. We aimed to explore the biological role of LINC00243 in NSCLC. The mRNA and protein levels were determined by real-time PCR and western blot, respectively. Cell viability in vitro was detected by Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay and colony-formation assay. Reporter assay was used to detect the interactions between molecules, and the interaction was assessed by RNA pull-down assay. LINC00243 expression increased in human NSCLC tissues and associated with poor prognosis of NSCLC patients. LINC00243 knockdown inhibited proliferation and  of NSCLC cells. Mechanically, LINC00243 acted as a molecular sponge for miR-507, and miR-507 reversed the effect of LINC00243 on promoting proliferation and  of NSCLC cells. Moreover, LINC00243 modulated expression of endogenous miR-507-targeted PDK4. LINC00243 promotes proliferation and  in NSCLC cells by positively regulating PDK4 through sponging miR-507.

However, the precise mechanism of the matrine antihuman chronic myeloid leukemia remains unclear. In this study, we showed that matrine significantly inhibited the cell proliferation and induced apoptosis by regulating Warburg effect through controlling hexokinases 2 (HK2) expression in myeloid leukemia cells. Interestingly, matrine inhibited the expression of HK2 mediated by reduction in c-Myc binding to HK2 gene intron and led to downregulation of HK2, which upregulated proapoptotic protein Bad and then induced apoptosis. We further demonstrated that matrine could synergize with lonidamine, an inhibitor of HK2, for the treatment of myeloid leukemia, both  and . Taken together, our findings reveal that matrine could promote human myeloid leukemia cells apoptosis  regulating Warburg effect by controlling HK2.Copyright © 2019 Lin, Wu, Cai, Li, Su, Wang, Cao and Ma.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31597342>Pharmacological Targeting of GLUT1 to Control Autoreactive T Cell Responses.</a></h1><p>An increasing body of evidence indicates that bio-energetic metabolism of T cells can be manipulated to control T cell responses. This potentially finds a field of application in the control of the T cell responses in autoimmune diseases, including in type 1 diabetes (T1D). Of the possible metabolic targets, Glut1 gained considerable interest because of its pivotal role in glucose uptake to fuel  in activated T cells, and the recent development of a novel class of small molecules that act as selective inhibitor of Glut1. We believe we can foresee a possible application of pharmacological Glut1 blockade approach to control autoreactive T cells that destroy insulin producing beta cells. However, Glut1 is expressed in a broad range of cells in the body and off-target and side effect are possible complications. Moreover, the duration of the treatment and the age of patients are critical aspects that need to be addressed to reduce toxicity.

However, the expression patterns and biological effects of mitochondrial fission and fusion proteins in pancreatic cancer (PC) are still unclear.The expressions of mitochondrial fission and fusion proteins were first evaluated by qRT-PCR and western blot analysis in both PC cell lines and tissue samples. In addition, the biologic functions of the differentially expressed proteins in PC cell growth and metastasis both in vitro and in vivo and their potential underlying mechanisms were systematically explored.We first found that DRP1 was substantially upregulated in PC cell lines and tissue samples mainly due to the downregulation of miR-29a, which contributed to the poor survival of PC patients. DRP1 promoted the growth and metastasis of PC cells both in vitro and in vivo by inducing G1-S cell cycle transition and MMP2 secretion. Mechanistic investigations revealed that increased DRP1 upregulation-mediated mitochondrial fission and subsequently enhanced aerobic  was involved in the promotion of growth and metastasis by DRP1 in PC cells.Our findings demonstrate that mitochondrial fusion protein DRP1 plays a critical oncogenic role in PC cells by enhancing aerobic , which could serve as a novel therapeutic target for PC treatment.This article is protected by copyright.

Recently, a variety of targets depending on the prompted aerobic  process, starting from the abnormal uptake of glucose, and cancer-specific metabolism due to impaired mitochondrial function and abnormal expression of drug-metabolizing enzymes have been investigated and discovered. Given that most solid cancers rely on cancer-specific metabolism to support their growth, it is necessary to examine closely the specific processes of cancer metabolism and have a detailed understanding of how cellular metabolism is altered in colorectal cancer (CRC) related to CRC survival and proliferation. The development of key methods to regulate efficiently cancer-specific metabolism in CRC is still in the initial stage. Therefore, targeting cancer-specific metabolism will yield treatable methods that are critical as a new area of development strategies for CRC treatment.©The Author(s) 2019.

Therefore, we sought to investigate the mitochondria-targeted methylglyoxal scavenger, MitoGamide, in an experimental model of spontaneous diabetic cardiomyopathy.Male 6-week-old Akita or wild type mice received daily oral gavage of MitoGamide or vehicle for 10 weeks. Several morphological and systemic parameters were assessed, as well as cardiac function by echocardiography.Akita mice were smaller in size than wild type counterparts in terms of body weight and tibial length.

None of the aforementioned parameters was impacted by MitoGamide treatment. Echocardiographic analysis confirmed that cardiac dimensions were smaller in Akita hearts. Diastolic dysfunction was evident in Akita mice, and notably, MitoGamide treatment preferentially improved several of these markers, including e'/a' ratio and E/e' ratio.Our findings suggest that MitoGamide, a novel mitochondria-targeted approach, offers cardioprotection in experimental diabetes and therefore may offer therapeutic potential for the treatment of cardiomyopathy in patients with diabetes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31642061>Cancer-associated mutations in human pyruvate kinase M2 impair enzyme activity.</a></h1><p>Mammalian pyruvate kinase catalyzes the final step of , and its M2 isoform (PKM2) is widely expressed in proliferative tissues. Mutations in PKM2 are found in some human cancers, however, the effects of these on enzyme activity and regulation are unknown. Here, we characterized five cancer-associated PKM2 mutations, occurring at various locations on the enzyme, with respect to substrate kinetics and activation by the allosteric activator fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (FBP). The mutants exhibit reduced maximal velocity, reduced substrate affinity, and/or altered activation by FBP. The kinetic parameters of five additional PKM2 mutants that have been used to study enzyme function or regulation also demonstrate the deleterious effects of mutations on PKM2 function. Our findings indicate that PKM2 is sensitive to many amino acid changes and support the hypothesis that decreased PKM2 activity is selected for in rapidly proliferating cells.© 2019 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31645732>Metabolic regulation of gene expression by histone lactylation.</a></h1><p>The Warburg effect, which originally described increased production of lactate in cancer, is associated with diverse cellular processes such as angiogenesis, hypoxia, polarization of macrophages and activation of T cells. This phenomenon is intimately linked to several diseases including neoplasia, sepsis and autoimmune diseases. Lactate, which is converted from pyruvate in tumour cells, is widely known as an energy source and metabolic by-product. However, its non-metabolic functions in physiology and disease remain unknown. Here we show that lactate-derived lactylation of histone lysine residues serves as an epigenetic modification that directly stimulates gene transcription from chromatin. We identify 28 lactylation sites on core histones in human and mouse cells. Hypoxia and bacterial challenges induce the production of lactate by , and this acts as a precursor that stimulates histone lactylation. Using M1 macrophages that have been exposed to bacteria as a model system, we show that histone lactylation has different temporal dynamics from acetylation. In the late phase of M1 macrophage polarization, increased histone lactylation induces homeostatic genes that are involved in wound healing, including Arg1. Collectively, our results suggest that an endogenous 'lactate clock' in bacterially challenged M1 macrophages turns on gene expression to promote homeostasis. Histone lactylation thus represents an opportunity to improve our understanding of the functions of lactate and its role in diverse pathophysiological conditions, including infection and cancer.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31575649>A concerted metabolic shift in early forebrain alters the CSF proteome and depends on MYC downregulation for mitochondrial maturation.</a></h1><p>Massive, coordinated cellular changes accompany the transition of central nervous system (CNS) progenitors from forebrain neurectodermal cells to specified neuroepithelial cells. We have previously found that MYC regulates the changing ribosomal and proteostatic landscapes in mouse forebrain precursors at embryonic days E8.5 and E10.5 (before and after neural tube closure; NTC) (Chau et al., 2018). Here, we demonstrate parallel coordinated transcriptional changes in metabolic machinery during this same stage of forebrain specification. Progenitors showed striking mitochondrial structural changes transitioning from glycolytic cristae at E8.5, to more traditional mitochondria at E10.5. Accordingly, glucose use shifted in progenitors such that E8.5 progenitors relied on , and after NTC increasingly used oxidative phosphorylation. This metabolic shift was matched by changes in surrounding amniotic and cerebrospinal fluid proteomes. Importantly, these mitochondrial morphological shifts depend on MYC downregulation. Together, our findings demonstrate that metabolic shifting accompanies dynamic organelle and proteostatic remodeling of progenitor cells during the earliest stages of forebrain development.© 2019.

Recent studies manifested lncRNA LINC00857 was involved in cell cycle regulation of lung cancer. Due to complicated networks in tumorigenesis, the potential roles of LINC00857 underlying lung cancer progression still need further investigation. In this study, we explored the expression of LINC00857 in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) tissues and LUAD cell lines and found a dramatical upregulation of LINC00857 compared with the adjacent normal lung tissues and BEAS-2B cell line, respectively. Then, LINC00857 knockdown led to the cell proliferation and  was repressed, while the apoptosis was elevated in LUAD cell lines. Furthermore, we identified a direct interaction between LINC00857 and miR-1179 in LUAD cells using bioinformatic method and report assay.

In addition, the increased aromatic compounds (4-hydroxycinnamic acid and benzoic acid) and their precursors (phenylalanine, tyrosine) suggested the activation of shikimate-phenylpropanoid biosynthesis in yellowed rice, which is an antioxidant defense related pathway. In particular, the pathways involved in the metabolism of glutamate and arginine also significantly altered in yellowed rice. Therefore, the enriched pathways of increased amino acids, sugars, sugar alcohols, and intermediates of the TCA cycle during yellowing process are proposed to be associated with the response of heat and dry induced by the yellowing process.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The rats in the normal control group were given sterilized water for free drinking. The rats in the DEN administration group were given 0.1 mg/mL DEN solution for free drinking. After 18 weeks, the kidney tissues were collected and tested for nuclear magnetic resonance detection and pathological examination.  Results: The content of kidneys metabolites in the rats with the DEN administration was changed significantly. The levels of alanine, taurine, pyruvate, acetate, and choline were significantly reduced compared with rat in the normal control group, while the levels of creatine, glycine, TMAO, methionine, proline, lactate, valine, leucine and isoleucine were significantly increased.  Conclusion: Metabolicomics studies have revealed significant differences in five metabolic pathways, including valine, leucine and isoleucine biosynthesis, glycine serine and threonine metabolism, pyruvate metabolism,  or gluconeogenesis, cysteine and methionine metabolism.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31568988>Systematic screening of protein-coding gene expression identified HMMR as a potential independent indicator of unfavorable survival in patients with papillary muscle-invasive bladder cancer.</a></h1><p>Papillary and non-papillary are two histological patterns of bladder carcinogenesis and are considered as dual-track oncogenic pathways, which have different genetic alterations. The TCGA-bladder cancer (BLCA) database contains clinicopathological, genomic and survival data from over 400 muscle-invasive bladder cancer patients. In this study, using data from this database, we performed a systematic screening of gene expression to identify the protein-coding gene that might have prognostic value in papillary and non-papillary muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC). The data of patients with primary MIBC in TCGA-BLCA was acquired from the UCSC Xena project (http://xena.ucsc.edu) for re-analysis. By setting |log2 fold change|≥2 and adjusted p value <0.01 as the screening criteria, we found 751 significantly dysregulated genes, including 183 overexpressed and 568 downregulated genes. HMMR was identified as a potential prognostic marker with unique expression. Multivariate analysis showed that its expression was an independent prognostic indicator of shorter progression-free survival (PFS) (HR: 1.400, 95%CI: 1.021-1.920, p = 0.037) in the papillary subtype. ENST00000393915.8 and ENST00000358715.3, two transcripts that contain all 18 exons and encode the full length of HMMR, were significantly upregulated in cancer tissues compared with normal bladder tissues. None of the 17 CpG sites in its DNA locus was relevant to HMMR expression. 26/403 (6.5%) MIBC cases had HMMR gene-level amplification, which was associated with upregulated HMMR expression compared with the copy-neutral and deletion groups. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) in papillary MIBC found that the high HMMR expression group was associated with upregulated genes enriched in multiple gene sets with well-established role in BC development, including G2M checkpoint, E2 F Targets, Myc Targets V1, Myc Targets V2 and . Based on these findings, we infer that HMMR expression might be a specific prognostic marker in terms of PFS in papillary MIBC. DNA amplification might be an important mechanism of its elevation.Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Masson SAS..

Here, we find a newly synthesized flavonoid named GL-V9, which inhibits  and induces apoptosis of human breast cancer cell lines, and investigate the underlying mechanism. Results show that hexokinase II (HKII) plays important roles in the anticancer effects of GL-V9. GL-V9 not only downregulates the expression of HKII in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells, but also induces dissociation of HKII from voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) in mitochondria, resulting in glycolytic inhibition and mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis. The dissociation of mitochondrial HKII is attributed to GSK-3β-induced phosphorylation of mitochondrial VDAC. Our in vivo experiments also show that GL-V9 significantly inhibits the growth of human breast cancer due to activation of GSK-3β and inactivation of AKT. Thus, GL-V9 induces cytotoxicity in breast cancer cells via disrupting the mitochondrial binding of HKII. Our works demonstrate the significance of metabolic regulators in cancer growth and offer a fresh insight into the molecular basis for the development of GL-V9 as a candidate for breast carcinoma treatment.Copyright © 2019.

However, microbial production of some compounds like aromatic amino acid (AAA)-derived chemicals, remains an outstanding metabolic engineering challenge. Here we present the construction of a Saccharomyces cerevisiae platform strain able to produce high levels of p-coumaric acid, an AAA-derived precursor for many commercially valuable chemicals. This is achieved through engineering the AAA biosynthesis pathway, introducing a phosphoketalose-based pathway to divert glycolytic flux towards erythrose 4-phosphate formation, and optimizing carbon distribution between  and the AAA biosynthesis pathway by replacing the promoters of several important genes at key nodes between these two pathways.

In this study, a full-scale pilot testing was performed with side-by-side operation of a conventional anaerobic-anoxic-aerobic (A2O) process versus a S2EBPR process. A comparison of the performance, activity and microbial community between the two configurations was performed. The results demonstrated that, with the same influent wastewater characteristics, S2EBPR configuration showed improved P removal performance and stability than the conventional A2O configuration, especially when the mixers in the side-stream anaerobic reactor were operated intermittently. Mass balance analysis illustrated that both denitrification and EBPR were enhanced in S2EBPR configuration, where return activated sludge was diverted into the anaerobic zone to promote fermentation and enrichment of polyphosphate accumulating organisms (PAOs), and the influent was bypassed to the anoxic zone for enhancing denitrification. A relatively higher PAO activity and total PAO abundance were observed in S2EBPR than in A2O configuration, accompanied by a higher degree of dependence on  pathway than tricarboxylic acid cycle. No significant difference in the relative abundances of putative PAOs, including Ca. Accumulibacter and Tetrasphaera, were observed between the two configurations. However, higher microbial community diversity indices were observed in S2EBPR configuration than in conventional one. In addition, consistently lower relative abundance of known glycogen accumulating organisms (GAOs) was observed in S2EBPR system. Extended anaerobic retention time and conditions that generate continuous and more complex volatile fatty acids in the side-stream anaerobic reactor of S2EBPR process likely give more competitive advantage for PAOs over GAOs. PAOs exhibited sustained EBPR activity and delayed decay under extended anaerobic condition, likely due to their versatile metabolic pathways depending on the availability and utilization of multiple intracellular polymers. This study provided new insights into the effects of implementing side-stream EBPR configuration on microbial populations, EBPR activity profiles and resulted system performance.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

However, specific mechanisms through which glycogen sustains essential functions remain to be established by rigorous, quantitative studies. Cerebral cortical glycogen concentrations are in the range of 10-12 μmol/g in carefully-handled animals, and the calculated rate of glycogenolysis (CMR) during sensory stimulation is approximately 60% that of glucose utilization (CMR) by all cells, with lower rates during acute hypoglycemia and exercise to exhaustion. CMR is at least fourfold higher when the volume fraction of astrocytes is taken into account. Inclusion of glycogen consumed during sensory stimulation in calculation of the oxygen-glucose index (OGI = CMR/CMR, which has a theoretical maximum of 6 when no other substrates are metabolized) reduces OGI from 5.0 to 2.8. Thus, at least 53% of the carbohydrate is not oxidized, suggesting that glycogen mobilization supports astrocytic , not neuronal oxidation of glycogen-derived lactate that would cause OGI to exceed 6. Failure of glycogenolysis to dilute the specific activity of lactate formed from blood-borne [6-C]glucose indicates compartmentation of glycolytic metabolism of glucose and glycogen and the rapid release from cerebral cortex of glycogen-derived lactate. Together, these findings invalidate the conclusion by others that glycogen-derived lactate is a major fuel for neurons during neurotransmission, memory consolidation, and exercise to exhaustion. Alternative mechanisms, including glucose sparing for neurons, are presented as testable explanations for data interpreted as lactate shuttling.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31613799>Targeting tumor-intrinsic hexosamine biosynthesis sensitizes pancreatic cancer to anti-PD1 therapy.</a></h1><p>Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is considered to be a highly immunosuppressive and heterogenous neoplasm. Despite improved knowledge regarding the genetic background of the tumor and better understanding of the tumor microenvironment, immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy (targeting CTLA4, PD1, PDL1) has not been very successful against PDAC. The robust desmoplastic stroma, along with an extensive extracellular matrix (ECM) that is rich in hyaluronan, plays an integral role in this immune evasion. Hexosamine biosynthesis pathway (HBP), a shunt pathway of , is a metabolic node in cancer cells that can promote survival pathways on one hand and influence the hyaluronan synthesis in the ECM on the other. The rate-limiting enzyme of the pathway, glutamine-fructose amidotransferase (GFAT1), uses glutamine and fructose 6-phosphate to eventually synthesize UDP-GlcNAc. In the current manuscript, we targeted this glutamine-utilizing enzyme by a small molecule glutamine analog (6-diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine or DON). Our results showed that DON decreased the self-renewal potential and metastatic ability of tumor cell. Further, treatment with DON decreased hyaluronan and collagen in the tumor microenvironment, leading to an extensive remodeling of the ECM, and an increased infiltration CD8+ T-cells. Additionally, treatment with DON sensitized pancreatic tumors to anti-PD1 therapy resulting in tumor regression and prolonged survival.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31607288>[Effect of Metformin on Proliferation Capacity, Apoptosis and  in K562 Cells].</a></h1><p>To investigate the effect of metformin on the proliferation, apoptosis and energy metabolism of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) K562 cells and the possible mechanism.Different doses (0, 5, 10, 20 and 30 mmol/L) of metformin was added into the K562 cells, which were cultivated for 24 h, 48 h and 72 h. The inverted optical microscope was used to observe the cell growth, CCK 8 was used to detect the cell vitality. The appropriate metformin doses (0, 10, 20 and 30 mmol/L) and the best time (48 h) were selected for subsequent experiments. The flow cytometer with Annexin V-FITC /PI doulde staining was used to detect apoptosis; the glucose detection kit and lactate detection kit were used to detect glucose consumption and lactate production; fluorescence quantitative PCR was used to detect -related gene expression, and Western blot was used to detect protein expression.Metformin inhibited the proliferation of K562 cells in a dose-dependent manner (r=0.92), and the relative survival in the 30 mmol/L group was as low as 19.84% at 72 h. When treated with metformin for 48 h, the apoptosis rates of 0, 10, 20 and 30 mmol/L groups were 5.14%, 12.19%, 26.29% and 35.5%, respectively. Compared with the control group, the glucose consumption and lactate secretion of K562 cells treated with metformin were significantly reduced (P<0.05), and showed a dose-dependent effect(r=0.94,r=0.93,respectively). Metformin inhibited the expression of GLUT1, LDHA, ALDOA, PDK1, and PGK1 genes of K562 cells (P<0.05) showing a dose-dependent manner(r=0.83，r=0.80，r=0.72，r=0.76，r=0.73,respectively).

Early events in phagocytic cells such as dendritic cells are not only key to establishing parasite infection, but conversely play a pivotal role in initiating host immunity. It is now recognized that in addition to changes in canonical immune markers and mediators, alteration in metabolism occurs upon activation of phagocytic cells. These metabolic changes are important for supporting the developing immune response, but can affect the availability of nutrients for intracellular pathogens including . However, the interaction of  with these cells and particularly how infection changes their metabolism has not been extensively investigated. Herein, we use a multi-omics approach comprising transcriptomics and metabolomics validated with functional assays to better understand early events in these cells following infection. Analysis of the transcriptome of  infected bone marrow derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) revealed significant alterations in transcripts associated with cellular metabolism, activation of T cells, inflammation mediated chemokine and cytokine signaling pathways. Multivariant analysis of metabolomic data sets acquired through non-targeted liquid chromatography mass spectroscopy (LCMS) identified metabolites associated with , the TCA cycle, oxidative phosphorylation and arginine metabolism as major discriminants between control uninfected and  infected cells. Consistent with these observations, glucose uptake and lactate dehydrogenase activity were upregulated in  infected BMDC cultures compared with control BMDCs. Conversely, BMDC mitochondrial membrane potential was reduced in -infected cells relative to mitochondria of control BMDCs. These changes to energy metabolism, similar to what has been described following LPS stimulation of BMDCs and macrophages are often termed the Warburg effect. This metabolic reprogramming of cells has been suggested to be an important adaption that provides energy and precursors to facilitate phagocytosis, antigen processing and cytokine production. Other changes to BMDC metabolism are evident following  infection and include upregulation of arginine degradation concomitant with increased arginase-1 activity and ornithine and proline production. As  is an arginine auxotroph the resultant reduced cellular arginine levels are likely to curtail parasite multiplication. These results highlight the complex interplay of BMDCs and parasite metabolism within the developing immune response and the consequences for adaptive immunity and pathogen clearance.Copyright © 2019 Hargrave, Woods, Millington, Chalmers, Westrop and Roberts.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649131>EVI1 triggers metabolic reprogramming associated with leukemogenesis and increases sensitivity to L-asparaginase.</a></h1><p>Metabolic reprogramming of leukemia cells is important for survival, proliferation, and drug resistance under conditions of metabolic stress in the bone marrow. Deregulation of cellular metabolism, leading to development of leukemia, occurs through abnormally high expression of transcription factors such as MYC and Ecotropic Virus Integration site 1 protein homolog (EVI1). Overexpression of EVI1 in adults and children with mixed lineage leukemia-rearrangement acute myeloid leukemia (MLL-r AML) has a very poor prognosis. To identify a metabolic inhibitor for EVI1-induced metabolic reprogramming in MLL-r AML, we used an XFp extracellular flux analyzer to examine metabolic changes during leukemia development in mouse models of AML expressing MLL-AF9 and Evi1 (Evi1/MF9). Oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) in Evi1/MF9 AML cells accelerated prior to activation of , with a higher dependency on glutamine as an energy source. Furthermore, EVI1 played a role in  as well as driving production of metabolites in the tricarboxylic acid cycle. L-asparaginase (L-asp) exacerbated growth inhibition induced by glutamine starvation and suppressed OXPHOS and proliferation of Evi1/MF9 both in vitro and in vivo; high sensitivity to L-asp was caused by low expression of asparagine synthetase (ASNS) and L-asp-induced suppression of glutamine metabolism. Also, samples from patients with EVI1+MF9 showed low ASNS expression, suggesting that it is a sensitive marker of L-asp treatment. Clarification of metabolic reprogramming in EVI1+ leukemia cells may aid development of treatments for EVI1+MF9 refractory leukemia.Copyright © 2019, Ferrata Storti Foundation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31634482>3-Mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase disruption in dermal fibroblasts facilitates adipogenic trans-differentiation.</a></h1><p>Transitioning from a differentiated state to a higher-order of plasticity, by partial rather than full reactivation of pluripotency genes, might be a better approach in regenerative medicine. Hydrogen sulfide plays a crucial role in the maintenance and differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) that have the potential to differentiate to a diverse group of mesenchymally derived cells. It was shown that these cells show a heavy reliance on cystathionine-β-synthase (CBS)-derived hydrogen sulfide (HS) during differentiation. We have found that expression and activity of 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (MPST), one of three enzymes that hat regulates HS biosynthesis, is significantly lower in MSC as compared with lineage-restricted dermal fibroblasts. Here, we tested the hypothesis that suppression of MPST in dermal fibroblasts might induce plasticity-related changes and broaden the transdifferentiation potency. Inactivation of MPST with phenylpyruvate (PP) or by siRNA silencing led to diminished HS production associated with increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lactic acid. Accumulation of α-ketoglutarate (α-KG), a key metabolite required for the expression of ten-eleven translocation hydroxylase (TET), was associated with stimulated transcription of pluripotency related genes including OCT4, KLF4, SOX2, and NANOG. Suppression of TET1 gene and inhibition of  with glucose analog, 2-desoxy-d-glucose, or hexokinase II inhibitor significantly reduced expression of pluripotency genes following MPST inactivation or knockdown. MPST disruption promoted the conversion of fibroblasts into adipocytes as evidenced by a significant increase in expression of adipocyte-specific genes, PPARγ, and UCP1, and intracellular accumulation of oil Red-O positive fat droplets. Inhibition of  inhibited these changes. Under induced differentiation conditions, fibroblasts with disrupted MPST show the potency to differentiate to white adipogenic lineage. Thus, MPST inactivation or silencing enhances the plasticity of dermal fibroblasts in a TET1 and  dependent manner and promotes adipogenic transdifferentiation.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

In this study, we explored the effect and mechanism of action of epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), a major polyphenol in green tea, alone and in combination with current chemotherapeutics on pancreatic cancer cell growth, focusing on  metabolism. Moreover, we investigated whether EGCG's effect is dependent on its ability to induce reactive oxygen species (ROS). EGCG reduced pancreatic cancer cell growth in a concentration-dependent manner and the growth inhibition effect was further enhanced under glucose deprivation conditions. Mechanistically, EGCG induced ROS levels concentration-dependently. EGCG affected  by suppressing the extracellular acidification rate through the reduction of the activity and levels of the glycolytic enzymes phosphofructokinase and pyruvate kinase. Cotreatment with catalase abrogated EGCG's effect on phosphofructokinase and pyruvate kinase. Furthermore, EGCG sensitized gemcitabine to inhibit pancreatic cancer cell growth in vitro and in vivo. EGCG and gemcitabine, given alone, reduced pancreatic tumor xenograft growth by 40% and 52%, respectively, whereas the EGCG/gemcitabine combination reduced tumor growth by 67%.

In-depth research of gastric precancerous lesions (GPL) plays an important role in preventing the occurrence of gastric cancer. Meanwhile, traditional treatment provides a novel sight in the prevention of occurrence and development of gastric cancer. The current study was designed to assess the effects of therapy with Weipixiao (WPX) decoction on N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG)-induced GPL rats and the underlying molecular mechanisms. After 10-weeks treatment, all rats were sacrificed. Histopathological changes of gastric tissue were assessed via hematoxylin-eosin (HE) and High-iron diamine-Alcian blue-Periodic acid-Schiff (HID-AB-PAS) staining. To be fully evidenced, RT-qPCR, Western blot and immunohistochemistry were used to detect the expressions of LDHA, CD147, HIF-1α, MCT4, PI3K, AKT, mTOR and miRNA-34a, which were crucial factors for evaluating GPL in the aspect of  pathogenesis. According to the results of HE and HID-AB-PAS staining, it could be confirmed that MNNG-induced GPL rats were obviously reversed by WPX decoction. Additionally, the increased gene levels of LDHA, CD147, MCT4, PI3K, AKT, mTOR and HIF-1α in model group were down-regulated by WPX decoction, while miRNA-34a expression was decreased and up-regulated by WPX decoction. The significantly increased protein levels of LDHA, CD147, MCT4, PI3K, AKT, mTOR and HIF-1α induced by MNNG were attenuated in rats treated with WPX decoction. In brief, the findings of this study imply that abnormal  in MNNG-induced GPL rats was relieved by WPX decoction via regulation of the expressions of LDHA, CD147, HIF-1α, MCT4, PI3K, AKT, mTOR and miRNA-34a.Copyright © 2019.

It is now evident that mitochondria are involved in the malignant transformation, cell proliferation, aggression and metastatic behavior of prostate cancer (PC). Recent comprehensive analysis of the mitochondrial oncobioenergetic (MOB) profile of PC cells using microplate-based high resolution respirometry has clearly demonstrated that characteristic MOB alterations occur at different stages of PC development. Additionally, studies have reported that modification of the MOB profile significantly inhibits the growth of malignant cells. This observation suggests that dynamic alterations in the MOB function are a critical component in the development of malignant disease of the prostate. Therefore, quantification of MOB function may be a good marker for the prediction of tumor stage. Future studies may develop novel approaches to measure oncobioenergetics of tumors with minimal invasive procedures effectively in men to determine the general prostate health and tumor staging, and to predict whether a tumor will proceed to malignancy in patients.

The activity and acetylation of upstream stimulatory factor (USF-1) and glycolytic enzymes were analyzed.Dietary garcinol significantly decreased (P < 0.05) concentrations of hepatic and plasma TG (27.1-45.8%) and total cholesterol (25.3-49.5%), plasma free fatty acids (24.4-37.8%), and hepatic pyruvate (31.5-43.5%) and lactate (33.4-65.7%) in mid-to-late pregnant rats. Garcinol promoted (P < 0.05) antioxidant capacity in the liver and plasma by 27.4-32.1%. Garcinol downregulated (P < 0.05) lipid synthesis-related enzyme expression by 30.6-85.3% and decreased (P < 0.05) glycolytic enzyme activities by 22.5-74.6% and PCAF activity by 18.6-55.4%. Transfection of PCAF siRNAs to hepatocytes of pregnant rats decreased USF-1 and glycolytic enzyme activities by PCAF; garcinol treatment downregulated (P < 0.05) the acetylation and activities of USF-1 and glycolytic enzymes by 35.6-83.7%.Garcinol attenuates hepatic pyruvate and TG accumulation in the liver of mid-to-late pregnant rats, which may be due to downregulating the acetylation of USF-1 and the glycolytic enzymes induced by PCAF in isolated hepatocytes.Copyright © American Society for Nutrition 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31581056>Metabolic crosstalk in the breast cancer microenvironment.</a></h1><p>During tumorigenesis, breast tumour cells undergo metabolic reprogramming, which generally includes enhanced , tricarboxylic acid cycle activity, glutaminolysis and fatty acid biosynthesis. However, the extension and functional importance of these metabolic alterations may diverge not only according to breast cancer subtypes, but also depending on the interaction of cancer cells with the complex surrounding microenvironment. This microenvironment comprises a variety of non-cancerous cells, such as immune cells (e.g. macrophages, lymphocytes, natural killer cells), fibroblasts, adipocytes and endothelial cells, together with extracellular matrix components and soluble factors, which influence cancer progression and are predictive of clinical outcome. The continuous interaction between cancer and stromal cells results in metabolic competition and symbiosis, with oncogenic-driven metabolic reprogramming of cancer cells shaping the metabolism of neighbouring cells and vice versa. This review addresses current knowledge on this metabolic crosstalk within the breast tumour microenvironment (TME). Improved understanding of how metabolism in the TME modulates cancer development and evasion of tumour-suppressive mechanisms may provide clues for novel anticancer therapeutics directed to metabolic targets.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Thus mechanisms of bacterial resistance to CLPs are thought to modify cell surfaces. However, we found that bacterial resistance to CLPs was strongly related to energy metabolism. Using polymyxin B (PB) as a model of CLPs, we showed that PB causes malfunction of respiration and serious depletion of ATP, contributing to PB-induced cell death and carbon starvation. Glucose addition could maintain the intracellular ATP level and reverse the carbon starvation response resulting from PB treatment. Another study revealed that  was stimulated by the presence of PB and glucose. The mechanism underlying glucose-enabled CLPs' resistance suggests that glucose could maintain the ATP level in PB-treated bacteria by enhancing . Similar results were observed in Staphylococcus aureus, where daptomycin resistance was enhanced by glucose. These findings provide insight into the mode of action of CLPs and resistance to these antibiotics.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier Inc.

In the present study, 20% CO was applied to strawberry fruit to investigate the regulation of elevated CO on aromatic secondary metabolites. The results showed that elevated CO delayed accumulations of anthocyanins, eugenol and lignin. Phenylalanine and tyrosine, the precursors of the above secondary metabolites, were 18.90% and 35.61%, respectively, lower in CO-treated fruit compared with the control on day 6. Furthermore, enzyme activities and transcriptional profiles analysis showed pentose phosphate pathway and  were activated by elevated CO whereas the aromatic amino acids (AAAs) pathway was inhibited. These results indicated that elevated CO restricted carbon flux into aromatic secondary metabolism by inhibiting the AAAs pathway, leading to the decrease of phenylalanine and tyrosine, and thus, delayed the accumulation of aromatic secondary metabolites. In addition, the effect of elevated CO was eliminated after transferred CO-treated fruit to air.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Therefore, identification of flooding tolerance genes has great significance in production practice. In this study, Qihuang 34, a highly-resistant variety to flooding stress, was selected for submergence treatments. Transcriptome and proteome analyses were conducted, by which twenty-two up-regulated differentially expressed genes (DEGs)/differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) associated with five KEGG pathways were isolated. The number of the DEGs/DEPs enriched in /gluconeogenesis was the highest. Four of these genes were confirmed by RT-qPCR, suggesting that /gluconeogenesis may be activated to generate energy for plant survival under anaerobic conditions. Thirty-eight down-regulated DEGs/DEPs associated with six KEGG pathways were identified under submergence stress. Eight DEGs/DEPs enriched in phenylpropanoid biosynthesis were assigned to peroxidase, which catalyzes the conversion of coumaryl alcohol to hydroxy-phenyl lignin in the final step of lignin biosynthesis. Three of these genes were confirmed by RT-qPCR. The decreased expression of these genes led to the inhibition of lignin biosynthesis, which may be the cause of plant softening under submergence stress for a long period of time. This study revealed a number of up-/down-regulated pathways and the corresponding DEGs/DEPs, by which, a better understanding of the mechanisms of submergence tolerance in soybean may be achieved.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662957>Computational Identification of Metabolic Pathways of  using the -Shortest Path Algorithm.</a></h1><p>, a malaria pathogen, has shown substantial resistance to treatment coupled with poor response to some vaccines thereby requiring urgent, holistic, and broad approach to prevent this endemic disease. Understanding the biology of the malaria parasite has been identified as a vital approach to overcome the threat of malaria. This study is aimed at identifying essential proteins unique to malaria parasites using a reconstructed  genome-scale metabolic model (GEM) of the 3D7 strain of  by filling gaps in the model with nineteen (19) metabolites and twenty-three (23) reactions obtained from the MetaCyc database. Twenty (20) currency metabolites were removed from the network because they have been identified to produce shortcuts that are biologically infeasible. The resulting modified  GEM was a model using the -shortest path algorithm to identify possible alternative metabolic pathways in  and pentose phosphate pathways of . Heuristic function was introduced for the optimal performance of the algorithm. To validate the prediction, the essentiality of the reactions in the reconstructed network was evaluated using betweenness centrality measure, which was applied to every reaction within the pathways considered in this study. Thirty-two (32) essential reactions were predicted among which our method validated fourteen (14) enzymes already predicted in the literature. The enzymatic proteins that catalyze these essential reactions were checked for homology with the host genome, and two (2) showed insignificant similarity, making them possible drug targets.

Sedentary behavior is associated with atherosclerosis and cardiovascular diseases (CVD). We examined whether reducing sedentary behavior and improving walking time improves monocyte inflammatory phenotype in subjects with increased cardiovascular risk. Methods and Results Across 2 waves, 16 individuals with increased cardiovascular risk performed a 16-week intervention study (age 64±6 years, body mass index 29.9±4.3 kg/m), using a device with vibration feedback to promote physical activity. Before and after intervention, we objectively examined physical activity (ActivPAL), cytokine production capacity after ex vivo stimulation in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, metabolism of peripheral blood mononuclear cells, circulating cytokine concentrations, and monocyte immunophenotype. Overall, no significant increase in walking time was found (1.9±0.7 to 2.2±1.2 h/day, =0.07). However, strong, inverse correlations were observed between the change in walking time and the change in production of interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10 after lipopolysaccharide stimulation (=-0.655, -0.844, -0.672, and -0.781, respectively, all <0.05). After intervention optimization based on feedback from wave 1, participants in wave 2 (n=8) showed an increase in walking time (2.2±0.8 to 3.0±1.3 h/day, =0.001) and attenuated cytokine production of IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10 (all <0.05).  (=0.08) and maximal OXPHOS (=0.04) of peripheral blood mononuclear cells decreased after intervention. Lower IL-6 concentrations (=0.06) and monocyte percentages (<0.05), but no changes in monocyte subsets were found. Conclusions Successfully improving walking time shifts innate immune function towards a less proinflammatory state, characterized by a lower capacity to produce inflammatory cytokines, in individuals with increased cardiovascular risk.

Cancer cells overexpress CD98hc-transporters in order to meet their increased nutritional and antioxidant demands, since they provide branched-chain AA (BCAA) and aromatic AA (AAA) availability while protecting cells from oxidative stress. Here we show that BCAA and AAA shortage phenocopies the inhibition of mTORC1 signalling, protein synthesis and cell proliferation caused by CD98hc ablation. Furthermore, our data indicate that CD98hc sustains glucose uptake and , and, as a consequence, the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). Thus, loss of CD98hc triggers a dramatic reduction in the nucleotide pool, which leads to replicative stress in these cells, as evidenced by the enhanced DNA Damage Response (DDR), S-phase delay and diminished rate of mitosis, all recovered by nucleoside supplementation. In addition, proper BCAA and AAA availability sustains the expression of the enzyme ribonucleotide reductase. In this regard, BCAA and AAA shortage results in decreased content of deoxynucleotides that triggers replicative stress, also recovered by nucleoside supplementation. On the basis of our findings, we conclude that CD98hc plays a central role in AA and glucose cellular nutrition, redox homeostasis and nucleotide availability, all key for cell proliferation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31642809>Discovery proteomics in aging human skeletal muscle finds change in spliceosome, immunity, proteostasis and mitochondria.</a></h1><p>A decline of skeletal muscle strength with aging is a primary cause of mobility loss and frailty in older persons, but the molecular mechanisms of such decline are not understood. Here, we performed quantitative proteomic analysis from skeletal muscle collected from 58 healthy persons aged 20 to 87 years. In muscle from older persons, ribosomal proteins and proteins related to energetic metabolism, including those related to the TCA cycle, mitochondria respiration, and , were underrepresented, while proteins implicated in innate and adaptive immunity, proteostasis, and alternative splicing were overrepresented. Consistent with reports in animal models, older human muscle was characterized by deranged energetic metabolism, a pro-inflammatory environment and increased proteolysis.

Blocking the glycolytic pathway has been suggested as a therapeutic strategy to impair the proliferation of tumor cells. Metformin, a widely used anti-diabetes drug, exhibits anti-tumor properties. However, the underlying molecular mechanism of its action linking glucose metabolism with the suppression of proliferation has not been fully clarified.Stable isotope tracing technology and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry method were utilized to analyze the effect of metformin on glycolytic flux in HCC cells. Western blot and immunohistochemistry were utilized to analyze the expression of phosphofructokinase-1 (PFK1) and 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2,6-biphosphatase 3 (PFKFB3) in HCC cells or xenograft tumor tissues. Lactate measurement and glucose uptake assay were used to analyze the level of lactate and glucose in the presence of frucose-2,6-diphosphate (F2,6BP) in HCC cells treated with metformin.We found that metformin significantly impaired hepatoma cell proliferation by inhibiting the glycolytic flux via PFK1 blockade. Interestingly, activation of PFK1 by F2,6BP reverses the inhibitory effect of metformin on hepatoma cell proliferation and . Mechanistically, PFKFB3，a potent allosteric activator of PFK1, was markedly suppressed through inhibiting hypoxia-induced factor 1 (HIF-1α) accumulation mediated by metformin.Taken together these data indicate that HIF-1α/PFKFB3/PFK1 regulatory axis is a vital determinant of glucose metabolic reprogramming in hepatocellular carcinoma, which gives new insights into the action of metformin in combatting liver cancer.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

In an effort to better understand this process we found an intersection of Nrf2/NLE2F2 (Nrf2), epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT), and metabolic alterations using multiple in vitro and in vivo approaches. Nrf2 is a key transcription factor controlling the expression of redox regulators to establish cellular redox homeostasis. Nrf2 has been shown to exert both cancer inhibitory and stimulatory activities. Using multiple isogenic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines, we observed a reduction of Nrf2 protein and activity in a prometastatic mesenchymal cell state and increased reactive oxygen species. Knockdown of Nrf2 promoted a mesenchymal phenotype and reduced glycolytic, TCA cycle and lipogenic output from both glucose and glutamine in the isogenic cell models; while overexpression of Nrf2 promoted a more epithelial phenotype and metabolic reactivation. In both Nrf2 knockout mice and in NSCLC patient samples, Nrf2 was co-correlated with markedly decreased expression of glycolytic, lipogenic, and mesenchymal RNAs. Conversely, Nrf2 was associated with partial mesenchymal epithelial transition and increased expression of metabolic RNAs. The impact of Nrf2 on epithelial and mesenchymal cancer cell states and metabolic output provide an additional context to Nrf2 function in cancer initiation and progression, with implications for therapeutic inhibition of Nrf2 in cancer treatment.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662475>An allosteric PGAM1 inhibitor effectively suppresses pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.</a></h1><p>Glycolytic enzyme phosphoglycerate mutase 1 (PGAM1) plays a critical role in cancer metabolism by coordinating  and biosynthesis. A well-validated PGAM1 inhibitor, however, has not been reported for treating pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), which is one of the deadliest malignancies worldwide. By uncovering the elevated PGAM1 expressions were statistically related to worse prognosis of PDAC in a cohort of 50 patients, we developed a series of allosteric PGAM1 inhibitors by structure-guided optimization. The compound KH3 significantly suppressed proliferation of various PDAC cells by down-regulating the levels of  and mitochondrial respiration in correlation with PGAM1 expression. Similar to PGAM1 depletion, KH3 dramatically hampered the canonic pathways highly involved in cancer metabolism and development. Additionally, we observed the shared expression profiles of several signature pathways at 12 h after treatment in multiple PDAC primary cells of which the matched patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models responded similarly to KH3 in the 2 wk treatment. The better responses to KH3 in PDXs were associated with higher expression of PGAM1 and longer/stronger suppressions of cancer metabolic pathways. Taken together, our findings demonstrate a strategy of targeting cancer metabolism by PGAM1 inhibition in PDAC.

Hyaluronan (HA) is a glycosaminoglycan, found in the extracellular matrix, which is synthesized by HA synthases (Has1/Has2/Has3) from sugar precursors and accumulates in diabetic conditions. Its synthesis can be inhibited by the small molecule 4-methylumbelliferone (4-MU).

The objective of this study was to investigate the feasibilities of waste Monascus fermentation broth medium (MFBM) toward heterotrophic Chlorella protothecoides-enriched lutein. The results indicated that C. protothecoides subjected to MFBM batch feeding achieved 7.1 g/L biomass and 7.27 mg/g lutein. The resulting lutein productivity (7.34 mg/L/day) represented 1.54-fold more than that of frequently used Basal medium. Concurrently, the effective metabolism and absorption of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus in MFBM by C. subellipsoidea cultivation make it easily complied with the permissible dischargeable limits for fermentation broth. When response to fed-batch culture mode, the biomass and lutein productivity peaked 20.4 g/L and 9.11 mg/L/day with concentrated MFBM feeding. Transcriptomics data hinted that MFBM feeding manipulated lutein biosynthesis key checkpoints (e.g., lycopene β-cyclase and lycopene ε-cyclase) while accelerated energy pathways (e.g.,  and TCA cycle) to contribute such high lutein productivity in C. protothecoides.

Co-expression of additional EMP enzymes, fructose bisphosphate aldolase (Fba) and triose phosphate isomerase (Tpi), with Pfk I did not enable EMP flux, and resulted in production of glycerol as a side product.

However, the accurate role of VersicanV1, a predominant isoform of Versican in liver, remains an enigma in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The expression of VersicanV1 in HCC tissues and adjacent tissues was detected by Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR), Western Blot (WB) and inmumohistochemistry (IHC).

RNA sequencing, Co-IP (Co-immunoprecipitation) and MS (mass spectrometry) were utilized to investigate the molecular mechanisms. Our current study reveals that VersicanV1, regulated by direct interaction with Linc01225, is significantly upregulated in HCC tissues and correlates with poor prognosis. Both in vitro and in vivo experiments show that knockdown of VersicanV1 in HCC cells attenuates cancer cells malignancy. Further studies identify the positive role of VersicanV1 in aerobic .

In recent years, it has become increasingly clear that the processes underlying proper T cell activation, proliferation, and differentiation require well-tuned and dynamic changes in T cell metabolism. Thus, proper metabolic reprogramming in T cells is crucial to ensure proper immunity in the context of infection and anti-tumor immunity. Conversely, aberrant regulation of T cell metabolism can impair T cell function and thereby contribute to T cell-mediated disease. In this review, the relevance of recent insights into T cell metabolism for prototypical T cell-mediated skin diseases will be discussed and their therapeutic potential will be outlined. First, the major modules of T cell metabolism are summarized. Then, the importance of T cell metabolism for T cell-mediated skin diseases such as psoriasis and allergic contact dermatitis is discussed, based on the current state of our understanding thereof.

However, the effects of various storage temperatures (25°C, 15°C, 4°C and -1.5°C) on the phosphorylation level of protein are poorly understood. Changes in the protein phosphorylation levels in postmortem ovine muscle at various storage temperatures were determined in this study.The obtained data showed that pH decline rate was significantly inhibited at -1.5°C from 12 h to 7 d postmortem (P < 0.05). The ATP consumption rate was higher at 25°C than that at other three temperatures (P < 0.05). Analysis of the temperature, pH and ATP content revealed that the ATP content was related to the phosphorylation levels of individual protein bands.

Effects of PM2.5 and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) on differentiation of T-helper 17/T-regulatory (Th17/T) cells were investigated by flow cytometry and quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. Mechanisms were investigated by mRNA sequencing, chromatin immunoprecipitation, bisulfite sequencing and  rates.PM2.5 impaired differentiation of T cells, promoted differentiation of Th17 cells, and aggravated asthma in an AhR-dependent manner. PM2.5 and one of its prominent PAHs, indeno[1,2,3-cd]pyrene (IP), promoted differentiation of Th17 cells by up-regulating hypoxia-inducible factor-1α expression and enhancing  via AhRs. Exposure to PM2.5 and IP enhanced glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (Got)1 expression via AhRs and accumulation of R-2-hydroxyglutarate, which inhibited ten-eleven translocation methylcytosine dioxygenase-2 activity, resulting in hypermethylation in the forkhead box p3 locus and impaired differentiation of T cells. A Got1 inhibitor, (aminooxy)acetic acid, ameliorated asthma by shifting differentiation of Th17 cells to T cells. Similar regulatory effects of exposure to PM2.5 or IP on Th17/T imbalance were noted in human T cells and, in a case-control design, PAH exposure appeared to be a potential risk factor for asthma.The molecular pathways AhR-HIF-1α and AhR-Got1 mediate pulmonary responses upon exposure to PM2.5 through their ability to disturb the balance of Th17/T cells.Copyright © 2019.

Receiver-operating-characteristic analysis was used to analyze the correlation of PET parameters cutoff values with deep myometrial invasion (MI), lymphovascular space involvement and LNM for prognostic values in risk stratification.The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and accuracy for detection of LNM are 83.3%, 99.7%, 90.9%, 99.5% and 99.2%, respectively. The MTV and TLG of primary lesion of EC in the patients with LNM are notably higher than those in patients without LNM, p<0.010. The MTV and TLG of the EC primary lesions in high-risk patients are significantly higher than those in low-risk patients (p<0.010), but the maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) is not. The MTV and TLG of primary lesions were superior to SUVmax for predicting of deep MI, LNM and high-risk of EC (p<0.005).MTV and TLG of primary lesions are more valuable in predicting risk stratification of EC patients. Preoperative ¹⁸F-FDG PET/CT imaging is useful in predicting the LNM of EC and may help guide pelvic lymphadenectomy to avoid unnecessary pelvic lymphadenectomy in EC patients with low-risk stratification.Copyright © 2019.

Little is known about the physiological and molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of short-term repression of N metabolism on tea roots and leaves for a short time.In this study, we subjected tea plants to a specific inhibitor of glutamine synthetase (GS), methionine sulfoximine (MSX), for a short time (30 min) and investigated the effect of the inhibition of N metabolism on the transcriptome and metabolome of quality-related compounds. Our results showed that GS activities in tea roots and leaves were significantly inhibited upon MSX treatment, and both tissue types showed a sensitive metabolic response to GS inhibition. In tea leaves, the hydrolysis of theanine decreased with the increase in theanine and free ammonium content. The biosynthesis of all other amino acids was repressed, and the content of N-containing lipids declined, suggesting that short-term inhibition of GS reduces the level of N reutilization in tea leaves. Metabolites related to  and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle accumulated after GS repression, whereas the content of amino acids such as glycine, serine, isoleucine, threonine, leucine, and valine declined in the MXS treated group. We speculate that the biosynthesis of amino acids is affected by  and the TCA cycle in a feedback loop.Overall, our data suggest that GS repression in tea plant leads to the reprogramming of amino acid and lipid metabolic pathways.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31611881>The Metabolic Requirements of Th2 Cell Differentiation.</a></h1><p>Upon activation, naïve CD4 T cells differentiate into a number of specialized T helper (Th) cell subsets. Th2 cells are central players in immunity to helminths and are implicated in mediating the inflammatory pathology associated with allergies. The differentiation of Th2 cells is dependent on transcription factors such as GATA3 and STAT6, which prime Th2 cells for the secretion of interleukin- (IL-) 4, IL-5, and IL-13. Several lines of work now suggest that differentiating Th2 cells in the lymph node are potent IL-4 cytokine producers, but do not become competent IL-5- and IL-13-producing cells until after receiving cues from non-lymphoid tissue. It is evident that Th2 cells that enter tissues undergo considerable changes in chromatin architecture and gene expression, and that over this time, the metabolic requirements of these cells change considerably. Herein, we discuss the metabolic requirements of Th2 cells during their early and late differentiation, focusing on the impact of glucose and lipid metabolism, mTOR activation, the nuclear receptor PPAR-γ and several metabolites.Copyright © 2019 Stark, Tibbitt and Coquet.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31609200> macrophages switch to aerobic  to mount effective antibacterial defense.</a></h1><p>Macrophage-mediated phagocytosis and cytokine production represent the front lines of resistance to bacterial invaders. A key feature of this pro-inflammatory response in mammals is the complex remodeling of cellular metabolism towards aerobic .

Here we used the adult fruit fly  to investigate the metabolic changes that occur in macrophages during the acute and resolution phases of -induced sepsis. Our studies revealed that orthologs of the Hypoxia inducible factor 1α (HIF1α) and Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) are required for macrophage activation, their bactericidal function, and resistance to infection, thus documenting conservation of this cellular response between insect and mammals.

Tianshu capsule (TSC), composed of Chuanxiong (Ligusticum chuanxiong Hort) and Tianma (Gastrodiaelata Blume), has been widely used to treat the blood stasis type of headache and migraine in clinic. Results of previous research showed its antihypertensive effects, but the underlying mechanisms were still unclear. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the antihypertensive effect of TSC on spontaneously hypertensive rats by H NMR-based metabonomics and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELIAS), explore potential biomarkers and targets, and probe the potential mechanism of TSC on antihypertensive treatment. The results showed that TSC could decrease the product of oxidative stress (MDA) and enhance the activities of SOD and GSH-Px, down-regulate the expression of enzymes (LDHA, PKM2 and HK2) related to , and perturb the levels of a series of amino acids (isoleucine, alanine, asparagine, citrate, etc.) and pathways. Multivariate statistical analyses showed remarkable changes in some endogenous metabolites after administrating TSC related to oxidative stress, amino acid metabolism and energy metabolism disturbances. Some enzymes (alanine-glyoxylate aminotransferase-2, tyrosine hydroxylase, dopa decarboxylase, etc.) related to metabolic biomarkers were predicted as the potential targets of TSC treatment on SHRs. The discoveries are helpful to understand the antihypertensive mechanism of TSC and provide theoretical evidence for its future research, development and clinical use.Copyright © 2019 Gao, Wang, Wang, Wang, Wang, Ma, Li, Zhao and Chen.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31611300>Localisation of PGK1 determines metabolic phenotype to balance metastasis and proliferation in patients with SMAD4-negative pancreatic cancer.</a></h1><p>Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the most aggressive type of GI tumour, and it possesses deregulated cellular energetics. Although recent advances in PDAC biology have led to the discovery of recurrent genetic mutations in ,  and , which are related to this disease, clinical application of the molecular phenotype of PDAC remains challenging.We combined molecular imaging technology (positron emission tomography/CT) and immunohistochemistry to evaluate the correlation between the maximum standardised uptake value and SMAD4 expression and examined the effect of SMAD4 on  through in vitro and in vivo experiments. Furthermore, we identified the effect of SMAD4 on metabolic reprogramming by metabolomics and glucose metabolism gene expression analyses. Dual luciferase reporter assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation were performed to identify whether SMAD4 functioned as a transcription factor for phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (PGK1) in PDAC cells. Proliferative and metastatic assays were performed to examine the effect of PGK1 on the malignant behaviour of PDAC.We provide compelling evidence that the glycolytic enzyme PGK1 is repressed by transforming growth factor-β/SMAD4. Loss of SMAD4 induces PGK1 upregulation in PDAC, which enhances  and aggressive tumour behaviour. Notably, in SMAD4-negative PDAC, nuclear PGK1 preferentially drives cell metastasis via mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation induction, whereas cytoplasmic PGK1 preferentially supports proliferation by functioning as a glycolytic enzyme. The PDAC progression pattern and distinct PGK1 localisation combine to predict overall survival and disease-free survival.PGK1 is a decisive oncogene in patients with SMAD4-negative PDAC and can be a target for the development of a therapeutic strategy for SMAD4-negative PDAC.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

We evaluated the performance of an automatic multi-foci segmentation method of quantification (MFS) in patients with different stages of Hodgkin`s Lymphoma, using the multiple VOI method (MV) as reference.  This prospective bicentric study included 50 patients with Hodgkin's Lymphoma who underwent staging F-FGD PET/CT. The exams were centrally reviewed and processed with commercial MFS software in order to obtain MTV and TLG utilizing two fixed relative thresholds (40% and 20% of the maximum standardized uptake value) of each lesion. All PET/CTs were processed using the MV and MFS methods. Inter-class correlation coefficient and Bland & Altman plots were used for statistical analysis. Repeated calculations of MTV and TLG values by two observers with different degrees of PET/CT imaging experience were used to access interobserver agreement of the MFS method.  The mean and standard deviation values obtained for the MTV with MV and MFS were respectively 736mL ± 856mL and 660mL ± 699mL for the 20% threshold, and 313mL ± 359mL and 372mL ± 434mL for the 40% threshold. The time spent calculating the MTV was much shorter with the MFS than with the MV method (median time: 11.6 min. [1-30 min] and 64.4min. [1-240 min], respectively), especially in patients with advanced disease. Time spent was similar in patients with localized disease. There were no statistical differences between the MFS values obtained by the two different observers.  MTV and TLG calculations using MFS are reproducible, generate similar results to those obtained with MV and are much less timing consuming. Main differences between the two methods were related to difficulties in avoiding overlay of VOIs in the MV technique. MV and MFS perform equally well in in patients with small number of lesions.Copyright © 2019 by the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671345>Overexpression of lncRNA EPB41L4A-AS1 Induces Metabolic Reprogramming in Trophoblast Cells and Placenta Tissue of Miscarriage.</a></h1><p>Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been shown to be crucial regulators in numerous human diseases. However, little is known about their effects on early recurrent miscarriage (RM). Here we aimed to investigate the role of lncRNA EPB41L4A-AS1 on placental trophoblast cell metabolic reprogramming, which might be involved in the pathogenesis of RM. After microarray and GEO database analyses, we found that EPB41L4A-AS1 was significantly increased in early RM placental tissue, and this increase may relate to estradiol-mediated upregulation of PGC-1α. EPB41L4A-AS1 overexpression inhibits  but increases the dependence on fatty acid oxidation in mitochondrion metabolism and suppresses the Warburg effect, which is necessary for rapid growth of the placental villus, leading to miscarriage. Mechanistic analyses demonstrated that EPB41L4A-AS1 functions as a lncRNA in the regulation of VDAC1 and HIF-1α expression through enhancement of H3K4me3 levels in the promoters of VDAC1 and HIF1A-AS1, a natural antisense transcript (NAT) lncRNA of HIF-1α. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that aberrant expression of EPB41L4A-AS1 is involved in the etiology of early RM, and it may be a candidate diagnostic hallmark and a potential therapeutic target for early RM treatment.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

However, fast growing phenotypes usually feature secretion of organic compounds. For example, E. coli mainly produced acetate in fast growing condition such as glucose rich and aerobic condition, which is troublesome for metabolic engineering because acetate causes acidification of surroundings, growth inhibition and decline of production yield. The overflow metabolism can be alleviated by reducing glucose uptake rate.As glucose transporters or their subunits were knocked out in E. coli, the growth and glucose uptake rates decreased and biomass yield was improved. Alteration of intracellular metabolism caused by the mutations was investigated with transcriptome analysis and C metabolic flux analysis (C MFA). Various transcriptional and metabolic perturbations were identified in the sugar transporter mutants. Transcription of genes related to , chemotaxis, and flagella synthesis was downregulated, and that of gluconeogenesis, Krebs cycle, alternative transporters, quorum sensing, and stress induced proteins was upregulated in the sugar transporter mutants. The specific production yields of value-added compounds (enhanced green fluorescent protein, γ-aminobutyrate, lycopene) were improved significantly in the sugar transporter mutants.The elimination of sugar transporter resulted in alteration of global gene expression and redirection of carbon flux distribution, which was purposed to increase energy yield and recycle carbon sources. When the pathways for several valuable compounds were introduced to mutant strains, specific yield of them were highly improved. These results showed that controlling the sugar uptake rate is a good strategy for ameliorating metabolite production.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655344>Culm transcriptome sequencing of Badila (Saccharum officinarum L.) and analysis of major genes involved in sucrose accumulation.</a></h1><p>Sugarcane is an important sugar and energy crop worldwide. It utilises highly efficient C4 photosynthesis and accumulates sucrose in its culms. The sucrose content in sugarcane culms is a quantitative trait controlled by multiple genes. The regulatory mechanism underlying the maximum sucrose level in sugarcane culms remains unclear. We used transcriptome sequences to identify the potential regulatory genes involved in sucrose accumulation in Saccarum officinarum L. cv. Badila. The sucrose accumulating internodes at the elongation and mature growth stage and the immature internodes with low sucrose content at the mature stage were used for RNA sequencing. The obtained differentially expressed genes (DEGs) related to sucrose accumulation were analysed. Results showed that the transcripts encoding invertase (beta-fructofuranosidase, EC: 3.2.1.26) which catalyses sucrose hydrolysis and 6-phosphofructokinase (PFK, EC: 2.7.1.11), a key  regulatory enzyme, were downregulated in the high sucrose accumulation internodes. The transcripts encoding key enzymes for ABA, gibberellin and ethylene synthesis were also downregulated during sucrose accumulation. Furthermore, regulated protein kinase, transcription factor and sugar transporter genes were also obtained. This research can clarify the molecular regulation network of sucrose accumulation in sugarcane.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Molecular characterization now plays a pivotal role, and IDH mutations are key characteristics and the subject of active debate. IDH-mutant tumors produce the 'onco-metabolite', 2-hydroxyglutarate. Metabolic changes have become central to the understanding of tumor biology, and tumors display a fundamental metabolic change called the Warburg Effect. The Warburg Effect represents a preference for , as opposed to oxidative phosphorylation. The present review details the clinical context and discusses clinical and preclinical metabolic imaging tools to characterize the Warburg Effect.A clinical Warburg Index is proposed, defined as the lactate concentration measured by H-MRSI over the SUV measured by FDG-PET, to measure the Warburg Effect. A preclinical technique called deuterium metabolic imaging has successfully imaged the Warburg Effect in vivo in glioblastoma.Metabolic imaging provides an opportunity to measure the Warburg Effect and other metabolic changes in brain tumors. An increased understanding of metabolic shifts integral to brain cancer has the potential to address multiple contemporary debates on glioma pathophysiology and treatment. Metabolic imaging tools thus have the potential to advance research findings, clinical trial development, and clinical care.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31610608>Citrobacter rodentium induces rapid and unique metabolic and inflammatory responses in mice suffering from severe disease.</a></h1><p>The mouse pathogen Citrobacter rodentium is used to model infections with enterohaemorrhagic and enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EHEC and EPEC). Pathogenesis is commonly modelled in mice developing mild disease (e.g., C57BL/6). However, little is known about host responses in mice exhibiting severe colitis (e.g., C3H/HeN), which arguably provide a more clinically relevant model for human paediatric enteric infection. Infection of C3H/HeN mice with C. rodentium results in rapid colonic colonisation, coinciding with induction of key inflammatory signatures and colonic crypt hyperplasia. Infection also induces dramatic changes to bioenergetics in intestinal epithelial cells, with transition from oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) to aerobic  and higher abundance of SGLT4, LDHA, and MCT4. Concomitantly, mitochondrial proteins involved in the TCA cycle and OXPHOS were in lower abundance. Similar to observations in C57BL/6 mice, we detected simultaneous activation of cholesterol biogenesis, import, and efflux. Distinctly, however, the pattern recognition receptors NLRP3 and ALPK1 were specifically induced in C3H/HeN. Using cell-based assays revealed that C. rodentium activates the ALPK1/TIFA axis, which is dependent on the ADP-heptose biosynthesis pathway but independent of the Type III secretion system. This study reveals for the first time the unfolding intestinal epithelial cells' responses during severe infectious colitis, which resemble EPEC human infections.© 2019 The Authors.

The protective role of the bioactive compounds sulforaphane and capsaicin against the effect of these stimuli leading to pro-carcinogenic features was also addressed. Sulforaphane and capsaicin decreased nuclear AR, prostate specific antigen and Bcl-XL levels, and cell proliferation induced by androgen and Tip60 in LNCaP cells. These bioactive compounds prevented the increase in , hexokinase and pyruvate kinase activity, and reduced HIF-1α stabilization induced by androgen and Tip60 in LNCaP cells.

The non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) diclofenac lowers lactate secretion of tumor cells and improves anti-PD1-induced T cell killing in vitro. Surprisingly, diclofenac, but not other NSAIDs, turns out to be a potent inhibitor of the lactate transporters monocarboxylate transporter 1 and 4 and diminishes lactate efflux. Notably, T cell activation, viability, and effector functions are preserved under diclofenac treatment and in a low glucose environment in vitro. Diclofenac, but not aspirin, delays tumor growth and improves the efficacy of checkpoint therapy in vivo. Moreover, genetic suppression of  in tumor cells strongly improves checkpoint therapy.

In our previous study, we showed bitter melon extract (BME) prevents carcinogen induced mouse oral cancer. RNA sequence analysis from mouse tongue revealed a significant modulation in "Metabolic Process" by altering  and lipid metabolic pathways in BME fed group as compared to cancer group. In present study, we evaluated the effect of BME on  and lipid metabolism pathways in human oral cancer cells.Cal27 and JHU022 cells were treated with BME. RNA and protein expression were analysed for modulation of glycolytic and lipogenesis genes by quantitative real-time PCR, western blot analyses and immunofluorescence. Lactate and pyruvate level was determined by GC/MS. Extracellular acidification and glycolytic rate were measured using the Seahorse XF analyser. Shotgun lipidomics in Cal27 and JHU022 cell lines following BME treatment was performed by ESI/ MS. ROS was measured by FACS.Treatment with BME on oral cancer cell lines significantly reduced mRNA and protein expression levels of key glycolytic genes SLC2A1 (GLUT-1), PFKP, LDHA, PKM and PDK3. Pyruvate and lactate levels and  rate were reduced in oral cancer cells following BME treatment. In lipogenesis pathway, we observed a significant reduction of genes involves in fatty acid biogenesis, ACLY, ACC1 and FASN, at the mRNA and protein levels following BME treatment. Further, BME treatment significantly reduced phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, and plasmenylethanolamine, and reduced iPLA2 activity. Additionally, BME treatment inhibited lipid raft marker flotillin expression and altered its subcellular localization. ER-stress associated CHOP expression and generation of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species were induced by BME, which facilitated apoptosis.Our study revealed that bitter melon extract inhibits  and lipid metabolism and induces ER and oxidative stress-mediated cell death in oral cancer. Thus, BME-mediated metabolic reprogramming of oral cancer cells will have important preventive and therapeutic implications along with conventional therapies.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31572169>Developmental Aspects of Glucose and Calcium Availability on the Persistence of Memory Function Over the Lifespan.</a></h1><p>An important aspect concerning the underlying nature of memory function is an understanding of how memories are acquired and lost. The stability, and ultimate demise, of memory over the lifespan of an organism remains a critical topic in determining the neurobiological mechanisms that mediate memory representations. This has important implications for the elucidation and treatment of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). One important question in the context of preserving functional plasticity over the lifespan is the determination of the neurobiological structural and functional changes that contribute to the formation of memory during the juvenile time frame that might provide protection against later memory dysfunction by promoting the establishment of redundant neural pathways. The main question being, if memory formation during the juvenile period does strengthen and preserve memory stability over the lifespan, what are the neurobiological structural or functional substrates that mediate this effect? One neural attribute whose function may be altered with early life experience and provide a mechanism to preserve memory through the lifespan is glucose transport-linked calcium (Ca) buffering. Because peak increases in glucose utilization overlap with a timeframe during which spatial training can enhance later memory processing, it might be the case that learning-associated changes in glucose utilization would provide an important neural functional change to preserve memory function throughout the lifespan. The glucose transporters are proteins that are reduced in AD pathology and there is evidence that glucose reductions can impair Ca buffering. In the absence of an appropriate supply of ATP, provided via glucose transport and , Ca levels can rise leading to neural vulnerability with ensuing pathological outcomes. In this review, we explore the hypothesis that enhancing glucose utilization with spatial training during the preadolescent period will provide a functional enhancement that regulates glucose-dependent Ca signaling during aging or neurodegeneration and provide essential neural resources to preserve functional plasticity and memory function.Copyright © 2019 Holahan, Tzakis and Oliveira.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668836>A high energy phosphate jump - From pyrophospho-inositol to pyrophospho-serine.</a></h1><p>Inositol pyrophosphates (PP-IPs) are a class of energy rich metabolites present in all eukaryotic cells. The hydroxyl groups on these water soluble derivatives of inositol are substituted with diphosphate and monophosphate moieties. Since the discovery of PP-IPs in the early 1990s, enormous progress has been made in uncovering pleiotropic roles for these small molecules in cellular physiology. PP-IPs exert their effect on proteins in two ways - allosteric regulation by direct binding, or post-translational regulation by serine pyrophosphorylation, a modification unique to PP-IPs. Serine pyrophosphorylation is achieved by Mg-dependent, but enzyme independent transfer of a β-phosphate from a PP-IP to a pre-phosphorylated serine residue located in an acidic motif, within an intrinsically disordered protein sequence. This distinctive post-translational modification has been shown to regulate diverse cellular processes, including rRNA synthesis, , and vesicle transport. However, our understanding of the molecular details of this phosphotransfer from pyrophospho-inositol to generate pyrophospho-serine, is still nascent. This review discusses our current knowledge of protein pyrophosphorylation, and recent advances in understanding the mechanism of this important yet overlooked post-translational modification.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

In the present study, we aimed to investigate the mechanism by which propofol attenuates tumor endothelial cells (TECs) and tumor cell adhesion to inhibit tumor metastasis in vitro. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium were treated with tumor conditioned medium for 24 h, followed by 4 h of treatment with or without 25 μM of propofol, 10 μM of KN93, 500 μM of MK801, or 20 μM of rapastinel. It was found that propofol inhibited TEC adhesion and the  level of TECs. Consistently, propofol inhibited the expressions of adhesion molecules (E-selectin, ICAM-1, and VCAM-1) and  proteins (GLUT1, HK2, and LDHA) in TECs. Moreover, propofol attenuated the expression of HIF-1α, the phosphorylation of AKT and Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII), and the Ca2+ concentration in TECs. MK801, an inhibitor of NMDA receptor, and KN93, an inhibitor of CaMKII, both inhibited the expressions of adhesion molecules and  proteins, in a manner similar to propofol. Additionally, rapastine, an activator of NMDA receptor, could counteract the effects of propofol. Our results indicated that propofol attenuates intracellular Ca2+ concentration, CaMKII and AKT phosphorylation, and HIF-1α expression, probably via inhibiting the NMDA receptor, thus inhibiting  and adhesion of tumor and endothelial cells.© The Author(s) 2019.

Previously, serial embryo transfer was used to classify heifers as high fertile (HF), subfertile (SF), or infertile (IF). Here, we investigated specific histotroph components (glucose, prostaglandins (PGs) and lipids) in the uterine lumen of day 17 pregnant and open fertility-classified heifers. Concentrations of glucose in the uterine lumen were increased by pregnancy, but did not differ among fertility-classified heifers. Differences in expression of genes encoding glucose transporters and involved with  and gluconeogenesis were observed between conceptuses collected from HF and SF heifers. In the uterine lumen, PGE2 and PGF2α were increased by pregnancy, and HF heifers had higher concentrations of PGE2, PGF2α and 6-keto-PFG1α than SF heifers. Differences were found in expression of genes regulating PG signaling, arachidonic acid metabolism, and PPAR signaling among conceptuses and endometrium from fertility-classified heifers. Lipidomics was conducted exclusively in samples from HF heifers, and phosphatidylcholine was the main lipid class that increased in the uterine lumen by pregnancy. Expression of several lipid metabolism genes differed between HF and SF conceptuses, and a number of fatty acids were differentially abundant in the uterine lumen of pregnant HF and SF heifers. These results support the ideas that uterine luminal histotroph impacts conceptus survival and programs its development and is a facet of dysregulated conceptus-endometrial interactions that result in loss of the conceptus in SF cattle during the implantation period of pregnancy establishment.© The Author(s) 2019.

The bifurcating [FeFe]-hydrogenase reaction has three competitive properties: 1) enabling NAD(P)H-driven proton reduction at pH higher than the concurrent operation of the two, non-bifurcating reactions, 2) oxidation of NAD(P)H and ferredoxin simultaneously in a 1:1 ratio, both are produced during typical glucose fermentations, and 3) enhanced energy conservation (~10 kJ mol H) relative to concurrent operation of the two, non-bifurcating reactions. Our analysis demonstrated ferredoxin E°' largely determines the sensitivity of the bifurcating reaction to pH, modulation of the reduced/oxidized electron carrier ratios contributed less to equilibria shifts. Hydrogenase thermodynamics data were integrated with typical and non-typical  pathways to evaluate achieving the 'Thauer limit' (4 H per glucose) as a function of temperature and pH. For instance, the bifurcating [FeFe]-hydrogenase reaction permits the Thauer limit at 60 °C if pH  ≤ ~10 mbar. The results also predict Archaea, expressing a non-typical  pathway, would not benefit from a bifurcating [FeFe]-hydrogenase reaction; interestingly, no Archaea have been observed experimentally with a [FeFe]-hydrogenase enzyme.Copyright © 2019.

IL-17-producing CD4 T (Th17) cells play pivotal roles in RA development and progression. Retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor alpha (RORα) is a negative regulator of inflammatory responses, whereas RORγt, another member of the ROR family, is a Th17 lineage-specific transcription factor. Here, we investigated the immunoregulatory potential of RORα in collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mice, an experimental model of RA. Cholesterol sulfate (CS) or SR1078, a ligand of RORα, inhibited RORγt expression and Th17 differentiation . In addition, fortification of RORα in T cells inhibited the expression levels of -associated genes. We found that RORα overexpression in CIA mice attenuated the clinical and histological severities of inflammatory arthritis. The anti-arthritic effect of RORα was associated with suppressed Th17 differentiation and attenuated mTOR-STAT3 signaling in T cells. Furthermore, altered RORα activity could directly affect osteoclastogenesis implicated in progressive bone destruction in human RA. Our findings defined a critical role of RORα in the pathogenesis of RA. These data suggest that RORα may have novel therapeutic uses in the treatment of RA.Copyright © 2019 Park, Moon, Lim, Byun, Hwang, Yang, Kim, Lee, Kim, Lee, Kwok, Min, Lee, Shin, Park and Cho.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31632331>Energy Metabolism and Redox State in Brains of Wistar Audiogenic Rats, a Genetic Model of Epilepsy.</a></h1><p>The Wistar Audiogenic Rat (WAR) strain is a genetic model of epilepsy, specifically brainstem-dependent tonic-clonic seizures, triggered by acute auditory stimulation. Chronic audiogenic seizures (audiogenic kindling) mimic temporal lobe epilepsy, with significant participation of the hippocampus, amygdala, and cortex. The objective of the present study was to characterize the mitochondrial energy metabolism in hippocampus and cortex of WAR and verify its relationship with seizure severity. Hippocampus of WAR naïve (no seizures) presented higher oxygen consumption in respiratory states related to the maximum capacities of phosphorylation and electron transfer system, elevated mitochondrial density, lower GSH/GSSG and catalase activity, and higher protein carbonyl and lactate contents, compared with their Wistar counterparts. Audiogenic kindling had no adding functional effect in WAR, but in Wistar, it induced the same alterations observed in the audiogenic strain. In the cortex, WAR naïve presented elevated mitochondrial density, lower GSH/GSSG and catalase activity, and higher protein carbonyl levels. Chronic acoustic stimulation in Wistar induced the same alterations in cortex and hippocampus. Mainly in the hippocampus, WAR naïve presented elevated mRNA expression of glucose, lactate and excitatory amino acids transporters, several glycolytic enzymes, lactate dehydrogenase, and Na/K ATPase in neurons and in astrocytes.  treatment with mitochondrial uncoupler 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP) or N-acetylcysteine (NAC) in WAR had no effect on mitochondrial metabolism, but lowered oxidative stress. Unlike DNP, NAC downregulated all enzyme genes involved in glucose and lactate uptake, and metabolism in neurons and astrocytes. Additionally, it was able to reduce brainstem seizure severity in WAR. In conclusion, in WAR naïve animals, both cerebral cortex and hippocampus display elevated mitochondrial density and/or activity associated with oxidative damage, glucose and lactate metabolism pathways upregulation, and increased Na/K ATPase mRNA expression. Only  treatment with NAC was able to reduce seizure severity of kindled WARs, possibly via down regulation of glucose/lactate metabolism. Taken together, our results are a clear contribution to the field of mitochondrial metabolism associated to epileptic seizures.Copyright © 2019 Dechandt, Ferrari, dos Santos, de Oliveira, Silva-Jr, Cunha, Garcia-Cairasco and Alberici.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31633763>A suppressive oligodeoxynucleotide expressing TTAGGG motifs modulates cellular energetics through the mTOR signaling pathway.</a></h1><p>Immune-mediated inflammation must be down-regulated to facilitate tissue remodeling during homeostatic restoration of an inflammatory response. Uncontrolled or over-exuberant immune activation can cause autoimmune diseases, as well as tissue destruction. A151, the archetypal example of a chemically synthesized suppressive oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) based on repetitive telomere-derived TTAGGG sequences, was shown to successfully down-regulate a variety of immune responses. However, the degree, duration and breadth of A151-induced transcriptome alterations remain elusive. Here, we performed a comprehensive microarray analysis in combination with Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) using murine splenocytes to investigate the underlying mechanism of A151-dependent immune suppression. Our results revealed that A151 significantly down-regulates critical mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) activators (Pi3kcd, Pdpk1 and Rheb), elements downstream of mTOR signaling (Rps6ka1, Myc, Stat3 and Slc2a1), an important component of the mTORC2 protein complex (Rictor) and Mtor itself. The effects of A151 on mTOR signaling were dose- and time-dependent. Moreover, flow cytometry and immunoblotting analyses demonstrated that A151 is able to reverse mTOR phosphorylation comparably to the well-known mTOR inhibitor rapamycin. Furthermore, Seahorse metabolic assays showed an A151 ODN-induced decrease in both oxygen consumption and  implying that a metabolically inert state in macrophages could be triggered by A151 treatment. Overall, our findings suggested novel insights into the mechanism by which the immune system is metabolically modulated by A151 ODN.© The Japanese Society for Immunology. 2019. All rights reserved.

The storage time under these conditions may have an impact on platelets and their releasate leading to potential adverse reactions following transfusion to patients. The aim of this study was to analyze the proteome of extracellular vesicles generated by platelets at different storage days (2 and 7) to gain deeper information on the platelet concentrates state at those moments. EVs were isolated by a centrifugation-based approach and characterized by dynamic light scattering and transmission electron microscopy. Proteomic analysis was by LC-MS/MS and quantification by SWATH. In this way, 151 proteins were found up-regulated at day 7 of storage. This group includes CCL5 and Platelet Factor 4, chemokines with power to attract neutrophils and monocytes, which could generate transfusion adverse reactions. In addition, other glycoproteins and platelet activation markers were also found elevated at day 7. Proteins related to  and lactate production were found altered with high fold changes, showing a deregulation of platelet metabolism at day 7. The obtained results provide novel information about possible effects of platelet-derived EVs on transfusion adverse reactions. SIGNIFICANCE: We performed the first proteomic analysis of extracellular vesicles derived from platelets upon storage at different time points on blood bank conditions after Mirasol® treatment. We identified a high number of proteins related to platelet activation and platelet storage lesion that could have a role in possible transfusion adverse reactions.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The results showed that a total of 3080/1908, 3110/2115 and 2684/1483 genes were up-/down-regulated after 6 h, 12 h and 24 h of treatment, respectively, compared with control check group (CK, 0 h). Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis showed that most of these differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were enriched in energy metabolism, carbohydrate synthesis, cell wall precursor synthesis and hormone regulation pathways. For energy metabolism, the expression of most genes involved in photosynthesis (including the light reaction and Calvin cycle) was generally inhibited, while the expression of genes related , the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and PPP pathway was up-regulated. In addition, the increase in the CO concentration induced the up-regulation of gene expression in the sucrose synthesis pathway. Among all starch synthesis genes,  (granule-bound starch synthase) had the highest expression level. On the other hand, during the synthesis of hemicellulose and pectin (cell wall precursor substances), the expression levels of  (GDP-mannose 4,6-dehydratase),  (Mannose-1-phosphate guanylyl transferase) and  (Rhamnose biosynthetic enzyme) were the highest, suggesting that the synthesis of the raw materials hemicellulose and pectin in Masson pine under stress were mainly supplied by GDP-Man, GDP-Fuc and UDP-Rha. Finally, stress inhibited gene expression in the ABA (Abscisic Acid) synthesis pathway and induced gene expression in the GA (Gibberellin), SA (Salicylic acid), BR(Brassinolide) and MeJA (Methyl Jasmonate) pathways. Stomatal switches were regulated by hormonal interactions.

Identifying the metabolic adaptations crucial for tumor progression may be a promising strategy to discover novel therapeutic targets. Here, we have combined proteomics, gene expression profiling, functional analysis, and metabolic tracing to decipher the impact of MYCN on neuroblastoma cell metabolism. We found that high MYCN levels are correlated with altered expression of proteins involved in multiple metabolic processes, including enhanced  and increased oxidative phosphorylation. Unexpectedly, we discovered that MYCN-amplified cells showed de novo glutamine synthesis. Furthermore, inhibition of β-oxidation reduced the viability of MYCN-amplified cells in vitro and decreased tumor burden in vivo, while not affecting non-MYCN-amplified tumors. Our data provide information on metabolic processes in MYCN expressing tumors, which could be exploited for the development of novel targeted therapies.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

Here we inactivate  dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) by introducing D27G,N,F chromosomal mutations in a key catalytic residue with subsequent adaptation by an automated serial transfer protocol. The partial reversal G27->C occurred in three evolutionary trajectories. Conversely, in one trajectory for D27G and in all trajectories for D27F,N strains adapted to grow at very low metabolic supplement (folAmix) concentrations but did not escape entirely from supplement auxotrophy. Major global shifts in metabolome and proteome occurred upon DHFR inactivation, which were partially reversed in adapted strains. Loss-of-function mutations in two genes,  and , ensured adaptation to low folAmix by rerouting the 2-Deoxy-D-ribose-phosphate metabolism from  towards synthesis of dTMP. Multiple evolutionary pathways of adaptation converged to a suboptimal solution due to the high accessibility to loss-of-function mutations that block the path to the highest, yet least accessible, fitness peak.© 2019, Rodrigues & Shakhnovich.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31616440>NK Cell Metabolism and Tumor Microenvironment.</a></h1><p>Natural Killer (NK) cells are characterized by their potential to kill tumor cells by different means without previous sensitization and have, therefore, become a valuable tool in cancer immunotherapy. However, their efficacy against solid tumors is still poor and further studies are required to improve it. One of the major restrictions for NK cell activity is the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). There, tumor and other immune cells create the appropriate conditions for tumor proliferation while, among others, preventing NK cell activation. Furthermore, NK cell metabolism is impaired in the TME, presumably due to nutrient and oxygen deprivation, and the higher concentration of tumor-derived metabolic end products, such as lactate. This metabolic restriction of NK cells limits their effector functions, and it could represent a potential target to focus on to improve the efficacy of NK cell-based therapies against solid tumors. In this review, we discuss the potential effect of TME into NK cell metabolism and its influence in NK cell effector functions.Copyright © 2019 Terrén, Orrantia, Vitallé, Zenarruzabeitia and Borrego.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31612140>2-Deoxyglucose and Newcastle Disease Virus Synergize to Kill Breast Cancer Cells by Inhibition of  Pathway Through Glyceraldehyde3-Phosphate Downregulation.</a></h1><p>Targeting cancer cells metabolism is promising strategy in inhibiting cancer cells progression that are known to exhibit increased aerobic . We used the glucose analog 2-Deoxyglucose (2-DG) as a competitor molecule of glucose. To further enhance the effectiveness of 2-DG, the Newcastle disease virus (NDV) was used as a combination virotherapy to enhance the anti-tumor effect. Human and mouse-breast cancer cells were treated by NDV and/or 2-DG. The effect was analyzed by study cell viability, apoptosis and level of glyceraldehyde3-phosphate (GAPDH) by ELISA and QPCR assays. Synergistic cytotoxicity was found after a 72-h treatment of human- and mouse-breast cancer cells with 2-DG in combination with NDV at different concentrations. The synergistic cytotoxicity was accompanied by apoptotic cell death and GAPDH downregulation and inhibition to  product pyruvate. The combination treatment showed significant tumor growth inhibition compared to single treatments .

Such responses play an essential role in eliminating viral infections and can be anti-tumorigenic. However, the underlying mechanisms of how TLR7 can promote the optimal function of CD8+ T cells remain unclear. To investigate how TLR signaling directly contributes to CD8+ T cell functions, we examine the activation of cellular TLR7-related pathways and functional and metabolic alterations in TLR7-stimulated T cells during T cell receptor (TCR) signaling. In the present study, we investigated the activation of CD8+ T cells in response to direct stimulation by TLR7 ligands. TLR7 stimulation could promote the effector functions of purified CD8+ T cells .

Since this CN-insensitive respiration pathway reoxidizes NADH without ATP production, it contributes to continuous  in A. niger. In this study, to show the availability of aoxA gene encoding AOX as a tool for metabolic engineering, we generated efficient oxalic acid (OA)-producers by genetic engineering of A. niger using aoxA gene. The OA-producing strain EOAH-1, generated by overexpression of the oxaloacetate hydrolase (EC 3.7.1.1; OAH) gene oahA in A. niger WU-2223L, produced 28 g/L OA from 30 g/L glucose during the 9-day cultivation period. Moreover, the strain EAOXOAH-1, generated by overexpression of both aoxA and oahA genes in strain WU-2223L, produced 28 g/L OA during the 7-day cultivation period. Strain EAOXOAH-1 showed higher glucose consumption rate than EOAH-1 did, indicating that overexpression of aoxA contributed to the acceleration of glucose consumption, and that the OA production period was shortened by 2 days. Thus, we clearly show that AOX gene must be an effective tool in metabolic engineering for efficient organic acids production from carbohydrates.Copyright © 2019 The Society for Biotechnology, Japan.

In this study, female SD rats were orally treated with 0, 15, or 30 mg/kg·bw AA for 3 weeks. The levels of fasting blood glucose (FBG), blood glucose after oral administration of glucose, plasma insulin and hepatic glycogen were measured. The histology of the pancreas was observed, and the transcription of key genes involved in glucose metabolism and insulin signaling in liver were determined. Compared with the control, exposure to 30 mg/kg·bw of AA significantly increased FBG level, reduced hepatic glycogen content and impaired glucose tolerance. Moreover, damaged islets were observed at 15 and 30 mg/kg·bw AA-exposed groups. In addition, AA exposure significantly promoted gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis (up-regulation of pc, g6p and gp) and decreased  (down-regulation of gck and pfk). Alternations in these processes may be associated with decreased plasma insulin levels and inhibited insulin-regulated IRS/PI3K/Akt/Foxo1 signaling transduction under AA exposure.

We previously showed Rev-erbα reduction in human gastric cancer, which is associated with TMN stages and poor prognosis. We hypothesized that Rev-erbα modulates proliferation via glycolytic flux and the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) in gastric cancer. Knockdown of Rev-erbα significantly increased proliferation as well as glycolytic flux and the PPP in human gastric cancer cells.

In the context of regenerative medicine, innovative parameters predictive of therapeutic efficacy could be drawn from the association of metabolic or mitochondrial parameters to different degrees of stemness and differentiation potentials. Herein, this possibility was addressed in human mesenchymal stromal/stem cells (hMSC) previously shown to differ in lifespan and telomere length. First, these hMSC were shown to possess significantly distinct proliferation rate, senescence status and differentiation capacity. More potential hMSC were associated to higher mitochondrial (mt) DNA copy number and lower mtDNA methylation. In addition, they showed higher expression levels of oxidative phosphorylation subunits. Consistently, they exhibited higher coupled oxygen consumption rate and lower transcription of -related genes, glucose consumption and lactate production. All these data pointed at oxidative phosphorylation-based central metabolism as a feature of higher stemness-associated hMSC phenotypes. Consistently, reduction of mitochondrial activity by complex I and III inhibitors in higher stemness-associated hMSC triggered senescence. Finally, functionally higher stemness-associated hMSC showed metabolic plasticity when challenged by glucose or glutamine shortage, which mimic bioenergetics switches that hMSC must undergo after transplantation or during self-renewal and differentiation.

Based on the characteristics of each pathway during energy metabolism,in the present study,the triple negative breast cancer tumor cells( MDA-MB-231) were selected to investigate the effects of glabridin and quercetin on the energy metabolism of breast cancer cells and discuss the possible mechanisms from the following five potential targets: glucose uptake,protein expression of glucose transporter 1( GLUT1),adenosine triphosphate( ATP) level,lactate dehydrogenase( LDH) activity,and lactic acid( LD) concentration.

Very recently, elevated  is demonstrated to play a pivotal role in the determination of fibrogenic phenotype of fibroblasts. However, it is lack of specific strategies for targeting and elimination of such fibrogenic populations. In this study, a novel strategy to use the a near-infrared (NIR) dye IR-780 for the targeting and elimination of a fibrogenic population of glycolytic fibroblasts to control the cutaneous scarring is developed.  The identification and cell properties test of fibrogenic fibroblasts with IR-780 were conducted by using fluorescence activated cell sorting, transplantation experiments,  imaging, RNA sequencing in human cell experiments and mouse and rat wound models. The uptake of IR-780 in fibroblasts mediated by HIF-1α/SLCO2A1 and the metabolic properties of IR-780 fibroblasts were investigated using RNA interference or signaling inhibitors. The fibrogenic fibroblast-selective near-infrared phototherapy of IR-780 were evaluated in human cell experiments and mouse wound models.  IR-780 is demonstrated to recognize a unique glycolytic fibroblast lineage, which is responsible for the bulk of connective tissue deposition during cutaneous wound healing and cancer stroma formation. Further results identified that SLCO2A1 is involved in the preferential uptake of IR-780 in fibrogenic fibroblasts, which is regulated by HIF-1α. Moreover, with intrinsic dual phototherapeutic activities, IR-780 significantly diminishes cutaneous scarring through the targeted ablation of the fibrogenic population by photothermal and photodynamic effects.  This work provides a unique strategy for the targeted control of tissue scarring by fibrogenic fibroblast-selective near-infrared phototherapy. It is proposed that IR-780 based theranostic methodology holds promise for translational medicine aimed at regulation of fibrogenic behavior.© The author(s).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31600945>Metabolomic Profiling of the Immune Stimulatory Effect of Eicosenoids on PMA-Differentiated THP-1 Cells.</a></h1><p>Honey bee venom has been established to have significant effect in immunotherapy. In the present study, (Z)-11-eicosenol-a major constituent of bee venom, along with its derivations methyl cis-11-eicosenoate and cis-11-eicosenoic acid, were synthesised to investigate their immune stimulatory effect and possible use as vaccine adjuvants. Stimuli that prime and activate the immune system have exerted profound effects on immune cells, particularly macrophages; however, the effectiveness of bee venom constituents as immune stimulants has not yet been established.

The LPS-stimulated production of most of the inflammatory metabolite biomarkers in , the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, the pentose phosphate pathway, purine, pyrimidine and fatty acids metabolism were significantly enhanced by all three compounds, and particularly by methyl cis-11-eicosenoate and cis-11-eicosenoic acid. These findings support the proposed actions of (Z)-11-eicosenol, methyl cis-11-eicosenoate and cis-11-eicosenoic acid as immune system stimulators.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663776>Site-specific chemoproteomic profiling of targets of glyoxal.</a></h1><p> Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) are the biomarkers of aging and diabetes which are formed via reactions between glycating agents and biomacromolecules. However, no proteomic study has been reported to systematically investigate the protein substrates of AGEs.  In this paper, we used an aniline-based probe to capture the glyoxal-imine intermediate which is the transition sate of glyoxal-derived AGEs. Combined with the tandem orthogonal proteolysis activity-based protein profiling strategy, we successfully identified 962 lysines modified by glyoxal.  Enzymes in  are heavily modified by glyoxal and our biochemical experiments showed that glyoxal can significantly inhibit the activity of GAPDH and .

Although long-term survival of HB is generally favorable, it depends on clinical stage, tumor histology, and a variety of biochemical and molecular features. HB appears almost exclusively before the age of three years, is represented by seven histological subtypes, and is usually associated with highly heterogeneous somatic mutations in the catenin β 1 (CTNNB1) gene, which encodes β-catenin, a Wnt ligand-responsive transcriptional co-factor. Numerous recurring β-catenin mutations, not previously documented in HB, have also been identified in various other pediatric and adult cancer types. Little is known about the underlying factors that determine the above HB features and behaviors or whether non-HB-associated β-catenin mutations are tumorigenic when expressed in hepatocytes. Here, we investigated the oncogenic properties of 14 different HB- and non-HB-associated β-catenin mutants encoded by Sleeping Beauty vectors following their delivery into the mouse liver by hydrodynamic tail-vein injection. We show that all β-catenin mutations, as well as wild-type β-catenin, are tumorigenic when co-expressed with a mutant form of yes-associated protein (YAP). However, tumor growth rates, histologies, nuclear-to-cytoplasmic partitioning, and metabolic and transcriptional landscapes were strongly influenced by the identities of the β-catenin mutations. These findings provide a context for understanding at the molecular level the notable biological diversity of HB.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31585510>Elimination of human folypolyglutamate synthetase alters programming and plasticity of somatic cells.</a></h1><p>Folates are vital cofactors for the regeneration of -adenosyl methionine, which is the methyl source for DNA methylation, protein methylation, and other aspects of one-carbon (C1) metabolism. Thus, folates are critical for establishing and preserving epigenetic programming. Folypolyglutamate synthetase (FPGS) is known to play a crucial role in the maintenance of intracellular folate levels. Therefore, any modulation in FPGS is expected to alter DNA methylation and numerous other metabolic pathways. To explore the role of polyglutamylation of folate, we eliminated both isoforms of FPGS in human cells (293T), producing FPGS knockout (FPGS) cells. The elimination of FPGS significantly decreased cell proliferation, with a major effect on oxidative phosphorylation and a lesser effect on . We found a substantial reduction in global DNA methylation and noteworthy changes in gene expression related to C1 metabolism, cell division, DNA methylation, pluripotency, Glu metabolism, neurogenesis, and cardiogenesis. The expression levels of , octamer-binding transcription factor 4, and sex-determining region Y-box 2 levels were increased in the mutant, consistent with the transition to a stem cell-like state. Gene expression and metabolite data also indicate a major change in Glu and GABA metabolism. In the appropriate medium, FPGS cells can differentiate to produce mainly cells with characteristics of either neural stem cells or cardiomyocytes.-Srivastava, A. C., Thompson, Y.

Thepatients' age, maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax), SUVmean, metabolic tumor volume (MTV) and the totallesion  (TLG) value of the primary tumor on PET/CT; as well as the stage, histological subtype, grade and size ofthe primary EC; the degree of myometrial invasion (MI) cervical invasion (CI), lymphovascular invasion (LVI), lymph nodemetastasis (LNM) and distant metastasis (DM) were all recorded. The relationship of these factors with progression-freesurvival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) was evaluated.The study included 120 patients with EC with a mean age of 62.3 ± 0.02 years. Of the total, 32 patients diedaround the time of the analysis and 38 patients showed disease progression. The mean OS was 32.7 ± 1.6 months and themean PFS was 30.5 ± 2.8 months. No significant relationship was identified between the SUVmax, SUVmean, MTV, TLGvalues, patient age, tumor size, histology, grade and MI degree, and OS or PFS.

MΦs display a spectrum of functional phenotypes as a result of microenvironmental and stress-induced stimuli. Evidence has emerged demonstrating that metabolism is not only crucial for the generation of energy and biomolecular precursors, but also contributes to the function and plasticity of MΦs. Here, 1D H NMR-based metabolomics was employed to identify metabolic pathways that are differentially modulated following primary human monocyte-derived MΦ activation with pro-inflammatory (M1) or anti-inflammatory (M2a) stimuli relative to resting (M0) MΦs. The metabolic profiling of M1 MΦs indicated a substantial increase in oxidative stress as well as a decrease in mitochondrial respiration. These metabolic profiles also provide compelling evidence that M1 MΦs divert metabolites from  glycerophospholipid synthesis to inhibit oxidative phosphorylation. Furthermore,  and lactic acid fermentation were significantly increased in both M1 and M2a MΦs. These metabolic patterns highlight robust metabolic activation markers of MΦ phenotypes. Overall, our study generates additional support to previous observations, presents novel findings regarding the metabolic modulation of human MΦs following activation, and contributes new knowledge to the rapidly evolving field of immunometabolism.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31667854>Metabolomics analysis in adults with High Bone Mass identifies a relationship between bone resorption and circulating citrate which replicates in the general population.</a></h1><p>Bone turnover, which regulates bone mass, may exert metabolic consequences, particularly on markers of glucose metabolism and adiposity. To better understand these relationships, we examined cross-sectional associations between bone turnover markers (BTMs) and metabolic traits in a population with high bone mass (HBM, BMD Z-score≥+3.2).β-C-terminal telopeptide of type-I collagen (β-CTX), procollagen type-1 amino-terminal propeptide (P1NP) and osteocalcin were assessed by electrochemiluminescence immunoassays. Metabolic traits, including lipids and -related metabolites, were measured using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy. Associations of BTMs with metabolic traits were assessed using Generalized Estimating Equation linear regression, accounting for within-family correlation, adjusting for potential confounders (age, sex, height, weight, menopause, bisphosphonate and oral glucocorticoid use).198 adults with HBM had complete data, mean [SD] age 61.6 [13.7] years; 77% female. Of 23 summary metabolic traits, citrate was positively related to all BTMs: adjusted β =0.050 (95% CI 0.024,0.076),p=1.71x10 , β =6.54x10 (1.87x10 ,0.001),p=0.006 and β =2.40x10 (6.49x10 ,4.14x10 ),p=0.007 (β= increase in citrate (mmol/L) per 1μg/L BTM increase). Inverse relationships of β-CTX (β=-0.276 [-0.434,-0.118],p=6.03x10 ) and osteocalcin (-0.004 [-0.007,-0.001],p=0.020) with triglycerides were also identified. We explored the generalizability of these associations in 3,664 perimenopausal women (age 47.9 [4.4] years) from a UK family cohort. We confirmed a positive, albeit lower magnitude, association between β-CTX and citrate (adjusted β =0.020 [0.013,0.026],p=1.95x10 ) and an inverse association of similar magnitude between β-CTX and triglycerides (β=-0.354 [-0.471,-0.237],p=3.03x10 ).Bone resorption is positively related to circulating citrate and inversely related to triglycerides. Further studies are justified to determine whether plasma citrate or triglyceride concentrations are altered by factors known to modulate bone resorption, such as bisphosphonates.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31585100>Fifty Shades of α-Ketoglutarate on Cellular Programming.</a></h1><p>High plasticity to utilize different nutrients to adapt metabolic stress is one of the hallmarks for cancer cells.

Despite extensive research in animal models and numerous promising treatment trials, there is still no curative treatment for AD. Astrocytes, the most common cell type of the central nervous system, have been shown to play a role in the major AD pathologies, including accumulation of amyloid plaques, neuroinflammation, and oxidative stress. Here, we show that inflammatory stimulation leads to metabolic activation of human astrocytes and reduces amyloid secretion. On the other hand, the activation of oxidative metabolism leads to increased reactive oxygen species production especially in AD astrocytes. While healthy astrocytes increase glutathione (GSH) release to protect the cells, Presenilin-1-mutated AD patient astrocytes do not. Thus, chronic inflammation is likely to induce oxidative damage in AD astrocytes. Activation of NRF2, the major regulator of cellular antioxidant defenses, encoded by the NFE2L2 gene, poses several beneficial effects on AD astrocytes. We report here that the activation of NRF2 pathway reduces amyloid secretion, normalizes cytokine release, and increases GSH secretion in AD astrocytes. NRF2 induction also activates the metabolism of astrocytes and increases the utilization of . Taken together, targeting NRF2 in astrocytes could be a potent therapeutic strategy in AD.© 2019 The Authors.

Because CD8 T cells are essential for eliminating infectious agents, it is crucial to understand why they behave differently in early life. Previous studies in mice have demonstrated that neonatal CD8 T cells fail to form memory because of an intrinsic propensity to differentiate into short-lived effectors. However, the underlying mechanisms remain undefined. We now show that neonatal CD8 T cells exhibit higher glycolytic activity than adult CD8 T cells postinfection, which may be due to age-related differences in Lin28b expression. Importantly, when  is pharmacologically inhibited, the impaired formation of neonatal memory CD8 T cells can be restored. Collectively, these data suggest that neonatal CD8 T cells are inherently biased toward undergoing glycolytic metabolism postinfection, which compromises their ability to develop into memory CD8 T cells in early life.Copyright © 2019 by The American Association of Immunologists, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661772>Immunomodulatory Protein from  Induces Apoptosis in Lung Cancer Cells via the P53 Pathway.</a></h1><p>Our previous research has shown that a fungal immunomodulatory protein from  (FIP-nha) possesses a wide spectrum of anti-tumor activities, and FIP-nha induced A549 apoptosis by negatively regulating the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway based on comparative quantitative proteomics. This study further confirmed that the anti-lung cancer activity of FIP-nha was significantly stronger than that of the reported LZ-8 and FIP-fve. Subsequently, H NMR-based metabolomics was applied to comprehensively investigate the underlying mechanism, and a clear separation of FIP-nha-treated and untreated groups was achieved using pattern recognition analysis. Four potential pathways associated with the anti-tumor effect of FIP-nha on A549 cells were identified, and these were mainly involved in , taurine and hypotaurine metabolism, fructose and mannose metabolism, and glycerolipid metabolism. Metabolic pathway analysis demonstrated that FIP-nha could induce A549 cell apoptosis partly by regulating the p53 inhibition pathway, which then disrupted the Warburg effect, as well as through other metabolic pathways. Using RT-PCR analysis, FIP-nha-induced apoptosis was confirmed to occur through upregulation of p53 expression.

The involved molecular mechanisms were investigated for the first time using transcriptome and metabolome in this study. Results showed that subinhibitory concentration of PT (0.5 mg/ml) induced significant changes in MRSA at both transcriptional and metabolic levels, as 370 genes and 19 metabolites were differentially expressed. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that the varying genes and metabolites were mainly involved in pathways of membrane transport, amino acids, carbohydrate, and energy metabolism. The highlighted changes were those related to osmotic regulation, intracellular pH regulation, amino acid synthesis and metabolism, , TCA cycle and iron metabolism, suggesting the multifaceted effects including cell membrane damage, amino acids limitation, energy metabolism disorder and iron deprivation induced by PT. The results provided insight into the anti-MRSA mechanism of PT, which is useful for PT's development and application in food safety.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

It is not known whether ATP synthase and ATPase function are correlated with different spatio-temporal organization of the enzyme. To analyze this, we have tracked and localized individual ATP synthase/ATPase molecules in situ by live cell microscopy. Under normal conditions, ATP synthase is restricted mainly to cristae. A mobile fraction exist that displays orthogonal trajectories following the cristae membranes but also move in the IBM. By inhibiting , we induced ATP hydrolysis in addition to ATP synthesis. The coexistence of two subpopulations was supported by data from single molecule localization and tracking analysis. We found that the spatial-temporal organization of ATP synthase was flexible and mirrored the physiological data. The clear cristae-related structuring of the ATP synthase/ATPase was obliterated when  was inhibited. At the same time, ATP synthase dimers decreased. The ratiometric change in dimeric/monomeric, respectively more mobile/less mobile ATP synthase was reversible. In IF1-KO cells, ATP synthase was more mobile, while inhibition of ATPase activity decreased the mobility. Together this data strongly supports the model of distinct subpopulations of ATP synthase and ATP hydrolase, the latter with higher mobility and likely present in the IBM compartment. Obviously, ATP synthase reacts quickly and reversibly to metabolic conditions, not only through functional but also through spatial and structural re-organization.Copyright © 2019.

Seed starch content is a typical quantitative phenotype and many reports revealed that the glycolytic enzymes are involved in regulating starch synthesis, however the regulatory mechanism is still unclear.

Dynamics of 17 enzymes related to  and starch synthesis were used to construct a phosphorylation regulatory network of starch synthesis. It shows that starch synthesis and  in maize seeds utilize the same hexose phosphates pool coming from sorbitol and sucrose as carbon source, and phosphorylation of ZmENO1 are suggested to contribute to increase starch content, because it is positively related to seed starch content in different developmental stages and different lines, and the phosphor-mimic mutant (ZmENO1) damaged its enzyme activity which is vital in .

The current study aimed to determine the optimal conditions for efficient T cell amplification by two commonly used methods involving CD3/CD28 antibody and phytohemagglutinin (PHA), respectively.Orthogonal design and CCK8 assay showed that 5 μg/mL CD3, 5 μg/mL CD28, and 100 ng/mL IL2 for the first method and 50 μg/mL PHA for the second method was optimal for T cell stimulation. Flow cytometry demonstrated that the percentage of CD8 in the stimulated groups significantly increased, while the percentage of CD4/CD8 was significantly decreased compared with the unstimulated group. The percentage of CD4 showed no significant difference among the three groups. Notably, there was no significant difference between the two stimulated groups. In addition, the percentage of apoptotic cells was significantly increased in the stimulated groups compared with the unstimulated group, but showed no remarkable difference between the PHA and CD3/CD28 stimulation groups.  analysis showed that the glycolytic capacity and glycolytic reserve were both significantly increased in the PHA and CD3/CD28 groups compared with the unstimulated group, with no significant difference noted between the stimulated groups.Although both stimulation methods showed similar efficacies, we suggest the PHA method might be better considering its easy application and cost-effective nature.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31636238>TLR2 Stimulation Increases Cellular Metabolism in CD8 T Cells and Thereby Enhances CD8 T Cell Activation, Function, and Antiviral Activity.</a></h1><p>TLR2 serves as a costimulatory molecule on activated T cells. However, it is unknown how the functionality and antiviral activity of CD8 T cells are modulated by direct TLR2 signaling. In this study, we looked at the TLR2-mediated enhancement of TCR-driven CD8 T cell activation in vitro and in woodchuck hepatitis virus transgenic mice. In vitro stimulation of CD8 T cells purified from C57BL/6 mice showed that TLR2 agonist Pam3CSK4 directly enhanced the TCR-dependent CD8 T cell activation. Transcriptome analysis revealed that TLR2 signaling increased expression of bioenergy metabolism-related genes in CD8 T cells, such as IRF4, leading to improved  and glutaminolysis. This was associated with the upregulation of genes related to immune regulation and functions such as T-bet and IFN-γ.  and glutaminolysis were in turn essential for the TLR2-mediated enhancement of T cell activation.

The aim of this study was to investigate the absorbed dose-response relationship and its association with overall survival for Ho-radioembolization in patients with liver metastases.  Patients who were treated in the HEPAR I and II studies and who underwent an FDG-PET/CT scan at baseline, a post-treatment Ho-SPECT/CT scan and another FDG-PET/CT scan at three months follow-up, were included for analysis. The post-treatment Ho-microspheres activity distributions were estimated with quantitative SPECT/CT reconstructions using a quantitative Monte Carlo-based reconstructor. Response of each individual tumor was based on the change in total lesion  (TLG) between baseline and follow-up and categorized in one of four categories, according to the PERCIST criteria, ranging from complete response to progressive disease. Patient level response was grouped according to the average change in TLG per patient. The absorbed dose-response relationship was assessed using a linear mixed-model to account for correlation of tumors within patients. Median overall survival was compared between patients with and without a metabolic liver response, using a log-rank test.  In total 36 patients with a total of 98 tumors were included. The relation between tumor absorbed dose and both tumor level and patient level response was explored. At a tumor level, a significant difference in geometric mean absorbed dose was found between response categories complete response (232 Gy (95%-confidence interval (CI) 178-303 Gy);  = 32) and stable disease (147 Gy (95% CI 113-191 Gy);  = 28),  = 0.01. and between complete response and progressive disease (117 Gy (95% CI 87-159 Gy);  = 21),  = 0.0008). This constitutes a robust absorbed dose-response relationship. At a patient level, a significant difference was found between patients with complete or partial response (210 Gy (95% CI: 161-274 Gy);  = 13) and patients with progressive disease (116 Gy (95% CI: 81-165 Gy);  = 9),  = 0.01. Patients were subsequently grouped according to their average change in TLG. Patients with objective response (complete or partial response) exhibited a significantly higher overall survival than non-responding patients (stable or progressive disease) (median 19 months versus 7.5 months; Log-rank;  = 0.01).  These results confirm a significant absorbed dose-response relationship in Ho-radioembolization.

In addition to blocking EGFR-stimulated cell signaling, cetuximab can induce endocytosis of ASCT2, a glutamine transporter associated with EGFR in a complex, leading to glutathione biosynthesis inhibition and cellular sensitization to ROS. Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-1 (PDK1), a key mitochondrial enzyme overexpressed in cancer cells, redirects glucose metabolism from oxidative phosphorylation toward aerobic . In this study, we tested the hypothesis that targeting PDK1 is a rational approach to synergize with cetuximab through ROS overproduction. We found that combination of PDK1 knockdown or inhibition by dichloroacetic acid (DCA) with ASCT2 knockdown or with cetuximab treatment induced ROS overproduction and apoptosis in HNSCC cells, and this effect was independent of effective inhibition of EGFR downstream pathways but could be lessened by N-acetyl cysteine, an anti-oxidative agent. In several cetuximab-resistant HNSCC xenograft models, DCA plus cetuximab induced marked tumor regression, whereas either agent alone failed to induce tumor regression.

Recent studies indicated that endocrine disruptor chemicals (EDCs) are potential risk factors for AML progression. Our present data showed that an industrial endocrine disrupting chemical, Benzyl butyl phthalate (BBP), can promote the proliferation of AML cells and decrease their sensitivity to daunorubicin (DNR) and cytarabine (Ara-C) treatments. Further, BBP can increase the glucose consumption, lactate generation, and ATP levels of AML cells. Among the measured -related genes, BBP can increase the expression of pyruvate dehydrogenase lipoamide kinase isozyme 4 (PDK4), a mitochondrial protein that regulates the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) cycle. The inhibitor of PDK4 or its specific siRNA can attenuate BBP-induced cell proliferation and ATP generation, which suggested the essential roles of PDK4 in BBP-induced  and proliferation. Further, BBP can increase the mRNA stability of PDK4, while had no effect on its transcription and protein stability. miR-15b-5p can bind with the 3'UTR of PDK4 to decrease its mRNA stability, while BBP can decrease the expression of miR-15b-5p in AML cells. Collectively, our data showed that BBP can trigger the malignancy of AML cells via regulation of miR-15b-5p/PDK4 signals.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Survival analysis showed that patients with TLG ≤ 54.7 g had a significantly prolonged progression-free survival as compared to patients with TLG > 54.7 g (p < 0.0001). Moreover, overall survival was significantly better in patients showing a MTV ≤ 9.5 ml as compared to those having MTV > 9.5 ml (p < 0.0001). Similar results were obtained in a subgroup of 43 patients with advanced disease (stages III and IV).Whole-body PET-based volumetric imaging parameters are able to predict outcome in NSCLC patients.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31585088>Integrated Proteogenomic Characterization of HBV-Related Hepatocellular Carcinoma.</a></h1><p>We performed the first proteogenomic characterization of hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) using paired tumor and adjacent liver tissues from 159 patients. Integrated proteogenomic analyses revealed consistency and discordance among multi-omics, activation status of key signaling pathways, and liver-specific metabolic reprogramming in HBV-related HCC. Proteomic profiling identified three subgroups associated with clinical and molecular attributes including patient survival, tumor thrombus, genetic profile, and the liver-specific proteome. These proteomic subgroups have distinct features in metabolic reprogramming, microenvironment dysregulation, cell proliferation, and potential therapeutics. Two prognostic biomarkers, PYCR2 and ADH1A, related to proteomic subgrouping and involved in HCC metabolic reprogramming, were identified. CTNNB1 and TP53 mutation-associated signaling and metabolic profiles were revealed, among which mutated CTNNB1-associated ALDOA phosphorylation was validated to promote  and cell proliferation. Our study provides a valuable resource that significantly expands the knowledge of HBV-related HCC and may eventually benefit clinical practice.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

In this study, we found PKM2 is highly expressed in melanoma patients and the malignance is positively corelated with high PKM2 activity and glycolytic capability in melanoma cells. Suppression of PKM2 expression by knocking down markedly attenuated malignant phenotype both in vitro and in vivo, and restoration of PKM2 expression in PKM2 depleted cells could rescue melanoma cells proliferation, invasion and metastasis. With the data indicating PKM2 as a potential therapeutic target, we performed screening for PKM2 inhibitors and identified benserazide (Ben), a drug currently in clinical use. We demonstrated that Ben directly binds to and blocks PKM2 enzyme activity, leading to inhibition of aerobic  concurrent up-regulation of OXPHOS. Of note, despite PKM2 is very similar to PKM1, Ben does not affect PKM1 enzyme activity. We showed that Ben significantly inhibits cell proliferation, colony formation, invasion and migration in vitro and in vivo. The specificity of Ben was demonstrated by the findings that, suppression of PKM2 expression diminishes the efficacy of Ben in inhibtion of melanoma cell growth; ectopic PKM2 expression in normal cells sensitizes cells to Ben treatment. Interestingly, PKM2 activity and aerobic  are up-regulated in BRAFi-resistant melanoma cells. As a result, BRAFi-resistant cells exhibit a heightened sensitivity to suppression of PKM2 expression or treatment with Ben both in vitro and in vivo. This article is protected by copyright.

Microbial production of 2PE by phenylalanine bioconversion or de novo biosynthesis from sugar offer sustainable, reliable and natural production processes compared to chemical synthesis. Despite the ability of Saccharomyces cerevisiae to naturally synthesize 2PE, de novo synthesis in high concentration and yield remains a metabolic engineering challenge. Here, we demonstrate that improving phosphoenolpyruvate supply by expressing pyruvate kinase variants and eliminating the formation of p-hydroxy-phenylethanol without creating tyrosine auxotrophy significantly contributed to improve 2PE production in S. cerevisiae. In combination with the engineering of the aromatic amino acid biosynthesis and Ehrlich pathway, these mutations enabled better connection between  and pentose phosphate pathway optimizing carbon flux towards 2PE. However, attempts to further connect these two parts of central carbon metabolism by redirecting fructose-6P towards erythrose-4P by expressing a phosphoketolase-phosphotransacetylase pathway did not result in improved performance. The best performing strains were capable of producing 13mM of 2PE at a yield of 0.113 mol mol, which represents the highest yield for de novo produced 2PE in S. cerevisiae and other yeast species.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

T cells have distinct energetic and anabolic needs when nascently activated, actively proliferating, in naïveté, or in a resting, memory state. As a consequence, bioenergetics are key for T cells to mount adequate immune responses in health and disease. Solid tumors are particularly hostile metabolic environments, characterized by low glucose concentration, hypoxia, and low pH. These metabolic conditions in the tumor are known to hinder antitumor immune responses of T cells by limiting nutrient availability and energetic efficiency. In such immunosuppressive environments, artificial modulation of , mitochondrial respiratory capabilities, and fatty acid β-oxidation are known to enhance antitumor performance. Reportedly, costimulatory molecules, such as CD28 and CD137, are important regulators of metabolic routes in T cells. In this sense, different costimulatory signals and cytokines induce diverse metabolic changes that critically involve mitochondrial mass and function. For instance, the efficacy of chimeric antigen receptors (CAR) encompassing costimulatory domains, agonist antibodies to costimulatory receptors, and checkpoint inhibitors depends on the associated metabolic events in immune cells. Here, we review the metabolic changes that costimulatory receptors can promote in T cells and the potential consequences for cancer immunotherapy. Our focus is mostly on discoveries regarding the physiology and pharmacology of IL15, CD28, PD-1, and CD137 (4-1BB).©2019 American Association for Cancer Research.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31653659>A uniparental isodisomy event introducing homozygous pathogenic variants drives a multisystem metabolic disorder.</a></h1><p>Uniparental isodisomy (UPiD) is a rare genetic event that occurs when two identical copies of a single chromosome are inherited from one parent. Here we report a patient with a severe, multisystem metabolic disorder who inherited two copies of chromosome 12 from her father. He was a heterozygous carrier of a variant in the muscle-specific enzyme 6-phosphofructokinase (PFKM) gene, and of a truncating variant in the pseudouridine synthase 1 (PUS1) gene (both on chromosome 12), resulting in a homozygous state of these mutations in his daughter. The PFKM gene functions in  and is linked to Tarui syndrome. The PUS1 gene functions in mitochondrial tRNA processing and is linked to myopathy, lactic acidosis, and sideroblastic anemia (MLASA). Analysis of human dermal fibroblasts, which do not express PFKM, revealed a loss of PUS1 mRNA and PUS1 protein only in the patient cells compared to healthy controls. The patient cells also revealed a reduction of the mitochondrial-encoded protein MTCO1 while levels of the nuclear-encoded SDHA remained unchanged, suggesting a specific impairment of mitochondrial translation. Further destabilization of these cells is suggested by the altered levels of BAX, BCL-2, and TP53 proteins, alterations that become augmented upon exposure of the cells to DNA damage. The results illustrate the efficacy of UPiD events to reveal rare pathogenic variants in human disease, and demonstrate how these events can lead to cellular destabilization.Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31626563>18F-FDG PET/CT in Pulmonary Sarcoidosis:Quantifying Inflammation by the TLG index.</a></h1><p>: In sarcoidosis progressive pulmonary disease affects prognosis. Pulmonary disease activity estimated by classic means poorly predicts severity and progressiveness. F-fluoro-2-deoxyglucose-positron-emission-tomography computed-tomography (F-FDG-PET/CT) estimates pulmonary activity by inflammatory-cells metabolism. We aimed to investigate pulmonary sarcoidosis by F-FDG-PET/CT and evaluate the role of total-lesion- (TLG) value, as an index quantifying the whole burden of lung inflammation. : This is a retrospective study of sequentially gathered data. From a Greek cohort of 195 sarcoidosis-patients, 87 were identified with lung increased F-FDG uptake and further studied. : Visualizing lung by F-FDG-PET/CT identified new imaging patterns and revealed activity in all Scadding stages. Ever-smokers presented significantly higher TLG and lower DLCO compared to never-smokers. However, TLG value did not correlate with functional indices and did not differ between symptomatic and non-symptomatic patients. Among treatment-naïve patients, TLG did not differ significantly in those requiring therapy compared to those remained off. : F-FDG PET/CT improved imaging and detection of pulmonary involvement and through TLG value revealed the deleterious smoking effect. The fact that TLG neither detected patients with clinical symptoms and functional impairment nor identified those requiring treatment once again confirms that in pulmonary sarcoidosis the link between activity, severity and decision to treat still eludes us.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672495>Relationships between hypoxia induced factor-1α and F-FDG PET/CT parameters in colorectal cancer.</a></h1><p>The hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) has a critical role in oxygen homeostasis and it is a transcriptional activator of angiogenesis, erythropoiesis, iron and glucose metabolism. Glucose metabolism rate is increased in some tumours via HIF-1α. Our aim is to evaluate the relationship between hypoxia in colorectal cancer, PET parameters, necrotic tissue size and pathologic prognostic factors via using HIF-1α.70 patients (28 female/42 male; median age: 63 years) who were diagnosed with colorectal cancer via biopsy were staged with preoperative PET/CT and operated subsequently. Immunohistochemical evaluation scoring was done according to nuclear HIF-1α expression, staining density and intensity. Metabolic tumour volume (MTV), total lesion  (TLG) and tumour volume (TV) were calculated by using volume of an ellipsoid formula via CT images, and percentage of tumour necrosis (%TmNcr) that was calculated by the difference between TV and recorded MTV.There was a moderately meaningful positive correlation between tumour SUVmax and TV and %TmNcr (r=0.403, p=0.001 and r=0.500, p=0.0001, respectively). There were no statistically significant relationships between HIF-1α expression levels and tumour SUVmax, TLG, MTV, TV, %TmNcr, tumour stage, lymphovascular invasion, perineural invasion and extracapsular/capsular lymph node involvement. On the other hand, strong nuclear immunohistochemical staining was seen in tumour cells adjacent to invasive border, inflammatory cells. Although not statistically significant, moderate or strong nuclear staining were seen in 64.9% of metastatic patients.Although the presence of a positive correlation between tumour SUVmax and %TmNcr shows that there are hypoxic cells in cancer tissue with high FDG uptake, the relationship between the presence of HIF-1α and enhanced glucose metabolism and pathological prognostic factors of tumour was not shown. Strong nuclear immunohistochemical staining in tumour cells adjacent to invasive border and inflammatory cells leads us to believe that HIF-1α plays a role in the invasion area of tumour microenvironment.Copyright © 2019.

While studies of animals that became extinct can be informative, it is the survivors that provide clues for mechanisms of adaptation when conditions are adverse. Here, we describe a survival pathway used by many species as a means for providing adequate fuel and water, while also providing protection from a decrease in oxygen availability. Fructose, whether supplied in the diet (primarily fruits and honey), or endogenously (via activation of the polyol pathway), preferentially shifts the organism towards the storing of fuel (fat, glycogen) that can be used to provide energy and water at a later date. Fructose causes sodium retention and raises blood pressure and likely helped survival in the setting of dehydration or salt deprivation. By shifting energy production from the mitochondria to , fructose reduced oxygen demands to aid survival in situations where oxygen availability is low. The actions of fructose are driven in part by vasopressin and the generation of uric acid. Twice in history, mutations occurred during periods of mass extinction that enhanced the activity of fructose to generate fat, with the first being a mutation in vitamin C metabolism during the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction (65 million years ago) and the second being a mutation in uricase that occurred during the Middle Miocene disruption (12-14 million years ago). Today, the excessive intake of fructose due to the availability of refined sugar and high-fructose corn syrup is driving 'burden of life style' diseases, including obesity, diabetes and high blood pressure.© 2019 The Association for the Publication of the Journal of Internal Medicine.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31612375>Genome-wide identification and characterization of the AMPK genes and their distinct expression patterns in response to air exposure in the Manila clam (Ruditapes philippinarum).</a></h1><p>AMP-activated protein kinases (AMPK) are heterotrimeric complexes. The main upstream phosphorylase has AMP-dependent LKB1 and Ca-dependent CaMKK beta. AMPK also includes an auto-inhibitory domain and a region associated with beta and gamma subunits, which regulate a variety of cellular activities and energy metabolism. The increase in the ratio of AMP/ATP can stimulate the activation of AMPK. Once AMPK is activated, pathways to ATP consumption (e.g., fat, cholesterol, and protein synthesis) will be shut down. The pathway to ATP generation (e.g., oxidation of fat and  pathway) will be activated. AMPK genes have not been systematically characterized in marine invertebrates.In this study, we identified and characterized three AMPK genes, AMPK-α, AMPK-β, and AMPK-γ, in the Manila clam (Ruditapes philippinarum). To gain insight into the role of AMPK genes during clam energy metabolism, quantitative real-time PCR was used to investigate the expression profiles in the different stages of clam development, in healthy adult tissues, and after air exposure at two different temperatures.Phylogenetic and protein structural analyses were conducted to determine the identity and evolutionary relationships of these genes. The structural features of the genes were relatively well-conserved, relative to the AMPK genes of other vertebrates. The expression of genes was significantly induced 3-48 h after air exposure.AMPK-α, AMPK-β and AMPK-γ are involved in clam energy metabolism. Increased expression levels of AMPK genes in the gill and intestine of Manila clam in response to air exposure implied a strong adaptability to the coastal environment.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31590319>The Absence of Pyruvate Kinase Affects Glucose-Dependent Carbon Catabolite Repression in .</a></h1><p>Pyruvate is a key intermediate of diverse metabolic pathways of central carbon metabolism. In addition to being the end product of , pyruvate is an essential carbon distribution point to oxidative metabolism, amino acid and fatty acid syntheses, and overflow metabolite production. Hence, a tight regulation of pyruvate kinase (Pyk) activity is of great importance. This study aimed to analyze targeted metabolites from several pathways and possible changes in  lacking Pyk. Wild type and Δpyk cells were cultivated in chemically defined medium with glucose and pyruvate as carbon sources, and the extracted metabolites were analyzed by H-NMR, GC-MS, HPLC-MS, and LC-MS/MS. The results showed that the perturbation created in the pyruvate node drove an adaptation to new conditions by altering the nutritional compounds' consumption. In Δpyk, pyruvate, which is subject to glucose-dependent carbon catabolite repression, did not comply with the hierarchy in carbon source utilization. Other metabolic alterations were observed such as the higher secretion of the overflow metabolites acetoin and 2,3-butanediol by Δpyk. Our results help to elucidate the regulatory transport of glucose and pyruvate in  and possible metabolic reroute to alternative pathways in the absence of Pyk.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31631816>Monocarboxylate transporter 1: A promising drug-delivery target in the treatment of brain diseases and cancers.</a></h1><p>Monocarboxylate transporter 1 (MCT1), an important membrane transport protein, mediates the translocation of monocarboxylates together with protons across biological membranes. Because of its pathological significance, MCT1 plays an important role in the progression of some diseases, such as brain diseases and cancers.We summarize the general description of MCT1 and provide a comprehensive understanding of the role of MCT1 in brain diseases and cancers. Furthermore, this review discusses the challenges and opportunities of MCT1-targeting drug-delivery systems in the treatment of brain diseases and cancers.In the brain, loss of MCT1 function is associated with pathologies of degeneration and injury of the nervous system. In tumors, MCT1 regulates the activity of signaling pathways and controls the exchange of monocarboxylates in aerobic  to affect tumor metabolism, proliferation and invasion. Meanwhile, MCT1 also acts as a good biomarker for the prediction and diagnosis of cancer progressions.MCT1 is an attractive transporter in brain diseases and cancers. However, the mechanism of action for MCT1 is unclear and the application of MCT1 inhibitors in clinic is limited. This review systematically summarizes the basic characteristics of MCT1 and its role in brain diseases and cancer, laying the foundation for further research on MCT1.Copyright© Bentham Science Publishers; For any queries, please email at epub@benthamscience.net.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668988>Adapt and conquer: Metabolic flexibility in cancer growth, invasion and evasion.</a></h1><p>It has been known for close to a century that, on average, tumors have a metabolism that is different from those found in healthy tissues. Typically, tumors show a biosynthetic metabolism that distinguishes itself by engaging in large scale aerobic , heightened flux through the pentose phosphate pathway, and increased glutaminolysis among other means. However, it is becoming equally clear that non tumorous tissues at times can engage in similar metabolism, while tumors show a high degree of metabolic flexibility reacting to cues, and stresses in their local environment.In this review, we want to scrutinize historic and recent research on metabolism, comparing and contrasting oncogenic and physiological metabolic states. This will allow us to better define states of bona fide tumor metabolism. We will further contextualize the stress response and the metabolic evolutionary trajectory seen in tumors, and how these contribute to tumor progression. Lastly, we will analyze the implications of these characteristics with respect to therapy response.In our review, we argue that there is not one single oncogenic state, but rather a diverse set of oncogenic states. These are grounded on a physiological proliferative/wound healing program but distinguish themselves due to their large scale of proliferation, mutations, and transcriptional changes in key metabolic pathways, and the adaptations to widespread stress signals within tumors. We find evidence for the necessity of metabolic flexibility and stress responses in tumor progression and how these responses in turn shape oncogenic progression. Lastly, we find evidence for the notion that the metabolic adaptability of tumors frequently frustrates therapeutic interventions.Copyright © 2019 The Francis Crick Institute.

In this study, glucose and glutamine metabolism-related markers were examined in stage I - resectable stage IIIA non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Furthermore, expression of metabolism-related markers was correlated with mutational status to examine mutations associated with rewired tumor metabolism.Mutation analysis was performed for 97 tumors. Glucose and glutamine metabolism-related marker expression was measured by immunofluorescent staining (protein) and qPCR (mRNA) (n = 81).Glutamine metabolism-related markers were significantly higher in adeno- than squamous cell NSCLCs. Glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) protein expression was higher in solid compared to lepidic adenocarcinomas (P < 0.01). In adenocarcinomas, mRNA expression of glutamine transporter SLC1A5 correlated with tumor size (r(p) = 0.41, P = 0.005). Furthermore, SLC1A5 protein expression was significantly higher in adenocarcinomas with worse pTNM stage (r(s) = 0.39, P = 0.009). EGFR-mutated tumors showed lower GLUT1 protein (P = 0.017), higher glutaminase 2 (GLS2) protein (P = 0.025) and higher GLS2 mRNA expression (P = 0.004), compared to EGFR wild-type tumors. GLS mRNA expression was higher in KRAS-mutated tumors (P = 0.019). TP53-mutated tumors showed higher GLUT1 expression (P = 0.009).NSCLC is a heterogeneous disease, with differences in mutational status and metabolism-related marker expression between adeno- and squamous cell NSCLCs, and also within adenocarcinoma subtypes. GLUT1 and SLC1A5 expression correlate with aggressive tumor behavior in adenocarcinomas but not in squamous cell NSCLCs. Therefore, these markers could steer treatment modification for subgroups of adenocarcinoma patients. TP53, EGFR and KRAS mutations are associated with expression of glucose and glutamine metabolism-related markers in NSCLC.© 2019 The Authors.

The identification of key molecules involved in LUSC is therefore required to improve clinical diagnosis and treatment outcomes. The present study used the microarray datasets GSE31552, GSE6044 and GSE12428 from the Gene Expression Omnibus database to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analyses were conducted to construct the protein-protein interaction network of DEGs and hub genes module using STRING and Cytoscape. The 67 DEGs identified consisted of 42 upregulated genes and 25 downregulated genes. The pathways predicted by KEGG and GO enrichment analyses of DEGs mainly included cell cycle, cell proliferation,  or gluconeogenesis, and tetrahydrofolate metabolic process. Further analysis of the University of California Santa Cruz and ONCOMINE databases identified 17 hub genes. Overall, the present study demonstrated hub genes that were closely associated with clinical tissue samples of LUSC, and identified TYMS, CCNB2 and RFC4 as potential novel biomarkers of LUSC.

Transcriptomic analyses of patient NSCLC tumors stratified by survival times have identified the PTEN-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1) as a molecular governor of tumor aggressiveness and patient survival time. PINK1 has been shown to confer neuroprotection in models of Parkinson Disease by ensuring proper mitochondrial turnover (mitophagy), the upkeep of ATP production and sequestering of reactive oxygen species (ROS).We utilized an shRNA against PINK1 and the glycolytic inhibitor 3-BP to assess effects on NSCLC viability via MTS cell viability assay. ATP levels, caspase-9 activation, mitophagy and ROS production were determined with standardly available kits. Cytochrome c cellular localization and phosphorylated parkin levels were determined using an ELISA.Our results demonstrate that PINK1 depletion in the NSCLC cell line A549 via shRNA, reduced cancer cell proliferation, increased cell death, reduced ATP production, inhibited mitophagy and increased ROS and caspase-9-dependent apoptosis. PINK1 depleted cells were more susceptible to the glycolytic inhibitor 3-bromopyruvate (3-BP), which further perturbed ATP production. PINK1 depletion and 3-BP synergistically increased ROS production, caspase-9-dependent apoptosis and additively repressed mitophagy.These results suggest that PINK1 depletion alters energetic metabolism and confers sensitivity to agents that inhibit .

Aerobic , featured with elevated glucose consumption and lactate production, confers selective advantages on GBM by utilizing nutrients to support rapid cell proliferation and tumor growth. Pyruvate kinase 2 (PKM2), the last rate-limiting enzyme of , is known to regulate aerobic , and considered as a novel cancer therapeutic target. Herein, we aim to describe the cellular functions and mechanisms of a small molecular compound dimethylaminomicheliolide (DMAMCL), which has been used in clinical trials for recurrent GBM in Australia. Our results demonstrate that DMAMCL is effective on the inhibition of GBM cell proliferation and colony formation. MCL, the active metabolic form of DMAMCL, selectively binding to monomeric PKM2 and promoting its tetramerization, was also found to improve the pyruvate kinase activity of PKM2 in GBM cells. In addition, non-targeting metabolomics analysis reveals multiple metabolites involved in , including lactate and glucose-6-phosphate, are decreased with DMAMCL treatment. The inhibitory effects of DMAMCL are observed to decrease in GBM cells upon PKM2 depletion, further confirming the importance of PKM2 in DMAMCL sensitivity. In conclusion, the activation of PKM2 by DMAMCL results in the rewiring aerobic , which consequently suppresses the proliferation of GBM cells.

Shikonin (SKN), a natural naphthoquinone with anti-inflammatory activity, has shown to exert cardioprotective effects, but the effect of SKN on atherosclerosis is unclear. In addition, SKN was found to inhibit  via targeting pyruvate kinase muscle isozyme 2 (PKM2). In the present study, we investigated the effects of SKN on hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy)-accelerated atherosclerosis and T cell inflammatory activation in ApoE mice and the metabolic mechanisms in this process. Drinking water supplemented with Hcy (1.8 g/L) was administered to ApoE mice for 2 weeks and the mice were injected with SKN (1.2 mg/kg, i.p.) or vehicle every 3 days. We showed that SKN treatment markedly attenuated HHcy-accelerated atherosclerosis in ApoE mice and significantly decreased inflammatory activated CD4 T cells and proinflammatory macrophages in plaques. In splenic CD4 T cells isolated from HHcy-ApoE mice, SKN treatment significantly inhibited HHcy-stimulated PKM2 activity, interferon-γ secretion and the capacity of these T cells to promote macrophage proinflammatory polarization. SKN treatment significantly inhibited HHcy-stimulated CD4 T cell  and oxidative phosphorylation. Metabolic profiling analysis of CD4 T cells revealed that Hcy administration significantly increased various glucose metabolites as well as lipids and acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1, which were reversed by SKN treatment. In conclusion, our results suggest that SKN is effective to ameliorate atherosclerosis in HHcy-ApoE mice and this is at least partly associated with the inhibition of SKN on CD4 T cell inflammatory activation via PKM2-dependent metabolic suppression.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31620662>Altered metabolism for neuroprotection provided by mesenchymal stem cells.</a></h1><p>Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multipotent adult stem cells which have become popular research targets for their use in cellular therapy for tissue repair.

A complete understanding of how MSCs' cellular metabolism affects their function is necessary for their employment in cellular therapy, as MSCs have been demonstrated to have pro- and anti-inflammatory functions. These findings are a large step forward in the understanding of the regulation of MSCs and toward their eventual use in cellular therapy, specifically for stroke recovery, in which MSCs have been shown to have powerful neuroprotective and neurogenerative effects.Copyright: © 2019 Brain Circulation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31648290>Co-opting the fermentation pathway for tombusvirus replication: Compartmentalization of cellular metabolic pathways for rapid ATP generation.</a></h1><p>The viral replication proteins of plus-stranded RNA viruses orchestrate the biogenesis of the large viral replication compartments, including the numerous viral replicase complexes, which represent the sites of viral RNA replication. The formation and operation of these virus-driven structures require subversion of numerous cellular proteins, membrane deformation, membrane proliferation, changes in lipid composition of the hijacked cellular membranes and intensive viral RNA synthesis. These virus-driven processes require plentiful ATP and molecular building blocks produced at the sites of replication or delivered there. To obtain the necessary resources from the infected cells, tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV) rewires cellular metabolic pathways by co-opting aerobic glycolytic enzymes to produce ATP molecules within the replication compartment and enhance virus production. However, aerobic  requires the replenishing of the NAD+ pool. In this paper, we demonstrate the efficient recruitment of pyruvate decarboxylase (Pdc1) and alcohol dehydrogenase (Adh1) fermentation enzymes into the viral replication compartment. Depletion of Pdc1 in combination with deletion of the homologous PDC5 in yeast or knockdown of Pdc1 and Adh1 in plants reduced the efficiency of tombusvirus replication. Complementation approach revealed that the enzymatically functional Pdc1 is required to support tombusvirus replication. Measurements with an ATP biosensor revealed that both Pdc1 and Adh1 enzymes are required for efficient generation of ATP within the viral replication compartment. In vitro reconstitution experiments with the viral replicase show the pro-viral function of Pdc1 during the assembly of the viral replicase and the activation of the viral p92 RdRp, both of which require the co-opted ATP-driven Hsp70 protein chaperone. We propose that compartmentalization of the co-opted fermentation pathway in the tombusviral replication compartment benefits the virus by allowing for the rapid production of ATP locally, including replenishing of the regulatory NAD+ pool by the fermentation pathway. The compartmentalized production of NAD+ and ATP facilitates their efficient use by the co-opted ATP-dependent host factors to support robust tombusvirus replication. We propose that compartmentalization of the fermentation pathway gives an evolutionary advantage for tombusviruses to replicate rapidly to speed ahead of antiviral responses of the hosts and to outcompete other pathogenic viruses. We also show the dependence of turnip crinkle virus, bamboo mosaic virus, tobacco mosaic virus and the insect-infecting Flock House virus on the fermentation pathway, suggesting that a broad range of viruses might induce this pathway to support rapid replication.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661165>Why Do Intravascular Schistosomes Coat Themselves in Glycolytic Enzymes?</a></h1><p>Schistosomes are intravascular parasitic helminths (blood flukes) that infect more than 200 million people globally. Proteomic analysis of the tegument (skin) of these worms has revealed the surprising presence of glycolytic enzymes on the parasite's external surface. Immunolocalization data as well as enzyme activity displayed by live worms confirm that functional glycolytic enzymes are indeed expressed at the host-parasite interface. Since these enzymes are traditionally considered to function intracellularly to drive , in an extracellular location they are hypothesized to engage in novel "moonlighting" functions such as immune modulation and blood clot dissolution that promote parasite survival. For instance, several glycolytic enzymes can interact with plasminogen and promote its activation to the thrombolytic plasmin; some can inhibit complement function; some induce B cell proliferation or macrophage apoptosis. Several pathogenic bacteria and protists also express glycolytic enzymes externally, suggesting that moonlighting functions of extracellular glycolytic enzymes can contribute broadly to pathogen virulence.© 2019 WILEY Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31627130>Phosphofructokinases Axis Controls Glucose-Dependent mTORC1 Activation Driven by E2F1.</a></h1><p>Cancer cells rely on mTORC1 activity to coordinate mitogenic signaling with nutrients availability for growth. Based on the metabolic function of E2F1, we hypothesize that glucose catabolism driven by E2F1 could participate on mTORC1 activation. Here, we demonstrate that glucose potentiates E2F1-induced mTORC1 activation by promoting mTORC1 translocation to lysosomes, a process that occurs independently of AMPK activation. We showed that E2F1 regulates glucose metabolism by increasing aerobic  and identified the PFKFB3 regulatory enzyme as an E2F1-regulated gene important for mTORC1 activation. Furthermore, PFKFB3 and PFK1 were found associated to lysosomes and we demonstrated that modulation of PFKFB3 activity, either by substrate accessibility or expression, regulates the translocation of mTORC1 to lysosomes by direct interaction with Rag B and subsequent mTORC1 activity. Our results support a model whereby a glycolytic metabolon containing phosphofructokinases transiently interacts with the lysosome acting as a sensor platform for glucose catabolism toward mTORC1 activity.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

D-Galactose-induced aging mice are an artificial accelerated aging model that causes memory and learning impairment, oxidative stress, and neuroinflammation. In this study, we examined the underlying mechanism of an aging mouse model induced by D-galactose. Our behavioral Morris water maze results revealed that D-galactose administration for 2 months significantly induced memory and learning impairment in C57BL/6J mice. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) results showed elevated levels of the metabolite methylglyoxal (MG) in D-galactose-induced aging mice. Whether and how D-galactose induces senescence by elevated levels of reactive metabolite MG remain unclear. In our study, MG mainly accumulated through the following two aspects: to increase its source, namely, the triose phosphate produced by the  pathway, and to reduce its detoxification system, namely, the glyoxalase system. Therefore, elevated MG levels may be one of the causes of brain senescence in D-galactose-induced mice. However, the molecular mechanism of the increased level of the reaction metabolite methylglyoxal requires further exploration.Copyright © 2019 Li, Zheng, Chen, Liu and Zhang.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31629121>Prognostic value of F-FDG PET/MR imaging biomarkers in oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma.</a></h1><p>To correlate the clinical stage and prognosis of oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) using the imaging biomarkers from integrated positron emission tomography (PET)/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).In total, 54 consecutive patients with oesophageal SCC who receive PET/MRI scan were recruited before treatment. The imaging biomarkers used were the mean and minimal apparent diffusion coefficients (ADC and ADC), standardized uptake value (SUV), metabolic tumour volume (MTV), and total lesion  (TLG) of tumours. The correlation between each imaging biomarker and survival was investigated using the Cox proportional hazards model.ADC was negatively correlated with SUV (r = -0.414, P =  0.025). ADC was negatively correlated with SUV (r = -0.423, P =  0.001) and SUV (r = -0.402, P =  0.003), and was significantly lower in M1 than in M0 tumours (829.6 vs. 1069.8, P = 0.005). MTV was significantly higher in T3 + (P <  0.001), N1 + (P = 0.014) and TNM stage III + (P <  0.001) tumours. TLG was significantly higher in T3 + (P <  0.001), N1 + (P <  0.001), M1 (P =  0.045) and TNM stage III + (P <  0.001) tumours. The MTV/ADC ratio exhibited the highest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) for predicting M1 and advanced TNM stage tumours. Multivariate analysis for progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) showed that a larger MTV/ADC was associated with a shorter PFS and OS (P = 0.024 and 0.046, respectively).The imaging biomarkers in integrated PET/MRI may predict clinical stage and survival in patients with oesophageal SCC.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

However, it is not known for its role in tumorigenesis of colorectal cancer (CRC). Herein, we show that Wnt3 is upregulated in human CRC tissues and is essential for the CRC progression. Knockdown of Wnt3 in human CRC cells delayed tumor formation in nude mouse xenografts through silencing of canonical Wnt pathway and . We further found that silencing of Wnt3 enhanced the sensitivity of CRC cells to cisplatin through inducing apoptotic cell death. Taken together, it demonstrates that Wnt3 is a novel clinical biomarker for the detection of CRC and plays an important role in colorectal tumorigenesis. Therefore, downregulation of Wnt3 will be a valuable strategy in CRC treatment.Copyright © 2019 Nie, Xia, Liu, Zhou, Ye, Hean, Meng, Liu, Liu, Wen, Ren, Chen and Wang.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31572189>Bio-Inspired Silver Nanoparticles Impose Metabolic and Epigenetic Toxicity to .</a></h1><p>Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) have many applications in various fields, including biomedical applications. Due to the broad range of applications, they are considered as the leading fraction of manufactured nanoparticles. AgNPs are synthesized by different types of chemical and biological (green) methods. Previously, biologically synthesized AgNPs were considered safe for the environment and humans. However, new toxicity evidence have initiated a more careful assessment to delineate the toxicity mechanisms associated with these nanoparticles. This study demonstrates the use of aqueous gooseberry extract for AgNP preparation in a time- and cost-effective way. Ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, and dynamic light scattering confirm the formation of AgNPs, with an average size between 50 and 100 nm. Untargeted H-nuclear magnetic resonance-based metabolomics revealed manyfold up- and down-regulation in the concentration of 55 different classes of annotated metabolites in AgNP-exposed yeast  cells. Based on their chemical nature and cellular functions, these metabolites are classified into amino acids,  and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, organic acids, nucleotide metabolism, urea cycle, and lipid metabolism. Transcriptome analysis revealed that the genes involved in oxidative stress mitigation maintain their expression levels, whereas the genes of the TCA cycle and lipid metabolism show drastic down-regulation upon AgNP exposure. Moreover, they can induce alteration in histone epigenetic marks by altering the methylation and acetylation of selected histone H3 and H4 proteins. Altogether, we conclude that the selected dose of biologically synthesized AgNPs impose toxicity by modulating the transcriptome, epigenome, and metabolome of eukaryotic cells, which eventually cause disequilibrium in cellular metabolism leading to toxicity.Copyright © 2019 Babele, Singh and Srivastava.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649986>Effects of different tube types on patient classification using current diabetes decision limits.</a></h1><p>Management of diabetes is a challenge starting in the pre-analytical phase with selecting the most appropriate  inhibitor. Study goal was to calculate the impact of tubes with different  inhibitors on the classification of the glycemic control of 157,415 consecutive hospital patients according to current WHO diabetes criteria.Glucose and lactate were measured in parallel in samples from 68 healthy subjects collected and stored in different sample tubes from Sarstedt and Greiner. Bias to baseline conditions (fluoride heparin (FH) tubes, centrifugation within 1 h) was determined.In baseline samples, glucose concentration in fluoride/EDTA/citrate (FC) plasma was ~13% higher and lactate concentration ~20% lower compared to FH, fluoride oxalate, and fluoride EDTA plasma, and in serum. Glucose recovery after storage up to 48 h was 99-101% in the different tubes, but the effectiveness of  inhibition by FC was inconsistent. Based on the observed mean bias of 12% when FC tubes are used, we estimate an increase of 48.4-55.8% in the frequency of patients with impaired glucose levels using current WHO criteria.Using current established decision limits, the number of patients with impaired glucose levels in the hospital would increase substantially with a strong impact on patient treatment and consumption of resources. The unpredictable failure of  inhibition in FC tubes does not allow to adjust the decision limits by a fixed factor. In the absence of prospective outcome studies with FC tubes, we recommend to measure glucose in samples containing FH.© 2019 The Authors.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31580525>Variation in energy metabolism arising from the effect of the tumor microenvironment on cell biological behaviors of bladder cancer cells and endothelial cells.</a></h1><p>Tumor energy metabolism and angiogenesis play significant roles in tumor genesis and development, while the effect of the tumor microenvironment (TME), which tumors rely on, is always ignored. In this research, we cocultured bladder cancer (BC) T24 cells with tumor-associated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) under normoxic and hypoxic conditions and detected proliferation, migration, oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and  to reveal the energy metabolism characteristics and their effect on cell biological behaviors (CBBs) in the TME. Compared with single-cultured cells, both cocultured T24 cells and HUVECs showed poor proliferation and migration in hypoxic environment, and OXPHOS was activated in cocultured T24 cells but weakened in cocultured HUVECs. However, in normoxic environment, cocultured T24 cells grew much faster while cocultured HUVECs grew slower compared with single-cultured cells. Additionally,  played a crucial role in energy metabolism and was inhibited in cocultured T24 cells but activated in cocultured HUVECs. In normoxic TME, OXPHOS take main responsibility of energy metabolism. T24 cells exhibited increased proliferation and migration with HUVECs support. In hypoxic TME,  may be the primary energy supply pathway. T24 cells then exhibit suppressed proliferation and migration, while HUVECs tend to promote angiogenesis to adapt to the harsh TME.© 2019 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31604822>The E3 ubiquitin ligase Pib1 regulates effective gluconeogenic shutdown upon glucose availability.</a></h1><p>Cells use multiple mechanisms to regulate their metabolic states in response to changes in their nutrient environment. One example is the response of cells to glucose. In S. cerevisiae growing in glucose-depleted medium, the re-availability of glucose leads to the downregulation of gluconeogenesis, and the activation of , leading to 'glucose repression'. However, our knowledge of the mechanisms mediating the glucose dependent downregulation of the gluconeogenic transcription factors is limited. Using a major gluconeogenic transcription factor Rds2 as a candidate, here we identify a novel role for the E3 ubiquitin ligase Pib1 in regulating the stability and degradation of Rds2. Glucose addition to cells growing in glucose limitation results in rapid ubiquitination of Rds2, followed by its proteasomal degradation. Through in vivo and in vitro experiments, we establish Pib1 as the ubiquitin E3 ligase that regulates Rds2 ubiquitination and stability. Notably, this Pib1 mediated Rds2 ubiquitination, followed by proteasomal degradation, is specific to the presence of glucose. This Pib1 mediated ubiquitination of Rds2 depends on the phosphorylation state of Rds2, suggesting a cross-talk between ubiquitination and phosphorylation to achieve a metabolic state change. Using stable-isotope based metabolic flux experiments we find that the loss of Pib1 results in an imbalanced gluconeogenic state, regardless of glucose availability. Pib1 is required for complete glucose repression, and enables cells to optimally grow in competitive environments when glucose becomes re-available. Our results reveal the existence of a Pib1 mediated regulatory program that mediates glucose-repression when glucose availability is restored.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670806>Interleukin-6 confers radio-resistance by inducing Akt mediated  and reducing mitochondrial damage in cells.</a></h1><p>Interleukin-6 (IL-6) induced  and therapeutic resistance is reported in some cell systems; however the mechanism of IL-6 induced  in radio-resistance is un-explored. Therefore to investigate, we treated Raw264.7 cells with IL-6 (1hr prior to irradiation) and examined the glycolytic flux. Increased expression of mRNA and protein levels of key glycolytic enzymes was observed after IL-6 treatment, which conferred  dependent resistance from radiation induced cell death. We further established that IL-6 induced  is activated by Akt signaling and knocking down Akt or inhibition of pan Akt phosphorylation significantly abrogated the IL-6 induced radio-resistance. Moreover, reduction of IL-6 induced pAkt level suppressed the expression of Hexokinase-2 and its translocation to the mitochondria, thereby inhibiting the  induced resistance to radiation. IL-6 induced  also minimized the radiation induced mitochondrial damage. These results suggest that IL-6 induced  observed in cells may be responsible for IL-6 mediated therapeutic radio-resistance in cancer cells, partly by activation of Akt signaling.© The Author(s) 2019.

However, the role of AS in myocardial oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) injury has not been investigated. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of AS in OGD/R-treated H9c2 cardiomyocytes and the underlying mechanism involved. Cell viability was detected using MTT assay. Cell apoptosis was measured using flow cytometry. The oxidative stress was assessed by detecting the malonaldehyde (MDA) content, and activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), and catalase (CAT). The glucose consumption and lactate production were determined to reflect  rate. The expression levels of hexokinase II (HK2) were detected using RT-qPCR and western blot. H9c2 cells were transfected with small interfering RNA targeting HK2 (si-HK2) to knockdown HK2. Results showed that AS improved cell viability and inhibited apoptosis in OGD/R-injured H9c2 cells. AS pretreatment prevented OGD/R-induced oxidative stress, as evidenced by the decreased MDA content, and increased activities of SOD, GSH-Px, and CAT. The decreased glucose consumption and lactate production in OGD/R-injured H9c2 cells were reversed after AS treatment. Mechanically, AS induced the expression of HK2 in OGD/R-injured H9c2 cells. Knockdown of HK2 abolished the protective effects of AS on OGD/R-injured H9c2 cells. In conclusion, the protective effects of AS on cardiomyocytes from OGD/R-induced injury was mediated at least partly by up-regulating HK2.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31623133>The Many Facets of Tumor Heterogeneity: Is Metabolism Lagging Behind?</a></h1><p>Tumor functional heterogeneity has been recognized for decades, and technological advancements are fueling renewed interest in uncovering the cell-intrinsic and extrinsic factors that influence tumor development and therapeutic response. Intratumoral heterogeneity is now arguably one of the most-studied topics in tumor biology, leading to the discovery of new paradigms and reinterpretation of old ones, as we aim to understand the profound implications that genomic, epigenomic, and functional heterogeneity hold with regard to clinical outcomes. In spite of our improved understanding of the biological complexity of cancer, characterization of tumor metabolic heterogeneity has lagged behind, lost in a century-old controversy debating whether  or mitochondrial respiration is more influential. But is tumor metabolism really so simple? Here, we review historical and current views of intratumoral heterogeneity, with an emphasis on summarizing the emerging data that begin to illuminate just how vast the spectrum of metabolic strategies a tumor can employ may be, and what this means for how we might interpret other tumor characteristics, such as mutational landscape, contribution of microenvironmental influences, and treatment resistance.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31635221>The Expression Pattern of  in Sheep Muscle and Its Role in Differentiation, Cell Proliferation, and Apoptosis of Myoblasts.</a></h1><p>The complement 1q binding protein C (), also known as , is highly expressed in rapidly growing tissues and plays a crucial role in cell proliferation and apoptosis.

Pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) is a metabolic enzyme that converts pyruvate into acetyl-CoA, connecting  to the TCA cycle, thus regulating cellular energy metabolism. PDH is involved in multiple cellular processes, such as glucose metabolism, fatty acid synthesis, and protein acetylation, all of which are mediated by acetyl-CoA. We previously demonstrated that PDH-E1β is downregulated in prolonged hypoxia and inhibits PDH activity, which serves as machinery to securely inhibit PDH activity together with PDH-E1α phosphorylation. PDH has been identified to localize to the nucleus in addition to mitochondria, but its precise regulatory mechanisms in the nucleus remain elusive. In the present study, we characterized nuclear PDH during prolonged hypoxia. Nuclear PDH complex was downregulated under hypoxic conditions, and PDH activity was reduced. Depletion of HIF-1α partly recovered nuclear levels of the PDH complex. Furthermore, decreased nuclear PDH activity resulted in reduced histone H3 acetylation, altering the gene expression profile of cells exposed to prolonged hypoxia. Taken together, these findings indicate that nuclear PDH complex is downregulated under prolonged hypoxic conditions and controls gene expression.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The green alga  is currently used for commercial production of astaxanthin pigment. However, slow growing  requires a complex two-stage stress-induced process with high light intensity leading to increased contamination risks. In contrast, the fast-growing euryhaline cyanobacterium  sp. PCC 7002 ( 7002) is able to reach high density under stress-free phototrophic conditions, and is therefore a promising metabolic engineering platform for astaxanthin production. In the present study, genes encoding β-carotene hydroxylase and β-carotene ketolase, from the marine bacterium  sp. SD212, are integrated into the endogenous plasmid of  7002, and then expressed to biosynthesize astaxanthin. Although  7002 does not inherently produce astaxanthin, the recombinant ZW strain yields 3 mg/g-dry cell weight astaxanthin from CO as the sole carbon source, with significantly higher astaxanthin content than previous cyanobacteria reports.  7002 astaxanthin productivity reached 3.35 mg/L/day after just 2 days in a continuous autotrophic process, which is comparable to the best  astaxanthin productivities when factoring in growth times. Metabolomics analysis reveals increases in fractions of hexose-, pentose- and triose phosphates along with intermediates involved in the non-mevalonate pathway. Dynamic metabolomics analysis of C labeled metabolites clearly indicates flux enhancements in the Calvin cycle and  resulting from the overexpression of astaxanthin biosynthetic genes.

Since the effect of empagliflozin or other SGLT2 inhibitors on the whole cardiac metabolic profile was never analysed before, and with the purpose to contribute to elucidate the benefits at cardiac level of the use of empagliflozin, we explored the effect of the treatment with empagliflozin for six weeks on the cardiac metabolomic profile of Zucker diabetic fatty rats, a model of early stage T2DM, using untargeted metabolomics approach. Empagliflozin reduced significantly the cardiac content of sphingolipids (ceramides and sphingomyelins) and glycerophospholipids (major bioactive contributing factors linking insulin resistance to cardiac damage) and decreased the cardiac content of the fatty acid transporter cluster of differentiation 36 (CD36); induced significant decreases of the cardiac levels of essential  intermediaries 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate and phosphoenolpyruvate, and regulated the abundance of several amino acids of relevance as tricarboxylic acid suppliers and/or in the metabolic control of the cardiac function as glutamic acid, gamma-aminobutyric acid and sarcosine.

We aimed to assess the role of GSTZ1 in HCC and to reveal the underlying mechanisms, which may contribute to finding a potential therapeutic strategy against HCC.We first analyzed GSTZ1 expression levels in paired human HCC and adjacent normal tissue specimens and the prognostic effect of GSTZ1 on HCC patients. Thereafter, we evaluated the role of GSTZ1 in aerobic  in HCC cells on the basis of the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) and extracellular acidification rate (ECAR). Furthermore, we assessed the effect of GSTZ1 on HCC proliferation, glutathione (GSH) concentration, levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) signaling via gain- and loss- of GSTZ1 function in vitro. Moreover, we investigated the effect of GSTZ1 on diethylnitrosamine (DEN) and carbon tetrachloride (CCl) induced hepatocarcinogenesis in a mouse model of HCC.GSTZ1 was downregulated in HCC, thus indicating a poor prognosis. GSTZ1 deficiency significantly promoted hepatoma cell proliferation and aerobic  in HCC cells. Moreover, loss of GSTZ1 function depleted GSH, increased ROS levels, and enhanced lipid peroxidation, thus activating the NRF2-mediated antioxidant pathway. Furthermore, Gstz1 knockout in mice promoted DEN/CCl-induced hepatocarcinogenesis via activation of the NRF2 signaling pathway. Furthermore, the antioxidant agent N-acetylcysteine and NRF2 inhibitor brusatol effectively suppressed the growth of Gstz1-knockout HepG2 cells and HCC progression in Gstz1 mice.GSTZ1 serves as a tumor suppressor in HCC. GSH depletion caused by GSTZ1 deficiency elevates oxidative stress, thus constitutively activating the NRF2 antioxidant response pathway and accelerating HCC progression.

Furthermore, a series of rescue experiments were performed to demonstrate that the role of lncRNA NBAT-1 in EC cell proliferation, cell growth and tumor  was partially dependent on the PKM2 protein, which is a key metabolic enzyme in tumor development. Taken together, our data illustrate a functional role for lncRNA NBAT-1 in metabolic reprogramming in EC cancer; thus, lncRNA NBAT-1 might be a potential clinical therapeutic target in EC patients.AJTR Copyright © 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31639424>SIK2 promotes reprogramming of glucose metabolism through PI3K/AKT/HIF-1α pathway and Drp1-mediated mitochondrial fission in ovarian cancer.</a></h1><p>Salt-inducible kinase 2 (SIK2), which belongs to the AMP-activated protein kinase family, modulates various biological functions including fatty acid oxidation. However, the role of SIK2 in glucose metabolism reprogramming remains unclear in ovarian cancer (OC) cells. Here, we found that SIK2 significantly enhanced the Warburg effect of OC cells mainly through two mechanisms. On the one hand, SIK2 upregulated the expression of HIF-1α by activating the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, which directly upregulated the transcription of major glycolytic genes to promote . On the other hand, SIK2 promoted mitochondrial fission through phosphorylation of Drp1 at Ser616 site, which inhibited the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. In addition, SIK2 promoted growth and metastasis of OC cells by promoting cell proliferation and inhibiting cell apoptosis, as well as enhancing the epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Moreover, the SIK2-mediated reprogramming of glucose metabolism played a critical role in growth and metastasis of OC cells. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that SIK2 is a crucial regulator of glucose metabolism in OC cells through activation of PI3K/AKT/HIF-1α pathway and Drp1 phosphorylation-mediated mitochondrial fission, which plays a critical oncogenic role in OC cells.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, we determined the regulation of MPC-1 expression by Lysine demethylase 5A (KDM5A) and critical impact of this novel KDM5A/MPC-1 signaling on PDA progression. TCGA database, paired PDA and adjacent normal pancreatic tissues, PDA tissue array and cell lines were used to determine the levels of MPC-1 and KDM5A expression, and their relationship with the clinicopathologic characteristics and overall survival (OS) of PDA patients. Both in vitro and in vivo models were used to determine biologic impacts of MPC-1 and KDM5A on PDA and mitochondrial pyruvate metabolism, and the mechanism underling reduced MPC-1 expression in PDA. The expression of MPC-1 was decreased in PDA cell lines and tissues, and negatively associated with tumor poorer differentiation, lymph nodes metastasis, higher TNM stages, and patients' overall survival (OS). Functional analysis revealed that restored expression of MPC-1 suppressed the growth, invasion, migration, stemness and tumorigenicity. Re-expression of MPC-1 stimulated the mitochondrial pyruvate metabolism and inhibited , while MPC-1-specific inhibitor UK5099 attenuated these effects. Furthermore, KDM5A bound directly to MPC-1 promoter region and transcriptionally suppressed the expression of MPC-1 via demethylation H3K4. Consistently, KDM5A expression was elevated in PDA and promoted PDA cell proliferation in vitro and tumor growth in vivo via suppressing the expression of MPC-1. The expression of KDM5A was inversely correlated with that of MPC-1 in PDA. KDM5A/MPC-1 signaling promoted PDA growth, invasion, migration, and stemness via inhibiting mitochondrial pyruvate metabolism. Targeting KDM5A/MPC-1 signaling may be an effective therapeutic strategy for PDA.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670970>Side Chain Optimization Remarkably Enhances the In Vivo Stability of 18F-Labeled Glutamine for Tumor Imaging.</a></h1><p>Similar to , glutaminolysis acts as a vital energy source in tumor cells, providing building blocks for the metabolic needs of tumor cells. To capture glutaminolysis in tumors, 18F-(2S,4R)4-Fluoroglutamine ([18F]FGln) and 18F-fluoroboronoglutamine ([18F]FBQ) have been successfully developed for Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging, but these two molecules are lack of stability, resulting in undesired yet significant bone uptake. In this study, we found that [18F]FBQ-C2 is a stable Gln PET tracer by adding two more methylene groups to the side chain of [18F]FBQ. [18F]FBQ-C2 was synthesized with a good radiochemical yield (RCY) of 35% and over 98% radiochemical purity. [18F]FBQ-C2 showed extreme stability in vitro, and no defluorination was observed after 2 hours in phosphate buffered saline at 37 °C. The competitive inhibition assay results indicated that [18F]FBQ-C2 enters cells via system ASC and N, similar to natural glutamine, and can be transported by tumor-overexpressed ASCT2. PET imaging and biodistribution results indicated that [18F]FBQ-C2 is stable in vivo with low bone uptake (0.81±0.20%ID/g) and can be cleared rapidly from most tissues. Dynamic scan and pharmacokinetic studies using BGC823-xenograft-bearing mice revealed that [18F]FBQ-C2 accumulates specifically in tumors, with a longer half-life (101.18±6.50 min) in tumor tissues than in other tissues (52.70±12.44 min in muscle). Biodistribution exhibits a high tumor-to-normal tissue ratio (4.8±1.7 for muscle, 2.5±1.0 for the stomach, 2.2±0.9 for the liver and 17.8±8.4 for the brain). In conclusion, [18F]FBQ-C2 can be used to perform high-contrast Gln imaging of tumors and can serve as a PET tracer for clinical research.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31608565>Lysine acetylation contributes to development, aflatoxin biosynthesis and pathogenicity in Aspergillus flavus.</a></h1><p>Aspergillus flavus is a pathogenic fungus that produces carcinogenic aflatoxins, posing a great threat to crops, animals and humans. Lysine acetylation is one of the most important reversible post-translational modifications and plays a vital regulatory role in various cellular processes. However, current information on the extent and function of lysine acetylation and aflatoxin biosynthesis in A. flavus is limited. Here, a global acetylome analysis of A. flavus was performed by peptide pre-fractionation, pan-acetylation antibody enrichment and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. A total of 1313 high-confidence acetylation sites in 727 acetylated proteins were identified in A. flavus. These acetylation proteins are widely involved in /gluconeogenesis, pentose phosphate pathway, citric acid cycle and aflatoxin biosynthesis. AflO (O-methyltransferase), a key enzyme in aflatoxin biosynthesis, was found to be acetylated at K241 and K384. Deletion of aflO not only impaired conidial and sclerotial developments, but also dramatically suppressed aflatoxin production and pathogenicity of A. flavus. Further site-specific mutations showed that lysine acetylation of AflO could also result in defects in development, aflatoxin production and pathogenicity, suggesting that acetylation plays a vital role in the regulation of the enzymatic activity of AflO in A. flavus. Our findings provide evidence for the involvement of lysine acetylation in various biological processes in A. flavus and facilitating in the elucidation of metabolic networks.© 2019 Society for Applied Microbiology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31636306>PKM2 regulates endothelial cell junction dynamics and angiogenesis via ATP production.</a></h1><p>Angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels from pre-existing ones, occurs in pathophysiological contexts such as wound healing, cancer, and chronic inflammatory disease. During sprouting angiogenesis, endothelial tip and stalk cells coordinately remodel their cell-cell junctions to allow collective migration and extension of the sprout while maintaining barrier integrity. All these processes require energy, and the predominant ATP generation route in endothelial cells is . However, it remains unclear how ATP reaches the plasma membrane and intercellular junctions. In this study, we demonstrate that the glycolytic enzyme pyruvate kinase 2 (PKM2) is required for sprouting angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo through the regulation of endothelial cell-junction dynamics and collective migration. We show that PKM2-silencing decreases ATP required for proper VE-cadherin internalization/traffic at endothelial cell-cell junctions. Our study provides fresh insight into the role of ATP subcellular compartmentalization in endothelial cells during angiogenesis. Since manipulation of EC  constitutes a potential therapeutic intervention route, particularly in tumors and chronic inflammatory disease, these findings may help to refine the targeting of endothelial glycolytic activity in disease.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31636448>Age-related hyperinsulinemia leads to insulin resistance in neurons and cell-cycle-induced senescence.</a></h1><p>Prediabetes and Alzheimer's disease both increase in prevalence with age. The former is a risk factor for the latter, but a mechanistic linkage between them remains elusive. We show that prediabetic serum hyperinsulinemia is reflected in the cerebrospinal fluid and that this chronically elevated insulin renders neurons resistant to insulin. This leads to abnormal electrophysiological activity and other defects. In addition, neuronal insulin resistance reduces hexokinase 2, thus impairing . This hampers the ubiquitination and degradation of p35, favoring its cleavage to p25, which hyperactivates CDK5 and interferes with the GSK3β-induced degradation of β-catenin. CDK5 contributes to neuronal cell death while β-catenin enters the neuronal nucleus and re-activates the cell cycle machinery. Unable to successfully divide, the neuron instead enters a senescent-like state. These findings offer a direct connection between peripheral hyperinsulinemia, as found in prediabetes, age-related neurodegeneration and cognitive decline. The implications for neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease are described.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669174>Surveillance imaging after autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation predicts survival in patients with diffuse large B cell lymphoma.</a></h1><p>The utility of surveillance imaging after autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (AHCT) in relapsed/refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to determine whether surveillance imaging predicts survival after AHCT.At the University of Minnesota, serial imaging for early relapse detection has been used prospectively for all consecutive AHCT recipients treated since 2010. This analysis included 91 AHCT recipients with DLBCL who underwent (18)F-FDG-PET at day +100 post-AHCT. (18)F-FDG-PET parameters included the Deauville (D) five-point scale, peak standardized uptake values (SUVmax), total legion  (TLG) and total metabolic tumor volume (TMTV). Survival of patients with clinically symptomatic versus asymptomatic radiographically detected relapsed DLBCL after AHCT was compared.Sixty patients experienced relapse; 35% was detected on day +100 surveillance PET scan. 5-year overall survival (OS) by (18)F-FDG-PET scan at day +100 post-AHCT was significantly lower in D4 and D5 patients (37%, 95% CI=14-100 and 25%, 95%CI=43-89) as compared to patients with D1 and D2 (62%, 95% CI=43-89 and 62%, 95% CI=46-84). TLG and TMTV were not prognostic. SUVmax at day +100 varied 1.5 (D1) to 17.9 (D5). In multivariate analysis, only SUVmax was predictive of relapse and OS; mortality increased 1.8-fold with each SUVmax doubling (HR 1.8, 95% CI 1.3 to 2.3; p<0.01). At a median follow-up of 3.3 years (range 1-12 years), lymphoma-related mortality was 1.8-fold higher among patients whose relapse was detected clinically (symptomatic) versus radiographically on surveillance scan (HR 1.8 [95% CI 0.9 to 3.4]; p=0.08).In patients with relapsed/refractory DLBCL, a routine PET imaging at day +100 post-AHCT detects asymptomatic relapse and high SUVmax identifies patients with poor expected survival of less than 1 year. Identifying this high-risk cohort can potentially highlight patients that might benefit from preemptive interventions to prevent or delay relapse.Copyright © 2019.

During early osteoarthritis, hyaluronan and aggrecan loss are a first sign of tissue damage. However, our recent attempts to mimic hyaluronan loss with the hyaluronan inhibitor 4-methylumbelliferone (4MU) did not exacerbate arthritis-like features of in vitro models of arthritis, but surprisingly, caused the reverse, namely, provided potent chondroprotection. Moreover, the protective effects of 4MU did not depend on its role as a hyaluronan inhibitor. To understand the molecular mechanism in 4MU-mediated chondroprotection, we considered recent studies suggesting that shifts in intracellular UDP-hexose pools promote changes in metabolism. To determine whether such metabolic shifts are associated with the mechanism of 4MU-mediated pro-catabolic inhibition, using molecular and metabolomics approaches, we examined whether bovine and human chondrocytes exhibit changes in the contribution of  and mitochondrial respiration to ATP production rates as well as in other factors that respond to or might drive these changes. Both overexpression of HA synthase-2 and 4MU effectively reduced dependence on  in chondrocytes, especially enhanced  use by interleukin-1β (IL1β)-activated chondrocytes. The reduction in  secondarily enhanced mitochondrial respiration in chondrocytes, which, in turn, rescued phospho-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) levels in the activated chondrocytes. Other  inhibitors, unrelated to hyaluronan biosynthesis, namely 2-deoxyglucose and dichloroacetate, caused metabolic changes in chondrocytes equivalent to those elicited by 4MU and similarly protected both chondrocytes and cartilage explants. These results suggest that fluxes in UDP-hexoses alter metabolic energy pathways in cartilage.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31653834>DNA damage and transcription stress cause ATP-mediated redesign of metabolism and potentiation of anti-oxidant buffering.</a></h1><p>Accumulation of DNA lesions causing transcription stress is associated with natural and accelerated aging and culminates with profound metabolic alterations. Our understanding of the mechanisms governing metabolic redesign upon genomic instability, however, is highly rudimentary. Using Ercc1-defective mice and Xpg knock-out mice, we demonstrate that combined defects in transcription-coupled DNA repair (TCR) and in nucleotide excision repair (NER) directly affect bioenergetics due to declined transcription, leading to increased ATP levels. This in turn inhibits  allosterically and favors glucose rerouting through the pentose phosphate shunt, eventually enhancing production of NADPH-reducing equivalents. In NER/TCR-defective mutants, augmented NADPH is not counterbalanced by increased production of pro-oxidants and thus pentose phosphate potentiation culminates in an over-reduced redox state. Skin fibroblasts from the TCR disease Cockayne syndrome confirm results in animal models. Overall, these findings unravel a mechanism connecting DNA damage and transcriptional stress to metabolic redesign and protective antioxidant defenses.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31586055>Mitochondrial calcium exchange links metabolism with the epigenome to control cellular differentiation.</a></h1><p>Fibroblast to myofibroblast differentiation is crucial for the initial healing response but excessive myofibroblast activation leads to pathological fibrosis. Therefore, it is imperative to understand the mechanisms underlying myofibroblast formation. Here we report that mitochondrial calcium (Ca) signaling is a regulatory mechanism in myofibroblast differentiation and fibrosis. We demonstrate that fibrotic signaling alters gating of the mitochondrial calcium uniporter (mtCU) in a MICU1-dependent fashion to reduce Ca uptake and induce coordinated changes in metabolism, i.e., increased  feeding anabolic pathways and glutaminolysis yielding increased α-ketoglutarate (αKG) bioavailability. Ca-dependent metabolic reprogramming leads to the activation of αKG-dependent histone demethylases, enhancing chromatin accessibility in loci specific to the myofibroblast gene program, resulting in differentiation. Our results uncover an important role for the mtCU beyond metabolic regulation and cell death and demonstrate that Ca signaling regulates the epigenome to influence cellular differentiation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31617737>Prognostic utility of serial F-FDG-PET/CT in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer who underwent tri-modality treatment.</a></h1><p>This study explored the value of serial 18-fludeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (F-FDG-PET/CT) in predicting disease-free survival (DFS) in locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) treated with neoadjuvant chemoradiation (NCRT) and surgery.We prospectively studied 46 patients with LARC who underwent NCRT and surgery. F-FDG-PET/CT scans were performed at three time-points before surgery (pre-NCRT-PET1, during NCRT-PET2 and following completion of NCRT-PET3). The following semi-quantitative PET parameters were analysed at each time point: maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax), SUVmean, metabolic tumour volume (MTV) and tumour lesion  (TLG). Absolute and percentage changes in these parameters were analysed between time points. Statistical analysis consisted of median tests, Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier analysis for DFS.The median follow-up time was 24 months. A reduction in PET parameters showed statistically significant differences for patients with recurrence compared to those without; percentage changes in MTV between PET1 and PET3 (cut-off: 87%,  = 0.023), percentage changes in TLG between PET1 and PET3 (cut-off: 94%,  = 0.02) and absolute change in MTV PET1 and PET2 (cut-off: 10.25,  = 0.001).An absolute reduction in MTV between PET1 and PET3 (p=0.013), a percentage reduction in TLG between PET1 and PET2 (p=0.021), SUVmax and SUVmean at PET2 ( = 0.01,  = 0.027 respectively)were also prognostic indicators of recurrence.MTV percentage change between PET1 and PET2 and SUVmean percentage change between PET1 and PET3 were also trending towards significance ( = 0.052,  = 0.053 respectively).Serial F-FDG-PET/CT is a potentially reliable non-invasive method to predict recurrence in patients with LARC. Volumetric parameters were the best predictors.

Here we aimed to further explore differences in mtDNA variants between elite endurance and sprint athletes. For this purpose, we determined the rate of functional variants and the mutational load in mtDNA of Finnish athletes (n = 141) and controls (n = 77) and determined the sequence variation in haplogroups.The distribution of rare and common functional variants differed between endurance athletes, sprint athletes and the controls (p = 0.04) so that rare variants occurred at a higher frequency among endurance athletes. Furthermore, the ratio between rare and common functional variants in haplogroups J and K was 0.42 of that in the remaining haplogroups (p = 0.0005). The subjects with haplogroup J and K also showed a higher mean level of nonsynonymous mutational load attributed to common variants than subjects with the other haplogroups. Interestingly, two of the rare variants detected in the sprint athletes were the disease-causing mutations m.3243A > G in MT-TL1 and m.1555A > G in MT-RNR1.We propose that endurance athletes harbor an excess of rare mtDNA variants that may be beneficial for oxidative phosphorylation, while sprint athletes may tolerate deleterious mtDNA variants that have detrimental effect on oxidative phosphorylation system.

Protein deimination is an irreversible post-translational modification caused by the peptidylarginine deiminase (PAD) family of enzymes, which convert arginine into citrulline in target proteins. Protein deimination can cause structural and functional protein changes, facilitating protein moonlighting, but also leading to neo-epitope generation and effects on gene regulation. Furthermore, PADs have been found to regulate cellular release of extracellular vesicles (EVs), which are lipid-vesicles released from cells as part of cellular communication. EVs carry protein and genetic cargo and are indicative biomarkers that can be isolated from most body fluids. This study was aimed at profiling deiminated proteins in plasma and EVs of naked mole-rat. Key immune and metabolic proteins were identified to be post-translationally deiminated, with 65 proteins specific for plasma, while 42 proteins were identified to be deiminated in EVs only. Using protein-protein interaction network analysis, deiminated plasma proteins were found to belong to KEEG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) pathways of immunity, infection, cholesterol and drug metabolism, while deiminated proteins in EVs were also linked to KEEG pathways of HIF-1 signalling and . The mole-rat EV profiles showed a poly-dispersed population of 50-300 nm, similar to observations of human plasma. Furthermore, the EVs were assessed for three key microRNAs involved in cancer, inflammation and hypoxia.

Inhaled noxious gases, including cigarette smoke, are the major risk factor for COPD. Inhaled smoke first encounters the epithelial lining of the lungs, causing oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. We investigated whether a mitochondrial defect may contribute to increased lung epithelial pro-inflammatory responses, impaired epithelial repair and reduced corticosteroid sensitivity as observed in COPD. We used wild-type alveolar epithelial cells A549 and mitochondrial DNA-depleted A549 cells (A549 Rho-0) and studied pro-inflammatory responses using (multiplex) ELISA as well as epithelial barrier function and repair (real-time impedance measurements), in the presence and absence of the inhaled corticosteroid budesonide. We observed that A549 Rho-0 cells secrete higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines than wild-type A549 cells and display impaired repair upon wounding. Budesonide strongly suppressed the production of neutrophil attractant CXCL8, and promoted epithelial integrity in A549 wild-type cells, while A549 Rho-0 cells displayed reduced corticosteroid sensitivity compared to wild-type cells. The reduced corticosteroid responsiveness may be mediated by glycolytic reprogramming, specifically -associated PI3K signaling, as PI3K inhibitor LY294002 restored the sensitivity of CXCL8 secretion to corticosteroids in A549 Rho-0 cells. In conclusion, mitochondrial defects may lead to increased lung epithelial pro-inflammatory responses, reduced epithelial repair and reduced corticosteroid responsiveness in lung epithelium, thus potentially contributing to the pathogenesis of COPD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649264>ACTL6A regulates follicle-stimulating hormone-driven  in ovarian cancer cells via PGK1.</a></h1><p>Enhanced  has been identified as a hallmark of cancer. As a novel oncogene, ACTL6A is aberrantly amplified in several types of human cancers and has been shown to regulate tumor growth and progression. However, the roles of ACTL6A in the development of ovarian cancer and the regulation of cancer glucose metabolism are mostly unknown. Here we show that ACTL6A is overexpressed in ovarian cancers compared with adjacent non-tumor tissues, and that ACTL6A overexpression correlates with poor prognosis. Silencing of ACTL6A in vitro inhibits proliferation, clonal growth, and migration, and decreases glucose utilization, lactate production, and pyruvate levels of ovarian cancer cells. We found a positive correlation between ACTL6A and PGK1 expression in ovarian cancer tissues. Enforced ACTL6A expression increased PGK1 expression, whereas knockdown of ACTL6A had the opposite effect. Altered ACTL6A expression inhibits the tumorigenicity of ovarian cancer cells in vivo by downregulating PGK1. In addition, the expression of ACTL6A is regulated by follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) stimulation via PI3K/AKT pathway. Importantly, ACTL6A regulates FSH-enhanced  in ovarian cancer.

Metabolic parameters and clinicopathological factors from 176 consecutive patients with invasive lung adenocarcinoma between August 2008 and August 2016 who underwent F-FDG PET/CT examination were retrospectively analyzed. Invasive lung adenocarcinoma was divided into five pathological subtypes:lepidic predominant adenocarcinoma (LPA), acinar predominant adenocarcinoma (APA), papillary predominant adenocarcinoma (PPA), solid predominant adenocarcinoma (SPA), and micropapillary predominant adenocarcinoma (MPA). The differences in metabolic parameters [maximal standard uptake value (SUVmax), mean standard uptake value (SUVmean), total lesion  (TLG), and metabolic tumor volume (MTV)] and tumor diameter for different pathological subtypes were analyzed. Patients were divided into two groups according to their prognosis: good prognosis group (LPA, APA, PPA) and poor prognosis group (SPA, MPA). Logistic regression was used to filter predictors and construct a predictive model, and areas under the receiver operating curve (AUC) were calculated. Cox regression analysis was performed on prognostic factors.  82 (46.6%) females and 94 (53.4%) males of patients with invasive lung adenocarcinoma were enrolled in this study. Metabolic parameters and tumor diameter of different pathological subtype had statistically significant ( < 0.05). The predictive model constructed using independent predictors (Distant metastasis, Ki-67, and SUVmax) had good classification performance for both groups. The AUC for SUVmax was 0.694 and combined with clinicopathological factors were 0.745. Cox regression analysis revealed that Stage, TTF-1, MTV, and pathological subtype were independent risk factors for patient prognosis. The hazard ratio (HR) of the poor prognosis group was 1.948 (95% CI 1.042-3.641) times the good prognosis group.

In addition, KAT2A expression in PDAC specimens is correlated with 14-3-3ζ expression, and KAT2A regulates H3K79 succinylation in the promoter region of YWHAZ (encoding for 14-3-3ζ) to promote YWHAZ mRNA and 14-3-3ζ expression, thereby preventing β-catenin degradation. Expression of succinyltransferase activity-defective KAT2A Y645A reduces H3K79 succinylation and 14-3-3ζ expression, leading to decreased β-catenin stability and subsequently decreased expression of cyclin D1, c-Myc, GLUT1, and LDHA. KAT2A-mediated 14-3-3ζ and β-catenin expression promotes , cell proliferation, and migration and invasion of PDAC cells with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. These findings reveal a novel and instrumental role of KAT2A-mediated histone succinylation in regulation of gene expression and β-catenin stability to promote tumor cell proliferation and invasion.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Mitochondria are important mediators of metabolic flexibility and dysfunction is associated with metabolic inflexibility and pathology. Foodborne toxins are often overlooked as potential factors contributing to metabolic toxicity. Fusaric acid (FA), a neglected mycotoxin, is known to disrupt mitochondrial function. The aim of this study was to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying a metabolic switch in response to FA. This study investigated the effects of FA on energy homeostasis in cultured human liver (HepG2) cells. HepG2 cells poised to undergo oxidative and glycolytic metabolism were exposed to a range of FA concentrations (4, 63 and 250 µg/mL) for 6 hours. We determined mitochondrial toxicity, acetyl CoA levels and cell viability using luminometric, fluorometric and spectrophotometric methods. Expression of metabolic proteins (PDK1, PKM2, phosphorylated-PDH E1α and HIF-1α) and mRNAs (HIF-1α, PKM2, LDHa and PDK1) were determined using western blot and qPCR respectively. Our data connects a constitutive expression of HIF-1α in response to FA, to the inhibition of pyruvate decarboxylation through up-regulation of PDK-1 and phosphorylation of Pyruvate Dehydrogenase E1α subunit. Moreover, we highlight the potential of FA to induce a glucose "addiction" and phenotype reminiscent of the Warburg effect. The findings provide novel insights into the impact of this neglected foodborne mycotoxin in the dysregulation of energy metabolism.Copyright © 2019.

Neutrophils were traditionally considered transcriptionally inactive cells, but recent researches in the field led to a paradigm shift in neutrophil biology and revealed subpopulation heterogeneity, and functions pivotal to immunity and inflammation. Furthermore, recent unfolding of metabolic plasticity in neutrophils has challenged the long-standing concept of their sole dependence on glycolytic pathway. Metabolic adaptations and distinct regulations have been identified which are critical for neutrophil differentiation and functions. The metabolic reprogramming of neutrophils by inflammatory mediators or during pathologies such as sepsis, diabetes, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, glycogen storage diseases (GSDs), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis, and cancer are now being explored. In this review, we discuss recent developments in understanding of the metabolic regulation, that may provide clues for better management and newer therapeutic opportunities for neutrophil centric immuno-deficiencies and inflammatory disorders.Copyright © 2019 Kumar and Dikshit.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31624314>Roux-en-Y gastric bypass surgery restores insulin-mediated glucose partitioning and mitochondrial dynamics in primary myotubes from severely obese humans.</a></h1><p>Impaired insulin-mediated glucose partitioning is an intrinsic metabolic defect in skeletal muscle from severely obese humans (BMI ≥ 40 kg/m). Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery has been shown to improve glucose metabolism in severely obese humans. The purpose of the study was to determine the effects of RYGB surgery on glucose partitioning, mitochondrial network morphology, and the markers of mitochondrial dynamics skeletal muscle from severely obese humans.Human skeletal muscle cells were isolated from muscle biopsies obtained from RYGB patients (BMI = 48.0 ± 2.1, n = 7) prior to, 1 month and 7 months following surgery and lean control subjects (BMI = 22.4 ± 1.1, n = 7). Complete glucose oxidation, non-oxidized  rates, mitochondrial respiratory capacity, mitochondrial network morphology, and the regulatory proteins of mitochondrial dynamics were determined in differentiated human myotubes.Myotubes derived from severely obese humans exhibited enhanced glucose oxidation (13.5%; 95% CI [7.6, 19.4], P = 0.043) and reduced non-oxidized  (-1.3%; 95% CI [-11.1, 8.6]) in response to insulin stimulation at 7 months after RYGB when compared with the presurgery state (-0.6%; 95% CI [-5.2, 4.0] and 19.5%; 95% CI [4.0, 35.0], P = 0.006), and were not different from the lean controls (16.7%; 95% CI [11.8, 21.5] and 1.9%; 95% CI [-1.6, 5.4], respectively). Further, the number of fragmented mitochondria and Drp1(Ser) phosphorylation were trended to reduce/reduced (0.0104, 95% CI [0.0085, 0.0126], P = 0.091 and 0.0085, 95% CI [0.0068, 0.0102], P = 0.05) in myotubes derived from severely obese humans at 7 months after RYGB surgery in comparison with the presurgery state. Finally, Drp1(Ser) phosphorylation was negatively correlated with insulin-stimulated glucose oxidation (r = -0.49, P = 0.037).These data indicate that an intrinsic metabolic defect of glucose partitioning in skeletal muscle from severely obese humans is restored by RYGB surgery. The restoration of glucose partitioning may be regulated through reduced mitochondrial fission protein Drp1 phosphorylation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31578148>Associations of PGK1 promoter hypomethylation and PGK1-mediated PDHK1 phosphorylation with cancer stage and prognosis: a TCGA pan-cancer analysis.</a></h1><p>Cancer cells reprogram metabolism for proliferation. Phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (PGK1), as a glycolytic enzyme and newly identified protein kinase, coordinates  and mitochondrial metabolism. However, the clinical significance of PGK1 expression and function in cancer progression is unclear. Here, we investigated the relationship between the progression and prognosis of multiple cancer types and PGK1 expression and its function in the mitochondrial metabolism regulation.We performed pan-cancer analyses of PGK1 mRNA level and DNA methylation in 11,908 tumor tissues and 1582 paired normal tissues across 34 cancer types in The Cancer Genome Atlas datasets. Using specific antibodies against PGK1 S203 and PDHK1 T338 phosphorylation, we performed immunohistochemistry with tissue microarray assay in additional 818 cancer cases with 619 paired normal tissues from five cancer types.The PGK1 mRNA level was significantly elevated with hypomethylation in promotor regions and associated with advanced TNM stage in 15 and four cancer types, respectively. In breast carcinoma, elevated PGK1 mRNA level and promoter hypomethylation were associated with poor prognosis. Positively correlated PGK1 S203 and PDHK1 T338 phosphorylation levels were significantly associated with short overall survival (OS) in cancers of the breast, liver, lung, stomach, and esophagus and with advanced TNM stage in breast and esophageal cancers. PGK1 pS203 and PDHK1 pT338 were also independent predictors of short OS in liver, lung, and stomach cancer.The elevated expression, promoter hypomethylation, and phosphorylation of PGK1 and PDHK1 were related with disease progression and short OS in diverse types of cancer. PGK1 and PDHK1 phosphorylation may be potential prognostic biomarkers.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652719>Peroxiredoxin 6 Down-Regulation Induces Metabolic Remodeling and Cell Cycle Arrest in HepG2 Cells.</a></h1><p>Peroxiredoxin 6 (Prdx6) is the only member of 1-Cys subfamily of peroxiredoxins in human cells. It is the only Prdx acting on phospholipid hydroperoxides possessing two additional sites with phospholipase A2 (PLA2) and lysophosphatidylcholine-acyl transferase (LPCAT) activities. There are contrasting reports on the roles and mechanisms of multifunctional Prdx6 in several pathologies and on its sensitivity to, and influence on, the redox environment. We have down-regulated Prdx6 with specific siRNA in hepatoblastoma HepG2 cells to study its role in cell proliferation, redox homeostasis, and metabolic programming. Cell proliferation and cell number decreased while cell volume increased; import of glucose and nucleotide biosynthesis also diminished while polyamines, phospholipids, and most glycolipids increased. A proteomic quantitative analysis suggested changes in membrane arrangement and vesicle trafficking as well as redox changes in enzymes of carbon and glutathione metabolism, pentose-phosphate pathway, citrate cycle, fatty acid metabolism, biosynthesis of aminoacids, and /Gluconeogenesis. Specific redox changes in Hexokinase-2 (HK2), Prdx6, intracellular chloride ion channel-1 (CLIC1), PEP-carboxykinase-2 (PCK2), and 3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH) are compatible with the metabolic remodeling toward a predominant gluconeogenic flow from aminoacids with diversion at 3-phospohglycerate toward serine and other biosynthetic pathways thereon and with cell cycle arrest at G1/S transition.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31588287>Antimicrobial silver targets glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase in  of .</a></h1><p>Silver has long been used as an antibacterial agent, yet its molecular targets remain largely unknown. Using a custom-designed coupling of gel electrophoresis with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (GE-ICP-MS), we identified six silver-binding proteins in . The majority of the identified proteins are associated with the central carbon metabolism of . Among them, we unveil that GAPDH, an essential enzyme in , serves as a vital target of Ag in  for the first time. We demonstrate that silver inhibits the enzymatic function of GAPDH through targeting Cys149 in its catalytic site. The X-ray structure reveals that Ag coordinates to Cys149 and His176 with a quasi-linear geometry (S-Ag-N angle of 157°). And unexpectedly, two Ag ions coordinate to Cys288 in the non-catalytic site with weak argentophilic interaction (Ag···Ag distance of 2.9 Å). This is the first report on antimicrobial Ag targeting a key enzyme in the glycolytic pathway of . The findings expand our knowledge on the mode of action and bio-coordination chemistry of silver, particularly silver-targeting residues in proteins at the atomic level.This journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31635769>Non-FDG Radiopharmaceuticals in Head and Neck PET Imaging: Current Techniques and Future Directions.</a></h1><p>Positron emission tomography has become a standard in the staging of head and neck cancer as well as can be used in locating unknown primary malignancies, monitoring disease response, and identifying disease recurrence. Although 18F-fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose is by far the most frequently used radiopharmaceutical in head and neck imaging,  is not the only metabolic process or biochemical pathway that can be visualized. In addition, 18F-fluoro-2-deoxy-d-glucose positron emission tomography can be limited due to the nonspecific nature of alterations in glucose metabolism. In this review, we will cover multiple of the emerging radiotracers that have been applied clinically or are in development as promising tools to better image certain malignancies and delineate disease from treatment effects. The potential advantages and disadvantages of these radiopharmaceuticals will also be discussed.Copyright © 2019.

Progression towards RV failure is characterized by diastolic dysfunction, fibrosis and metabolic dysregulation. Metabolic modulation has been suggested as therapeutic option, yet, metabolic dysregulation may have various faces in different experimental models and disease severity. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we aimed to identify metabolic changes in the pressure loaded RV and formulate recommendations required to optimize translation between animal models and human disease. Methods and Results Medline and EMBASE were searched to identify original studies describing cardiac metabolic variables in the pressure loaded RV. We identified mostly rat-models, inducing pressure load by hypoxia, Sugen-hypoxia, monocrotaline (MCT), pulmonary artery banding (PAB) or strain (fawn hooded rats, FHR), and human studies. Meta-analysis revealed increased Hedges' g (effect size) of the gene expression of GLUT1 and HK1 and glycolytic flux. The expression of MCAD was uniformly decreased. Mitochondrial respiratory capacity and fatty acid uptake varied considerably between studies, yet there was a model effect in carbohydrate respiratory capacity in MCT-rats. Conclusions This systematic review and meta-analysis on metabolic remodeling in the pressure-loaded RV showed a consistent increase in glucose uptake and , strongly suggest a downregulation of beta-oxidation, and showed divergent and model-specific changes regarding fatty acid uptake and oxidative metabolism. To translate metabolic results from animal models to human disease, more extensive characterization, including function, and uniformity in methodology and studied variables, will be required.</p></html>
