Along with obesity, diabetes and insulin resistance, genetic factors strongly impact on NAFLD development and progression. Dysregulated bile   and the fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19) pathway play a pivotal role in NAFLD pathogenesis. However, it remains to be defined the mechanism through which the FGF19 receptor system is associated with liver damage in NAFLD.We evaluated the impact of the rs17618244 G>A β-Klotho (KLB) variant on liver damage in 249 pediatric patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD and the association of this variant with the expression of hepatic and soluble KLB. In vitro models were established to investigate the role of KLB mutant.The KLB rs17618244 variant was associated with increased risk of ballooning and lobular inflammation. KLB plasma levels were lower in carriers of the rs17618244 minor A allele and were associated with lobular inflammation, ballooning and fibrosis. In HepG2 and Huh7 hepatoma cell lines, exposure to free fatty  caused a severe reduction of intracellular and secreted KLB. Finally, KLB down-regulation obtained by the expression of KLB mutant in HepG2 and Huh7 cells induced intracellular  accumulation and up-regulation of p62, ACOX1, ACSL1, IL-1β and TNF-α gene expression.In conclusion, we showed an association between the rs17618244 KLB variant, which leads to reduced KLB expression, and the severity of NAFLD in pediatric patients. We can speculate that KLB protein may exert a protective role against lipotoxicity and inflammation in hepatocytes.Genetic and environmental factors strongly impact on NAFLD pathogenesis and progression. The FGF19/FGFR4/KLB pathway plays a pivotal role in NAFLD pathogenesis, thus, it has been identified as a therapeutic target. Therefore, the aim of the study was to investigate the impact of the KLB rs17618244 G>A genetic variant on liver damage severity in pediatric patients with NAFLD, and the effect of KLB mutant on hepatocellular damage.Copyright © 2019 European Association for the Study of the Liver.

They play three major roles: energy , structural, and signaling. They are dynamic molecules strongly influenced by endogenous and exogenous factors including genetics, diet, age, lifestyle, drugs, disease and inflammation. As precision medicine starts to become mainstream, there is a huge burgeoning interest in lipids and their potential to act as unique biomarkers or prognostic indicators. Lipids comprise a large component of all metabolites (around one-third), and our expanding knowledge about their dynamic behavior is fueling the hope that mapping their regulatory biochemical pathways on a systems level will revolutionize our ability to prevent, diagnose, and stratify major human diseases. Up to now, clinical  measurements have consisted primarily of total cholesterol or triglycerides, as a measure for cardiovascular risk and response to  lowering drugs. Nowadays, we are able to measure thousands of individual lipids that make up the lipidome. nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry (NMR) metabolomics is also being increasingly used in large cohort studies where it can report on total levels of selected  classes, and relative levels of fatty  saturation. To support the application of lipidomics research,  MAPS was established in 2003, and since then has gone on to become the go-to resource for several  databases,  drawing tools, data deposition, and more recently lipidomics informatics tools, and a  biochemistry encyclopedia, LipidWeb. Alongside this, the recently established Lipidomics Standards Initiative plays a key role in standardization of lipidomics methodologies.

Despite an increasing amount of people worldwide developing NAFLD and having it progress to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and potentially cirrhosis, there is still no approved therapy. Therefore, huge efforts are being made to find and develop a successful treatment. One of the special interests is understanding the liver-gut axis and especially the role of bile  in the progression of NAFLD. Farnesoid X receptor (FXR)-agonists have been approved und used in other liver diseases, such as primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) and primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC), and have shown signs of being able to decrease inflammation and potentially steatosis. This review will mainly focus on targets/ligands that play an important role in bile   and give an overview of ongoing clinical as well as pre-clinical trials. With the complexity of the issue, we did not aim at giving a complete review, rather highlighting important targets and potential treatments that could be approved for NAFLD/NASH treatment within the next few years.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661889>Combined Exposure to Fructose and Bisphenol A Exacerbates Abnormal  in Liver of Developmental Male Rats.</a></h1><p>The aim of this study was to investigate whether combined exposure to fructose and bisphenol A (BPA) has a synergistic effect on abnormal  in the liver of developmental male rats and its possible mechanism. Fifty weaned male Wistar rats were divided into five groups: the control, 13% fructose, 20% fructose, 1 µg/mL BPA, and 13% fructose + 1 µg/mL BPA (combined exposure). Rats were exposed to fructose and/or BPA through drinking water for eight weeks. Genes or proteins regulating  include sterol regulatory element binding protein 1 (SREBP1), adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), hormone sensitive lipase (HSL), acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (ACC1), fatty  synthase (FAS), zinc α 2 glycoprotein (ZAG) and estrogen receptor α (ERα), and the expression of proteins regulating inflammatory response, such as TLR4 and NF-κB, were determined. Serum total cholesterol (T-CHO), triglyceride (TG), low, high density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C, HDL-C), blood glucose, insulin, IL-17 and TNF-α levels were also measured. Liver tissue morphology was observed by H&E staining. The results showed that the levels of gene and protein catalyzing lipogenesis were increased (SREBP1, ACC1 and FAS), while those catalyzing lipolysis were decreased (ATGL, HSL and ZAG), accompanied by dyslipidemia, insulin resistance and hepatic  accumulation, and there were higher expression of TLR4 and NF-κB protein and lower expression of ERα protein in liver, and increased serum IL-17 and TNF-α levels in fructose and/or BPA exposed rats compared with controls. Moreover, the above indicators were more serious in combined exposure group than in single exposure group. Therefore, abnormal  in the liver of developmental rats could be exacerbated by combined exposed to fructose and BPA.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649645> subsp.  Releases Differentially Loaded Outer Membrane Vesicles Under Various Stress Conditions.</a></h1><p> is a Gram-negative, facultative intracellular bacterium, causing a severe disease called tularemia. It secretes unusually shaped nanotubular outer membrane vesicles (OMV) loaded with a number of virulence factors and immunoreactive proteins. In the present study, the vesicles were purified from a clinical isolate of subsp.  strain FSC200. We here provide a comprehensive proteomic characterization of OMV using a novel approach in which a comparison of OMV and membrane fraction is performed in order to find proteins selectively enriched in OMV vs. membrane. Only these proteins were further considered to be really involved in the OMV function and/or their exceptional structure. OMV were also isolated from bacteria cultured under various cultivation conditions simulating the diverse environments of  life cycle. These included conditions mimicking the milieu inside the mammalian host during inflammation: oxidative stress, low pH, and high temperature (42°C); and in contrast, low temperature (25°C). We observed several-fold increase in vesiculation rate and significant protein cargo changes for high temperature and low pH. Further proteomic characterization of stress-derived OMV gave us an insight how the bacterium responds to the hostile environment of a mammalian host through the release of differentially loaded OMV. Among the proteins preferentially and selectively packed into OMV during stressful cultivations, the previously described virulence factors connected to the unique intracellular trafficking of  were detected. Considerable changes were also observed in a number of proteins involved in the biosynthesis and  of the bacterial envelope components like O-antigen,  A, phospholipids, and fatty .

However, the critical mediators and the signal transductions are not well demonstrated. As ovipara, chicken represents a specific case in  that liver is the main site of  synthesis. The aim of this study is to elucidate the linkage of gut microbiota and  synthesis in broiler chickens. The broilers were subjected to dietary treatments of combined probiotics (: 4 × 10 cfu/kg; : 2 × 10 cfu/kg; : 2 × 10 cfu/kg; : 2 × 10 cfu/kg, PB) and guar gum (1 g/kg, GG), respectively. Results showed that dietary supplementation of PB and GG changed the cecal microbiota diversity, altered short chain fatty  (SCFAs) contents, and suppressed lipogenesis. In intestinal epithelial cells (IECs), SCFAs (acetate, propionate, and butyrate) up-regulated the expression of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) via mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways, mainly via the phospho - extracellular regulated protein kinase (ERK) and phospho-p38 mitogen activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) pathways. GLP-1 suppressed  accumulation in primary hepatocytes with the involvement of (AMP)-activated protein kinase/Acetyl CoA carboxylase (AMPK/ACC) signaling. In conclusion, the result suggests that SCFAs-induced GLP-1 secretion via MAPK pathway, which links the regulation of gut microbiota on hepatic lipogenesis in chickens.Copyright © 2019 Zhang, Sun, Zhao, Chen, Fan, Jiao, Zhao, Wang, Li, Li and Lin.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31625748>Metabolic Profiling and Compound-Class Identification Reveal Alterations in Serum Triglyceride Levels in Mice Immunized with Human Vaccine Adjuvant Alum.</a></h1><p>Alum has been widely used as an adjuvant for human vaccines; however, the impact of Alum on host  remains largely unknown. Herein, we applied mass spectrometry (MS) (liquid chromatography-MS)-based metabolic and  profiling to monitor the effects of the Alum adjuvant on mouse serum at 6, 24, 72, and 168 h post-vaccination. We propose a new strategy termed subclass identification and annotation for metabolomics for class-wise identification of untargeted metabolomics data generated from high-resolution MS. Using this approach, we identified and validated the levels of several lipids in mouse serum that were significantly altered following Alum administration. These lipids showed a biphasic response even 168 h after vaccination. The majority of the lipids were triglycerides (TAGs), where TAGs with long-chain unsaturated fatty  (FAs) decreased at 24 h and TAGs with short-chain FAs decreased at 168 h. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the impact of human vaccine adjuvant Alum on the host metabolome, which may provide new insights into the mechanism of action of Alum.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31632963>Monitoring the Sphingolipid  Synthesis by Stable-Isotope Labeling and Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry.</a></h1><p>Sphingolipids are a class of lipids that share a sphingoid base backbone. They exert various effects in eukaryotes, ranging from structural roles in plasma membranes to cellular signaling.  sphingolipid synthesis takes place in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where the condensation of the activated C fatty  palmitoyl-CoA and the amino  L-serine is catalyzed by serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT). The product, 3-ketosphinganine, is then converted into more complex sphingolipids by additional ER-bound enzymes, resulting in the formation of ceramides. Since sphingolipid homeostasis is crucial to numerous cellular functions, improved assessment of sphingolipid  will be key to better understanding several human diseases. To date, no assay exists capable of monitoring  synthesis sphingolipid in its entirety. Here, we have established a cell-free assay utilizing rat liver microsomes containing all the enzymes necessary for bottom-up synthesis of ceramides. Following  extraction, we were able to track the different intermediates of the sphingolipid  pathway, namely 3-ketosphinganine, sphinganine, dihydroceramide, and ceramide. This was achieved by chromatographic separation of sphingolipid metabolites followed by detection of their accurate mass and characteristic fragmentations through high-resolution mass spectrometry and tandem-mass spectrometry. We were able to distinguish, unequivocally, between  synthesized sphingolipids and intrinsic species, inevitably present in the microsome preparations, through the addition of stable isotope-labeled palmitate-d and L-serine-d. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a method monitoring the entirety of ER-associated sphingolipid biosynthesis. Proof-of-concept data was provided by modulating the levels of supplied cofactors (e.g., NADPH) or the addition of specific enzyme inhibitors (e.g., fumonisin B). The presented microsomal assay may serve as a useful tool for monitoring alterations in sphingolipid  synthesis in cells or tissues. Additionally, our methodology may be used for  studies of atypical substrates - naturally occurring or chemically tailored - as well as novel inhibitors of enzymes involved in sphingolipid  synthesis.Copyright © 2019 Wigger, Gulbins, Kleuser and Schumacher.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659873>Muscle Insulin Resistance in Youth with Obesity and Normoglycemia is Associated with Altered .</a></h1><p>This study aimed to phenotype and compare adipose, hepatic, and muscle insulin sensitivity (IS) in a diet- and physical activity-controlled cohort of normoglycemic youth with obesity with that of participants without obesity (controls) to distinguish early metabolic abnormalities in pediatric obesity.Thirty-eight participants (17 in the control group [BMI < 85th percentile] and 21 youth with obesity [BMI ≥ 95th percentile]; age: 12-21 years; 76% female; Tanner stage 4-5; sedentary) were enrolled. Tissue-specific IS was measured using a four-phase hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp with glucose and glycerol isotope tracers to assess suppression of endogenous glucose release and lipolysis by insulin. Intramyocellular  content was assessed by  H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and hepatic  fraction (HFF) and visceral  were assessed by magnetic resonance imaging. Calf-muscle mitochondrial activity was measured with exercise-stimulated  P-magnetic resonance spectroscopy.Youth with obesity had higher HFF (P < 0.001), visceral  (P = 0.024), and intramyocellular  content (P = 0.017) and lower muscle (glucose clearance rate [P < 0.001]), adipose (P < 0.0001), and hepatic IS (P < 0.003). Mitochondria postexercise response was not different. In participants with obesity, muscle IS inversely correlated with HFF (r = 0.700, P = 0.002) and suppressed free fatty  concentrations (r = -0.65, P = 0.003).Inactive normoglycemic youth with obesity had decreased muscle, adipose, and hepatic IS. Free fatty  and liver  were inversely associated with muscle IS, which argues for -targeted interventions.© 2019 The Obesity Society.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31596116>Delayed access to feed alters expression of genes associated with carbohydrate and amino  utilization in newly hatched broiler chicks.</a></h1><p>Newly hatched chicks must transition from -rich yolk to carbohydrate-rich feed as their primary nutrient source, and post-hatch delays in access to feed can have long-term negative consequences on growth and . In this study, impacts of delayed access to feed at hatch on expression of genes related to nutrient uptake and utilization in two metabolically important tissues, liver and muscle, were determined in broiler (meat-type) chickens. Hatched chicks were given access to feed within 3h (Fed) or delayed access to feed for 48h (Delayed Fed), and liver and breast muscle were collected from males at hatch and 4h, 1 day (D), 2D, 4D, and 8D post-hatch for analysis of gene expression. Differential expression of carbohydrate response element binding protein and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma in muscle and liver was observed, with results indicating a transitional delay from  to carbohydrate  when hatched chicks were not given immediate access to feed. Extended upregulation of insulin receptor mRNA was observed in both tissues in Delayed Fed birds, suggesting increased sensitivity to circulating levels of the hormone. Developmental delays in expression patterns of cationic amino  transporters 1 and 2 in both tissues and large neutral amino  transporter 1 in muscle were also apparent when immediate feed access was prevented. These data suggest that delayed transition to carbohydrate use and altered nutrient transport and utilization within liver and breast muscle are key factors negatively affecting growth and  following delayed feed access in broiler chickens.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31602526>Hepatic FATP5 expression is associated with histological progression and loss of hepatic  in NAFLD patients.</a></h1><p>Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) are characterized by the accumulation of excess hepatic . However, in the progression from NASH to cirrhosis, hepatic  is often lost. Our aim was to elucidate the mechanism underlying hepatic  loss during NASH progression.Liver biopsies were performed at The University of Tokyo Hospital between November 2011 and March 2016 on 146 patients with NAFLD and 14 patients with cryptogenic cirrhosis who were not being treated with any diabetes or dyslipidemia drugs. Among them, 70 patients underwent liver biopsy after an overnight fast, and 90 patients were biopsied 5 h after an oral glucose tolerance test. Expression differences in genes encoding several fatty  -related factors were examined and correlated with hepatic histological changes based on NAFLD activity scores. Prospective patient follow-up continued until June 2018.The level of fatty  transport protein 5 (FATP5), which is associated with free fatty  intake, was significantly and inversely correlated with features of histological progression, including ballooning and fibrosis. This was confirmed by immunohistochemical analysis. Transcript levels of genes encoding fatty  -related proteins were comparable between NASH with severe fibrosis and cryptogenic cirrhosis. Furthermore, a prospective cohort study demonstrated that low FATP5 expression was the most significant risk factor for hepatic  loss.Decreased hepatic FATP5 expression in NAFLD is linked to histological progression, and may be associated with hepatic  loss during NASH progression to cirrhosis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31609315>A Clinical Trial Assessing the Safety, Efficacy, and Delivery of Olive-Oil-Based Three-Chamber Bags for Parenteral Nutrition.</a></h1><p>Limited evidence exists to precisely estimate efficacy and safety differences between parenteral nutrition (PN) prepared using olive-oil-based three-chamber bags (3CBs) and soybean-oil-based compounded bags (CoBs) in hospitalized adult patients. We designed a multicenter, randomized, prospective, open-label, noninferiority protocol to compare the efficacy, safety, and distribution of olive-oil-based 3CBs and soybean-oil-based CoB formulations in adult Chinese patients requiring PN during surgical intervention. Subjects were randomized to receive either one of the study treatments using an interactive voice or web-based recognition system in accordance with the randomization code. Randomization was further stratified based on the study site and surgical category. Both treatment groups received similar amounts of calories and protein. In addition, the two study treatments contained a similar composition of the amino- component. The only difference between the two PN formulations was the  constitution. The duration of administration of study treatments was a minimum of 5 days up to a maximum of 14 days after the surgical procedure. The primary efficacy endpoint was serum prealbumin levels on day 5 of the study. Noninferiority was proved if the anti-log of the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval (CI) of the treatment difference was at least 0.80. Other efficacy measures included treatment preparation time; duration to achieve tolerability of oral nutrition; associated infectious complications; length of hospitalization; and laboratory assessment of markers of nutrition, inflammation, , and oxidative stress. A total of 458 patients were enrolled in the study. The results showed that olive-oil-based 3CBs were non-inferior to soybean-based CoBs, besides being well tolerated. The infection rate was found to be significantly lower in the olive-oil-based 3CB group. Thus, this study may be used as a reference for future research on  emulsion and 3CBs.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672943>TFEB activation in macrophages attenuates postmyocardial infarction ventricular dysfunction independently of ATG5-mediated autophagy.</a></h1><p>Lysosomes are at the epicenter of cellular processes critical for inflammasome activation in macrophages. Inflammasome activation and IL-1β secretion are implicated in myocardial infarction (MI) and resultant heart failure; however, little is known about how macrophage lysosomes regulate these processes. In mice subjected to cardiac ischemia/reperfusion (IR) injury and humans with ischemic cardiomyopathy, we observed evidence of lysosomal impairment in macrophages. Inducible macrophage-specific overexpression of transcription factor EB (TFEB), a master regulator of lysosome biogenesis (Mϕ-TFEB), attenuated postinfarction remodeling, decreased abundance of proinflammatory macrophages, and reduced levels of myocardial IL-1β compared with controls. Surprisingly, neither inflammasome suppression nor Mϕ-TFEB-mediated attenuation of postinfarction myocardial dysfunction required intact ATG5-dependent macroautophagy (hereafter termed "autophagy"). RNA-seq of flow-sorted macrophages postinfarction revealed that Mϕ-TFEB upregulated key targets involved in lysosomal . Specifically, inhibition of the TFEB target, lysosomal  lipase, in vivo abrogated the beneficial effect of Mϕ-TFEB on postinfarction ventricular function. Thus, TFEB reprograms macrophage lysosomal  to attenuate remodeling after IR, suggesting an alternative paradigm whereby lysosome function affects inflammation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31620022>Central Treatment of Ketone Body in Rainbow Trout Alters Liver  Without Apparently Altering the Regulation of Food Intake.</a></h1><p>We hypothesize that the presence in fish brain of a ketone body (KB) like β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) alters energy homeostasis through effects on food intake and peripheral energy . Using rainbow trout () as a model, we intracerebroventricularly (ICV) administered 1 μl 100 g body mass of saline solution alone (control) or containing 0.5 μmol of BHB. In a fist set of experiments, BHB did not affect food intake 6 and 24 h after treatment. In a second set of experiments, we evaluated 6 h after ICV BHB treatment changes in parameters putatively related to food intake control in brain areas (hypothalamus and hindbrain) involved in nutrient sensing and changes in energy  in liver. The absence of changes in food intake might relate to the absence of major changes in the cascade of events from the detection of KB through ketone-sensing mechanisms, changes in transcription factors, and changes in the mRNA abundance of neuropeptides regulating food intake. This response is different than that of mammals. In contrast, central administration of BHB induced changes in liver energy  suggesting a decreased use of glucose and probably an enhanced use of amino  and . These responses in liver are different to those of mammals under similar treatments but comparable to those occurring in fish under food deprivation conditions.Copyright © 2019 Comesaña, Velasco, Conde-Sieira, Otero-Rodiño, Míguez and Soengas.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31647087>Daily red wine vinegar ingestion for eight weeks improves glucose homeostasis and affects the metabolome but does not reduce adiposity in adults.</a></h1><p>Some studies have reported that vinegar ingestion at mealtime attenuates postprandial glycemia in healthy adults and individuals with type 2 diabetes. Emerging data suggest that chronic vinegar ingestion impacts  and reduces adiposity, although no study has yet corroborated the events of vinegar supplementation metabolically through a metabolomics approach. To examine the impact of daily vinegar ingestion on glucose homeostasis, adiposity, and the metabolome, an 8-week, randomized controlled trial design was implemented utilizing two parallel treatment arms: daily red wine vinegar ingestion and a control treatment. Participants were 45 healthy adults at increased risk for metabolic complications as determined by high waist circumferences. Measurements and blood samples were collected pre- and post-intervention. Central adiposity and visceral  were assessed by waist circumference and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, respectively. Plasma metabolites were analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (MS) and liquid chromatography-MS/MS. Analysis showed significant reductions in fasting glucose (p = 0.003) and insulin (p < 0.001). Insulin resistance was reduced 8.3% in the red wine vinegar group and increased 9.7% in the control group (p < 0.001). No significant between-group differences in body mass index, body weight, waist circumference, or visceral  were observed. Significant differences were observed in amino valerate and indole-3-acetic  (p < 0.05), with high magnitudes of fold change (>2) between groups. Metabolic pathway analysis revealed significant alterations in tryptophan . Although daily red wine vinegar ingestion for 8 weeks induced significant improvements in glucose homeostasis, our results indicate that daily red wine vinegar ingestion for 8 weeks is not associated with reductions in adiposity. This is the first study to investigate the effects of daily red wine vinegar supplementation using a metabolomics approach. Our results provide strong rationales for larger prospective studies to further clarify associations among obesity, chronic diseases, and functional foods such as vinegar using metabolomics.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31592400>Drug development research for novel adiponectin receptor-targeted antidiabetic drugs contributing to healthy longevity.</a></h1><p>It is well recognized that the decrease of adiponectin associated with high- diet and lack of exercise accounts for the onset of insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, the metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular disease. Our research efforts have led to the identification of adiponectin receptors, AdipoR1 and AdipoR2, with the former shown to activate AMP kinase in the liver and the latter shown to activate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α signaling thereby increasing fatty  oxidation. Again, adiponectin upregulates mitochondrial function in the skeletal muscle thereby improving glucose/ and insulin resistance. These findings suggested that activation of adiponectin/AdipoR signaling could represent a viable therapeutic approach to lifestyle-linked diseases associated with prevalent obesity thus contributing to healthy longevity in humans. Indeed, they have led to the successful discovery of AdipoRon, a small-molecule AdipoR-activating compound. Thus far, AdipoRon has been found not only to improve insulin resistance in mice but to prolong their lifespan shortened by high- diet. Additionally, our structure-based drug discovery research has led to AdipoR being identified as an entirely novel structure having a zinc iron bound within its seven-transmembrane domain as well as an opposite orientation to that of G protein-coupled receptors. It is expected that increasing insight into AdipoR signaling will facilitate the structure-based optimization of candidate small-molecule AdipoR-activating compounds for human use as well as the development of molecularly targeted and calorie-limiting/exercise-mimicking agents for lifestyle-linked diseases.© The Japan Diabetes Society 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31655859>Deletion of Voltage-Dependent Anion Channel 1 knocks mitochondria down triggering metabolic rewiring in yeast.</a></h1><p>The Voltage-Dependent Anion-selective Channel (VDAC) is the pore-forming protein of mitochondrial outer membrane, allowing metabolites and ions exchanges. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, inactivation of POR1, encoding VDAC1, produces defective growth in the presence of non-fermentable carbon source. Here, we characterized the whole-genome expression pattern of a VDAC1-null strain (Δpor1) by microarray analysis, discovering that the expression of mitochondrial genes was completely abolished, as consequence of the dramatic reduction of mtDNA. To overcome organelle dysfunction, Δpor1 cells do not activate the rescue signaling retrograde response, as ρ cells, and rather carry out complete metabolic rewiring. The TCA cycle works in a "branched" fashion, shunting intermediates towards mitochondrial pyruvate generation via malic enzyme, and the glycolysis-derived pyruvate is pushed towards cytosolic utilization by PDH bypass rather than the canonical mitochondrial uptake. Overall, Δpor1 cells enhance phospholipid biosynthesis, accumulate  droplets, increase vacuoles and cell size, overproduce and excrete inositol. Such unexpected re-arrangement of whole  suggests a regulatory role of VDAC1 in cell bioenergetics.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31614965>Comparative Transcriptome and Metabolic Profiling Analysis of Buckwheat ( (L.) Gaertn.) under Salinity Stress.</a></h1><p>Tartary buckwheat ( (L.) Gaertn.) is a nutritional crop, which has high flavonoid content. However, buckwheat is a salt sensitive glycophyte cereal crop and the growth and grain yield of buckwheat are significantly affected by soil salinity. In this study, we performed a comprehensive analysis of the transcriptome and metabolome of salt treated-buckwheat to understand the effects of salinity on buckwheat. A total of 50,681,938 clean reads were acquired from all samples. We acquired 94,950 unigenes with a mean length of 1133 bp and N50 length of 1900 bp assembly. Of these, 63,305 unigenes (66.7%) were matched in public databases. Comparison of the transcriptome expression patterns between control and salt treated groups showed that 4098 unigenes were up-regulated and 3292 unigenes were down-regulated significantly. Further, we found that genes involved with amino ,  and nucleotide  were most responsive to salt stress. Additionally, many genes involved in secondary metabolite biosynthesis changed significantly following treatment. Those affected included phenylpropanoid biosynthesis and flavonoid biosynthesis. Chromatographic analysis was used to examine the differences in concentration of flavonoids, carotenoids, amino  and organic  in the samples following treatment. There was a significant increase in rutin (12.115 mg/g dry weight), following salt stress; whereas, six carotenoids (lutein, zeaxanthin, 13Z--carotene, -carotene, E--carotene and 9Z--carotene) did not significantly respond to salt stress. Ultimately, our data acts as a valuable resource for future research on buckwheat and can be used as the basis for future analysis focused on gene-to-metabolite networks in buckwheat.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31645900>Mechanisms by which PE21, an extract from the white willow , delays chronological aging in budding yeast.</a></h1><p>We have recently found that PE21, an extract from the white willow , slows chronological aging and prolongs longevity of the yeast  more efficiently than any of the previously known pharmacological interventions. Here, we investigated mechanisms through which PE21 delays yeast chronological aging and extends yeast longevity. We show that PE21 causes a remodeling of  in chronologically aging yeast, thereby instigating changes in the concentrations of several  classes. We demonstrate that such changes in the cellular lipidome initiate three mechanisms of aging delay and longevity extension. The first mechanism through which PE21 slows aging and prolongs longevity consists in its ability to decrease the intracellular concentration of free fatty . This postpones an age-related onset of liponecrotic cell death promoted by excessive concentrations of free fatty . The second mechanism of aging delay and longevity extension by PE21 consists in its ability to decrease the concentrations of triacylglycerols and to increase the concentrations of glycerophospholipids within the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. This activates the unfolded protein response system in the endoplasmic reticulum, which then decelerates an age-related decline in protein and  homeostasis and slows down an aging-associated deterioration of cell resistance to stress. The third mechanisms underlying aging delay and longevity extension by PE21 consists in its ability to change  concentrations in the mitochondrial membranes. This alters certain catabolic and anabolic processes in mitochondria, thus amending the pattern of aging-associated changes in several key aspects of mitochondrial functionality.Copyright: © 2019 Medkour et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665391>A Combination of Metabolites Predicts Adherence to the Mediterranean Diet Pattern and Its Associations with Insulin Sensitivity and  Homeostasis in the General Population: The Fenland Study, United Kingdom.</a></h1><p>Cardiometabolic benefits of the Mediterranean diet have been recognized, but underlying mechanisms are not fully understood.We aimed to investigate how the Mediterranean diet could influence circulating metabolites and how the metabolites could mediate the associations of the diet with cardiometabolic risk factors.Among 10,806 participants (58.9% women, mean age = 48.4 y) in the Fenland Study (2004-2015) in the United Kingdom, we assessed dietary consumption with FFQs and conducted a targeted metabolomics assay for 175 plasma metabolites (acylcarnitines, amines, sphingolipids, and phospholipids). We examined cross-sectional associations of the Mediterranean diet score (MDS) and its major components with each metabolite, modeling multivariable-adjusted linear regression. We used the regression estimates to summarize metabolites associated with the MDS into a metabolite score as a marker of the diet. Subsequently, we assessed how much metabolite subclasses and the metabolite score would mediate the associations of the MDS with circulating lipids, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), and other metabolic factors by comparing regression estimates upon adjustment for the metabolites.Sixty-six metabolites were significantly associated with the MDS (P ≤ 0.003, corrected for false discovery rate) (Spearman correlations, r: -0.28 to +0.28). The metabolite score was moderately correlated with the MDS (r = 0.43). Of MDS components, consumption of nuts, cereals, and meats contributed to variations in acylcarnitines; fruits, to amino  and amines; and fish, to phospholipids. The metabolite score was estimated to explain 37.2% of the inverse association of the MDS with HOMA-IR (P for mediation < 0.05). The associations of the MDS with cardiometabolic factors were estimated to be mediated by acylcarnitines, sphingolipids, and phospholipids.Multiple metabolites relate to the Mediterranean diet in a healthy general British population and highlight the potential to identify a set of biomarkers for an overall diet. The associations may involve pathways of phospholipid , carnitine , and development of insulin resistance and dyslipidemia.Copyright © The Author(s) 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652267>Comparative characterization of bacterial communities in geese consuming of different proportions of ryegrass.</a></h1><p>Geese are extremely well-adapted to utilizing plant-derived roughage in their diet, so the grass must be added to commercial diets under intensive rearing systems. However, it is unclear whether the gut microbiota will change significantly when adding different proportions of ryegrass. In this study, 240 healthy male Yangzhou geese (28 days old) with similar body weights were randomly divided into four groups and fed different proportions grass (CK, whole commercial diets; EG1, ryegrass: commercial diets = 1.5:1; EG2, ryegrass: commercial diets = 2:1; EG3, ryegrass: commercial diets = 3:1) respectively. When the geese grew to 70 days old, their intestines were collected and high-throughput sequencing technology was performed to investigate the microbial diversity in the caecum of geese with different dietary supplements. There was no obvious change in the alpha diversity of gut microbiota of geese with ryegrass intake (P > 0.05) and the composition of dominant bacterium (including Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes) was also similar. However, the ratio between Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes was remarkably reduced with ryegrass intake (P < 0.05), and the relative abundance of 30 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) significantly differed. Additionally, the content of cellulose-degrading microbiota such as Ruminiclostridium and Ruminococcaceae UCG-010 were significantly increased in geese fed with increasing amounts of grass. Finally, the functional profiles of the goose gut microbiota were explored using the PICRUSt tool. Carbohydrate  and amino   were dominant metabolic pathways.  was significantly increased in EG3 compared that in the CK group (P < 0.05). Interestingly, Turicibacter and Parasutterella may have affected abdominal  deposition as grass intake increased. Taken together, although the diversity of bacterial communities was similar in geese fed with different proportions of ryegrass, cellulose-degrading microbiota (Ruminiclostridium and Ruminococcaceae UCG-010) were abundant and the  metabolic pathway was enriched, which may reduce abdominal  accumulation in high-ryegrass fed geese.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668688>Metabolomics of Aerobic Exercise in Chronic Stroke Survivors: A Pilot Study.</a></h1><p>Understanding the metabolic response to exercise may aid in optimizing stroke management. Therefore, the purpose of this pilot study was to evaluate plasma metabolomic profiles in chronic stroke survivors following aerobic exercise training.Participants (age: 62 ± 1 years, body mass index: 31 ± 1 kg/m, mean ± standard error of the mean) were randomized to 6 months of treadmill exercise (N = 17) or whole-body stretching (N = 8) with preintervention and postintervention measurement of aerobic capacity (VOpeak). Linear models for microarray data expression analysis was performed to determine metabolic changes over time, and Mummichog was used for pathway enrichment analysis following analysis of plasma samples by high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry.VOpeak change was greater following exercise than stretching (18.9% versus -.2%; P < .01). Pathway enrichment analysis of differentially expressed metabolites results showed significant enrichment in 4 pathways following treadmill exercise, 3 of which (heparan-, chondroitin-, keratan-sulfate degradation) involved connective tissue  and the fourth involve  signaling (linoleate ). More pathways were altered in pre and post comparisons of stretching, including branched-chain amino , tryptophan, tyrosine, and urea cycle, which could indicate loss of lean body mass.These preliminary data show different metabolic changes due to treadmill training and stretching in chronic stroke survivors and suggest that in addition to improved aerobic capacity, weight-bearing activity, like walking, could protect against loss of lean body mass. Future studies are needed to examine the relationship between changes in metabolomic profiles to reductions in cardiometabolic risk after treadmill rehabilitation.Published by Elsevier Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31597357>Comprehensive Multi-Omics Analysis Reveals Aberrant  of Epstein-Barr-Virus-Associated Gastric Carcinoma.</a></h1><p>The metabolic landscape of Epstein-Barr-virus-associated gastric cancer (EBVaGC) remains to be elucidated. In this study, we used transcriptomics, metabolomics, and lipidomics to comprehensively investigate aberrant  in EBVaGC. Specifically, we conducted gene expression analyses using microarray-based data from gastric adenocarcinoma epithelial cell lines and tissue samples from patients with clinically advanced gastric carcinoma. We also conducted complementary metabolomics and lipidomics using various mass spectrometry platforms. We found a significant downregulation of genes related to metabolic pathways, especially the  of amino , lipids, and carbohydrates. The effect of dysregulated metabolic genes was confirmed in a survival analysis of 3951 gastric cancer patients. We found 57 upregulated metabolites and 31 metabolites that were downregulated in EBVaGC compared with EBV-negative gastric cancer. Sixty-nine lipids, mainly ether-linked phospholipids and triacylglycerols, were downregulated, whereas 45 lipids, mainly phospholipids, were upregulated. In total, 15 metabolisms related to polar metabolites and 15 -associated pathways were involved in alteration of metabolites by EBV in gastric cancer. In this work, we have described the metabolic landscape of EBVaGC at the multi-omics level.

The thermotolerant methylotrophic yeast Ogataea thermomethanolica TBRC656 is a host for heterologous protein secretion. To understand the role of OtHac1 on the secretome of O. thermomethanolica, a comparative proteomic analysis using LC-MS/MS was employed to identify proteins with altered secretion levels when OtHac1 was mutated. 268 proteins were detected in the extracellular medium of O. thermomethanolica wild-type control and Othac1 mutant strains. A number of metabolic enzymes functioning in amino , carbohydrate, glycan, and  showed altered secretion in the mutant suggesting that OtHac1 may play a role in mediating extracellular . Most of the extracellular proteins identified do not contain canonical signal sequences suggesting that they are secreted via unconventional protein secretion pathways. Collectively, the data provide insights into protein secretion and OtHac1 function in O. thermomethanolica which will be useful for developing efficient host for protein production.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670366>Collaborative effects of chlorogenic  and caffeine on  via the AMPKα-LXRα/SREBP-1c pathway in high- diet-induced obese mice.</a></h1><p>To investigate the mechanism of the combined effects of chlorogenic  (CGA) and caffeine on  in high- diet-induced obese mice, eighty female ICR mice were randomly divided into eight groups and fed with a high- diet with/without CGA and/or caffeine for 14 weeks. The combination of CGA and caffeine effectively decreased body weight gain, intraperitoneal adipose tissue weight, serum LDL-c, FFA, TC, TG, leptin, IL-6 concentrations, and hepatic TG and TC levels and increased the serum adiponectin level. The CGA and caffeine combination also promoted the phosphorylation of AMPKα, inhibited the expressions of transcriptional regulators (SREBP-1c and LXRα), and decreased the expressions of FAS and HMGR. Besides, the expressions of ACO, ATGL and HSL were increased by the CGA and caffeine combinations. The results indicated that the combination of CGA and caffeine had anti-obesity effects and regulated  in high- diet-induced obese mice via the AMPKα-LXRα/SREBP-1c signaling pathway. Thus, chronic CGA and caffeine intakes may be potent for preventing obesity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31606596>Integration of lipidomic and transcriptomic profiles reveals novel genes and regulatory mechanisms of Schizochytrium sp. in response to salt stress.</a></h1><p>In this study, the effects of salt stress on the physiological, lipidomic and transcriptomic profiles of halophilic microalga Schizochytrium sp. were investigated. In general, Schizochytrium sp. could survive under high osmotic fermentation medium containing 30 g/L NaCl, and showed a significant increase in C14:0 percentage in total fatty . In lipidomic analysis, C14:0 was specifically enriched in phosphatidylcholine (PC), and membrane phospholipids participated in the salt stress response mostly. Specially, one novel signal  N-acylphosphatidylethanolamine (NAPE) (18:0/20:3/14:0) was upregulated significantly. Transcriptomic analysis revealed glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase (GPAT) and phospholipase ABHD3 (PLABDH3) were involved in C14:0  and NAPE biosynthesis. Signalling pathways they mediated were activated as evident by high expression level of Myristoyl-CoA: protein N-myristoyltransferase (NMT) and NAPE-hydrolyzing PLD (NAPE-PLD). This study gives us an insight in specific responses to salt stress in Schizochytrium sp. and provides a considerable proportion of novel genes that could commendably be used for engineering modification.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Novel disease biomarkers and curative treatment options are strongly needed.To apply untargeted metabolomic profiling to identify pathogenic mechanisms and candidate disease biomarkers in FA.Mass spectrometry-based untargeted metabolomic profiling was performed on serum samples of children with either FA alone, asthma alone or both FA and asthma as well as healthy pediatric controls.In this pilot study FA subjects exhibited a disease-specific metabolomic signature as compared to both control subjects and asthmatics. In particular, FA was uniquely associated with a marked decrease in sphingolipids, as well as a number of other  metabolites, in the face of normal frequencies of circulating natural killer T (NKT) cells. Specific comparison of FA and asthmatic subjects revealed differences in the microbiota-sensitive aromatic amino  and secondary bile  . Children with both FA and asthma exhibited a metabolomic profile that aligned with that of FA alone but not asthma. Among children with FA, history of severe systemic reactions and presence of multiple FA were associated with changes in tryptophan metabolites, eicosanoids, plasmalogens, and fatty .Children with FA display a disease-specific metabolomic profile that is informative of disease mechanisms and severity, and which dominates in the presence of asthma. Lower levels of sphingolipids and ceramides and other metabolomic alterations observed in FA children may reflect the interplay between an altered microbiota and immune cell subsets in the gut.Copyright © 2019.

Previous studies indicate that renin-angiotensin system (RAS) plays a complex role in NAFLD. As the only precursor of RAS, decreased angiotensinogen (AGT) profoundly impacts RAS bioactivity. Here we investigated the role of hepatocyte-derived AGT in liver steatosis. AGT floxed mice (hepAGT+/+) and hepatocyte-specific AGT deficient mice (hepAGT-/-) were fed on western diet and normal laboratory diet for 12 weeks, respectively. Compared with hepAGT+/+ mice, western diet-fed hepAGT-/- mice gained less body weight with improved insulin sensitivity. The attenuated severity of liver steatosis in hepAGT-/- mice was evidenced by histologic changes and reduced intrahepatic triglycerides. The abundance of SREBP1 and its down-stream molecules ACC, FASN was suppressed in hepAGT-/- mice. Furthermore, serum derived from hepAGT+/+ mice stimulated hepatocyte SREBP1 expression, which could be diminished by Akt/mTOR inhibition in vitro. Administration of losartan did not affect diet-induced body weight gain, liver steatosis severity, and hepatic p-Akt, p-mTOR, and SREBP1 protein abundance in hepAGT+/+ mice. These data suggest that attenuation of western diet-induced liver steatosis in hepAGT-/- mice is associated with the alternation of Akt/mTOR/SREBP-1c pathway.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31595424>Untargeted metabolomics reveals alterations in metabolites of  and immune pathways in the serum of rats after long-term oral administration of Amalaki rasayana.</a></h1><p>Amalaki rasayana, a traditional preparation, is widely used by Ayurvedic physicians for the treatment of inflammatory conditions, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer. Metabolic alterations induced by Amalaki rasayana intervention are unknown. We investigated the modulations in serum metabolomic profiles in Wistar rats following long-term oral administration of Amalaki rasayana. Global metabolic profiling was performed of the serum of rats administered with either Amalaki rasayana (AR) or ghee + honey (GH) for 18 months and control animals which were left untreated. Amalaki rasayana components were confirmed from AR extract using HR-LCMS analysis. Significant reductions in prostaglandin J2, 11-dehydrothromboxane B2, and higher levels of reduced glutathione and glycitein metabolites were observed in the serum of AR administered rats compared to the control groups. Eleven different metabolites classified as phospholipids, glycerophospholipids, glucoside derivatives, organic , and glycosphingolipid were exclusively observed in the AR administered rats. Pathway analysis suggests that altered metabolites in AR administered rats are those associated with different biochemical pathways of arachidonic  , fatty  , leukotriene , G-protein mediated events, phospholipid , and the immune system. Targeted metabolomics confirmed the presence of gallic , ellagic , and arachidonic  components in the AR extract. The known activities of these components can be correlated with the altered metabolic profile following long-term AR administration. AR also activates IGF1R-Akt-Foxo3 signaling axis in heart tissues of rats administered with AR.

Crude MCHM is an industrial chemical used as flotation reagent to clean coal. At the time of the spill, MCHM's toxicological data were limited, an issue that has been addressed by different studies focused on understanding the immediate and long-term effects of MCHM on human health and the environment. Using S. cerevisiae as a model organism we study the effect of acute exposure to crude MCHM on . Yeasts were treated with MCHM 550 ppm in YPD for 30 minutes. Polar and  metabolites were extracted from cells by a chloroform-methanol-water mixture. The extracts were then analyzed by direct injection ESI-MS and by GC-MS. The metabolomics analysis was complemented with flux balance analysis simulations done with genome-scale metabolic network models (GSMNM) of MCHM treated vs non-treated control. We integrated the effect of MCHM on yeast gene expression from RNA-Seq data within these GSMNM. A total of 215 and 73 metabolites were identified by the ESI-MS and GC-MS procedures, respectively. From these 26 and 23 relevant metabolites were selected from ESI-MS and GC-MS respectively, for 49 unique compounds. MCHM induced amino  accumulation, via its effects on amino  , as well as a potential impairment of ribosome biogenesis. MCHM affects phospholipid biosynthesis, with a potential impact on the biophysical properties of yeast cellular membranes. The FBA simulations were able to reproduce the deleterious effect of MCHM on cellular growth and suggest that the effect of MCHM on ubiquinol:ferricytochrome c reductase reaction, caused by the under-expression of CYT1 gene, could be the driven force behind the observed effect on yeast  and growth.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31659451>Anti-obesity effect of Lactobacillus rhamnosus LS-8 and Lactobacillus crustorum MN047 on high- and high-fructose diet mice base on inflammatory response alleviation and gut microbiota regulation.</a></h1><p>The objective of the study was to evaluate the anti-obesity effect of Lactobacillus rhamnosus LS-8 and Lactobacillus crustorum MN047, and illustrate the potential functional mechanism about the alleviation of high  and high fructose diet (HFFD) induced obesity and related metabolic abnormalities.C57BL/6J mice were subjected to a standard or HFFD with or without supplementation of L. rhamnosus LS-8 and L. crustorum MN047 for 10 weeks. Obesity related metabolic indices including glucose tolerance, insulin resistance, serum , liver function, hormones and inflammatory cytokines were assessed by standard protocols. For the monitoring of inflammatory response and , transcriptional levels were profiled in liver and/or adipose tissues. Furthermore, gut microbiota composition analyses in the fecal samples were performed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and gut microbial metabolites, including lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and short-chain fatty  (SCFAs), were also tested for the assessment of the relationship between gut microbiota variation and inflammatory response.Administration with L. rhamnosus LS-8 and L. crustorum MN047 significantly mitigated body weight gain and insulin resistance, and inflammatory response (TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-6 levels in serum and corresponding mRNA levels in adipose tissues) was significantly inhibited in these two strains-treated mice. Moreover, L. rhamnosus LS-8 and L. crustorum MN047 could partially normalized mRNA expression levels involved in  including Pparγ, Srebp-1c, CD36, Fabp2 and FAS. In addition, these two strains manipulated gut microbiota by decreasing the abundance of Bacteroides and Desulfovibrio and increasing that of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, which in turn raised the levels of feces SCFAs and lowered the levels of circulating LPS.These results indicated that L. rhamnosus LS-8 and L. crustorum MN047 supplementation possessed the anti-obesity effect on the HFFD fed mice by alleviating inflammatory response and regulating gut microbiota, which further suggested that these two probiotics can be considered as an alternative dietary supplement in combination with the preventive and therapeutic strategies against obesity and related complications.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658997>Inflammation triggers liver X receptor-dependent lipogenesis.</a></h1><p>Immune cell function can be modulated by changes in . Our studies indicate that cholesterol and fatty  synthesis increases in macrophages between 12 and 18 hours after the activation of toll-like receptors with pro-inflammatory stimuli and that up-regulation of lipogenesis may contribute to the resolution of inflammation. The inflammation-dependent increase in lipogenesis requires induction of the liver X receptors, members of the nuclear receptor superfamily of transcription factors, by type I interferons in response to inflammatory signals. Instead of the well-established role for liver X receptors in stimulating cholesterol efflux, we demonstrate that liver X receptors are necessary for the proper resumption of cholesterol synthesis in response to inflammatory signals. Thus, liver X receptors function as bidirectional regulators of cholesterol homeostasis driving efflux when cholesterol levels are high and facilitating synthesis in response to inflammatory signals. Liver X receptor activity is also required for the proper shutdown of a subset of type I interferon-stimulated genes as inflammation subsides, placing the receptors in a negative feedback loop that may contribute to resolution of the inflammatory response.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31639818>Linoleic  supplementation of cell culture media influences the phospholipid and  profiles of human reconstructed adipose tissue.</a></h1><p>Reconstructed human adipose tissues represent novel tools available to perform in vitro pharmaco-toxicological studies. We used adipose-derived human stromal/stem cells to reconstruct, using tissue engineering techniques, such an adipose tridimensional model. To determine to what extent the in vitro model is representative of its native counterpart, adipogenic differentiation, triglycerides accumulation and phospholipids profiles were analysed. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software revealed pathways enriched with differentially-expressed genes between native and reconstructed human adipose tissues. Interestingly, genes related to fatty   were downregulated in vitro, which could be explained in part by the insufficient amount of essential fatty  provided by the fetal calf serum used for the culture. Indeed, the  profile of the reconstructed human adipose tissues indicated a particular lack of linoleic , which could interfere with physiological cell processes such as membrane trafficking, signaling and inflammatory responses. Supplementation in the culture medium was able to influence the  profile of the reconstructed human adipose tissues. This study demonstrates the possibility to directly modulate the phospholipid profile of reconstructed human adipose tissues. This reinforces its use as a relevant physiological or pathological model for further pharmacological and metabolic studies of human adipose tissue functions.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31613798>Genetic deficiency or pharmacological inhibition of miR-33 protects from kidney fibrosis.</a></h1><p>Previous work has reported the important links between cellular bioenergetics and the development of chronic kidney disease, highlighting the potential for targeting metabolic functions to regulate disease progression. More recently, it has been shown that alterations in fatty  oxidation (FAO) can have an important impact on the progression of kidney disease. In this work, we demonstrate that loss of miR-33, an important regulator of , can prevent the repression of FAO in fibrotic kidneys and reduce  accumulation. These changes were associated with a dramatic reduction in the extent of fibrosis induced in two different mouse models of kidney disease. These effects were not related to changes in circulating leukocytes, as bone marrow transplant from miR-33 deficient animals did not have a similar impact on disease progression. Most importantly, targeted delivery of miR-33 peptide nucleic  (PNA) inhibitors to the kidney and other acidic microenvironments was accomplished using pH low insertion peptides (pHLIP) as a carrier. This was effective at both increasing the expression of factors involved in FAO and reducing the development of fibrosis. Together, these findings suggest that miR-33 may be an attractive therapeutic target for the treatment of chronic kidney disease.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31608569>Linking  transfer with reduced arbuscule formation in tomato roots colonized by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus under low pH stress.</a></h1><p>Arbuscules are the core structures of arbuscular mycorrhizae (AM), and arbuscule development is regulated by environmental stress, e.g., low pH. Recent studies indicate that  transfer from plants is essential for AM fungal colonization; however, the role of  transfer in arbuscule formation and the dynamics of  accumulation in arbuscules under low pH stress are far from well understood. In the symbiosis of tomato and Rhizophagus intraradices under contrasting pH conditions (pH 4.5 vs. pH 6.5), we investigated arbuscule formation, nutrient uptake, alkaline phosphatase activity and  accumulation; examined the gene expression involved in phosphate transport,  biosynthesis and transfer and sugar ; and visualized the  dynamics in arbuscules. Low pH greatly inhibited arbuscule formation, in parallel with reduced phospholipid fatty  accumulation in AM fungus and decreased P uptake. This reduction was supported by the decreased expression of plant genes encoding  biosynthesis and transfer. More degenerating arbuscules were observed under low pH conditions, and neutral  fatty  accumulated only in degenerating arbuscules. These data reveal that, under low pH stress, reduced  transfer from hosts to AM fungi is responsible for the inhibited arbuscule formation.© 2019 Society for Applied Microbiology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665961>Diabetes Mellitus Severity and a Switch From Using Lipoprotein Lipase to Adipose-Derived Fatty  Results in a Cardiac Metabolic Signature That Embraces Cell Death.</a></h1><p>Background Fatty  (FA) provision to the heart is from cardiomyocyte and adipose depots, plus lipoprotein lipase action. We tested how a graded reduction in insulin impacts the source of FA used by cardiomyocytes and the cardiac adaptations required to process these FA. Methods and Results Rats injected with 55 (D55) or 100 (D100) mg/kg streptozotocin were terminated after 4 days. Although D55 and D100 were equally hyperglycemic, D100 showed markedly lower pancreatic and plasma insulin and loss of lipoprotein lipase, which in D55 hearts had expanded. There was minimal change in plasma FA in D55. However, D100 exhibited a 2- to 3-fold increase in various saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated FA in the plasma. D100 demonstrated dramatic cardiac transcriptomic changes with 1574 genes differentially expressed compared with only 49 in D55. Augmented mitochondrial and peroxisomal β-oxidation in D100 was not matched by elevated tricarboxylic  or oxidative phosphorylation. With increasing FA, although control myocytes responded by augmenting basal respiration, this was minimized in D55 and reversed in D100. Metabolomic profiling identified significant  accumulation in D100 hearts, which also exhibited sizeable change in genes related to apoptosis and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick-end labeling-positive cells. Conclusions With increasing severity of diabetes mellitus, when the diabetic heart is unable to control its own FA supply using lipoprotein lipase, it undergoes dramatic reprogramming that is linked to handling of excess FA that arise from adipose tissue. This transition results in a cardiac metabolic signature that embraces mitochondrial FA overload, oxidative stress, triglyceride storage, and cell death.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654570>Fibroblast growth factor 21 protects against lipotoxicity-induced pancreatic β-cell dysfunction via regulation of AMPK signaling and .</a></h1><p>Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is known as a potent metabolic regulator but its protective mechanisms against lipotoxicity-induced β-cell dysfunction and apoptosis remain elusive. Here, we aimed to examine the regulatory pathways whereby FGF21 mediates islet  in lipotoxicity-treated cells and animal models. Rat β-cell line (INS-1E cells) and islets isolated from C57/BL6J mice were exposed to palmitic  (PA) with/without FGF21, mimicking lipotoxic conditions. Resultant insulin secretion and intracellular signaling were analyzed with Western blotting and RNA-seq. C57/BL6J and global FGF21 knockout (KO) mice were fed with a high- diet (HFD) to induce lipotoxicity and given with a long-acting mimetic of FGF21. Insulin resistance and β-cell function were then assessed using homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and insulinogenic index. FGF21 ameliorated PA-induced  accumulation, reversed cell apoptosis, and enhanced glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) as impaired by lipotoxicity in islet β-cells. Mechanistically, FGF21 exerted its beneficial effects through activation of AMPK-ACC (acetyl-CoA carboxylase) pathway and peroxisome proliferation-activated receptors (PPARs) δ/γ signaling, thus increasing the levels of carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1A (CPT1A) and leading to increased fatty  (FA) oxidation and reduced  deposition in β-cells. Interestingly, FGF21 reduced PA-induced cell death via restoration of the expression of apoptosis inhibitor Birc3. In vivo studies further showed that FGF21 is critical for islet insulinogenic capacity and normal function in the context of HFD-treated animals. FGF21 down-regulates islet cell  accumulation, probably via activation of AMPK-ACC and PPARδ/γ signaling, and reduces cell death under lipotoxicity, indicating that FGF21 is protective against lipotoxicity-induced β-cell dysfunction and apoptosis.© 2019 The Author(s).

Notably, factors such as excessive food consumption, a sedentary way of life, high sugar consumption, a -rich diet, and a certain genetic profile may lead to obesity. The present review brings together recent advances regarding the significance of interventions involving intestinal gut bacteria and host metabolic phenotypes. We assess important biological molecular mechanisms underlying the impact of gut microbiota on hosts including bile salt , short-chain fatty , and metabolic endotoxemia. Some previous studies have shown a link between microbiota and obesity, and associated disease reports have been documented. Thus, this review focuses on obesity and gut microbiota interactions and further develops the mechanism of the gut microbiome approach related to human obesity. Specifically, we highlight several alternative diet treatments including dietary changes and supplementation with probiotics. The future direction or comparative significance of fecal transplantation, synbiotics, and metabolomics as an approach to the modulation of intestinal microbes is also discussed.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657086>PRRX1-induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in salivary adenoid cystic carcinoma activates the metabolic reprogramming of free fatty  to promote invasion and metastasis.</a></h1><p>Increasing evidences demonstrate a close correlation between epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) induction and cancer . However, the molecular mechanisms have not been clarified.In our study, the relative expression level of PRRX1 was detected, its relationship with free fatty  (FFA) and PPARG2 was analysed in 85 SACC tissues and 15 salivary glands from the benign salivary tumours. We also compared the FFAs composition and levels in these SACC cells. PPARG2 was detected in PRRX1-induced FFAs treatment as well as Src and MMP-9 were detected in FFAs treatment-induced invasion and migration of SACC cells, and ChIP test was performed to identify the target interactions.Our data showed that overexpression of PRRX1 induced EMT and facilitated the invasion and migration of SACC cells, and PRRX1 expression was closely associated with high FFAs level and poor prognosis of SACC patients. Furthermore, PRRX1 silence led to the increase of PPARG2 and the reduction of FFAs level and the migration and invasion of SACC cells. And inhibition of PPARG2 rescued FFAs level and migration and invasion capabilities of SACC cells. Free fatty  treatment induced an increase of Stat5-DNA binding activity via Src- and MMP-9-dependent pathway.Collectively, our findings showed that the PRRX1/PPARG2/FFAs signalling in SACC was important for accelerating tumour metastasis through the induction of EMT and the metabolic reprogramming of FFAs.© 2019 The Authors.

FXR plays critical roles in other  metabolic pathways, including  oxidation; however, little is known about cafestol's effects on fatty  . Thus, the goal was to investigate cafestol's effects on fatty   using Caenorhabditis elegans. Cafestol at 60 µM reduced  accumulation and increased locomotor activity (an indicator of energy expenditure) by 20% and 38%, respectively, compared to the control. Cafestol's effects were dependent on daf-12 (a functional homolog of the human FXR) with upregulation of ech-1.1 (a homolog of enoyl-CoA hydratase involved in fatty  β-oxidation) and tub-1 (an ortholog of the human TUBBY involved in the neurological regulation of energy expenditure) without any effects on lipogenesis, lipolysis or  uptake and transport. Therefore, cafestol increased  oxidation and energy expenditure via DAF-12-dependent pathway in C. elegans.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, we aimed to explore whether inhibition of ceramide signaling by myriocin is beneficial in animal model of NAFLD via regulating autophagy.Sprague Dawley rats were randomly divided into three groups: standard chow (n = 10), high- diet (HFD) (n = 10) or HFD combined with oral administration of myriocin (0.3 mg/kg on alternate days for 8 weeks) (n = 10). Liver histology and autophagy function were measured. HepG2 cells were incubated with fatty  with or without myriocin treatment.  accumulation and autophagy markers in the HepG2 cells were analyzed. Serum ceramide changes were studied in 104 subjects consisting healthy adults, liver biopsy-proven patients with NAFLD and liver biopsy-proven patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB).Myriocin reversed the elevated body weight and serum transaminases and alleviated dyslipidemia in HFD fed rats. Myriocin treatment significantly attenuated liver pathology including steatosis, lobular inflammation and ballooning. By qPCR analysis, it was revealed that myriocin corrected the expression pattern of fatty   associated genes including Fabp1, Pparα, Cpt-1α and Acox-2. Further, myriocin also restored the impaired hepatic autophagy function in rats with HFD-induced NASH, and this has been verified in HepG2 cells. Among the sphingolipid species that we screened in lipidomic profiles, significantly increased ceramide was observed in NASH patients as compared to the controls and non-NASH patients, regardless of whether or not they have active CHB.Ceramide may play an important regulatory role in the autophagy function in the pathogenesis of NASH. Hence, blockade of ceramide signaling by myriocin may be of therapeutically beneficial in NASH.Registration ID: ChiCTR-DDT-13003983 .

The effect of FO on bone health is controversial. This study aims to evaluate the effect of FO on bone damage induced by a high- diet (HFD) and to explore the possible mechanism.Male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed a normal control diet (NC, 10% ), FO diet (NY, 10% ), HFD (60% ), or HFD containing 10% FO (HY, 60% ) for 22 weeks. Micro CT and three-point bending tests were conducted to evaluate bone microstructure and biomechanics. Serum was collected for the detection of ALP, P1NP, and CTX-1. Rat primary osteoblasts (OBs) were treated with different concentrations of ALA with or without palmitic  (PA) treatment. The ALP activity, osteogenic-related gene and protein expression were measured.Rats in the HFD group displayed decreased biomechanical properties, such as maximum load, maximum fracture load, ultimate tensile strength, stiffness, energy absorption, and elastic modulus, compared with the NC group (   < 0.05). However, HY attenuated the HFD-induced decreases in bone biomechanical properties, including maximum load, maximum fracture load, and ultimate tensile strength ( < 0.05). Trabecular bone markers such as trabecular volume bone mineral density (Tb. vBMD trabecular bone volume/total volume (Tb. BV/TV), trabecular number (Tb. N), trabecular thickness (Tb. Th) were decreased, trabecular separation (Tb. Sp) and the structure model index (SMI) were increased in the HFD group compared with the NC group, and all parameters were remarkably improved in the HY group compared to the HFD group (p < 0.05). However, cortical bone markers such as cortical volume bone mineral density (Ct. vBMD), cortical bone volume/total volume (Ct. BV/TV) and cortical bone thickness (Ct. Th) were not significantly different among all groups. Moreover, the serum bone formation markers ALP and P1NP were higher and the bone resorption marker CTX-1 was lower in the HY group compared with levels in the HFD group. Compared with the NC group, the NY group had no difference in the above indicators. In rat primary OBs, PA treatment significantly decreased ALP activity and osteogenic gene and protein (β-catenin, RUNX2, and osterix) expression, and ALA dose-dependently restored the inhibition induced by PA.FO might be a potential therapeutic agent for HFD-induced bone loss, most likely by promoting osteogenesis.© The Author(s). 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31600492>Geniposide against atherosclerosis by inhibiting the formation of foam cell and lowering reverse  transport via p38/MAPK signaling pathways.</a></h1><p>Geniposide, the main medicinal ingredient of Gardenia jasminoides Ellis, is known to be a resistant agent to atherosclerosis. Some reports its mechanism against atherosclerosis remains completely unclear. Herein, we have investigated the protective effect of geniposide against atherosclerosis as well as clarified the mechanisms related with inhibiting the formation of foam cells and lowering reverse  transport via p38/MAPK signaling pathways. Macrophage Raw264.7 was induced by lysophosphatidic  (LPA) to form foam cell as a cell model. ApoE mice were fed with a high- diet for 16 weeks to cause atherosclerosis in carotid artery. After treatment with geniposide, CCK-8, oil red O stain, qRT-PCR and western blot were carried out to explore the effect of geniposide. Morphological changes, histological analyses were used to evaluate atherosclerosis in ApoE mice. Geniposide significantly reduced serum total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG) and LDL cholesterol levels in ApoE mice compared with vehicle control. Meanwhile, geniposide dose dependently inhibited the development of atherosclerosis in ApoE mice. Furthermore, geniposide observably inhibited the formation of foam cells induced by LPA, down-regulated the mRNA and protein levels of SR-A and up-regulated the mRNA and protein levels of ABCA1 or SR-B1 in vitro via inhibition of the p38MAPK and AKT signaling pathways. Our study shows that geniposide protected against atherosclerosis and inhibited the formation of foam cells by regulating the equilibrium on expression of diverse  transporters in cytomembrane which related with p38MAPK and AKT signaling pathways. Geniposide is a potential therapeutic drug for atherosclerosis.Copyright © 2019.

Although the mechanisms involved are likely complex, these associations suggest that lowering circulating ceramide levels could be protective against cardiovascular diseases. Conversely, dietary fibers, such as inulin, have been reported to promote cardiovascular and metabolic health. However, the mechanisms involved in these protective processes also are not well understood. We studied the effects of inulin on  with a model of atherosclerosis in LDL receptor-deficient mice using lipidomics and transcriptomics. Plasma and tissues were collected at 10 days and/or 12 weeks after feeding mice an atherogenic diet supplemented with inulin or cellulose (control). Compared with controls, inulin-fed mice displayed a decreased C16:0/C24:0 plasma ceramide ratio and lower levels of circulating ceramides associated with VLDL and LDL. Liver transcriptomic analysis revealed that Smpd3, a gene that encodes neutral sphingomyelinase (NSMase), was downregulated by 2-fold in inulin-fed mice. Hepatic NSMase activity was 3-fold lower in inulin-fed mice than in controls. Furthermore, liver redox status and compositions of phosphatidylserine and free fatty  species, the major factors that determine NSMase activity, also were modified by inulin. Taken together, these results showed that, in mice, inulin can decrease plasma ceramide levels through reductions in NSMase expression and activity, suggesting a mechanism by which fiber could reduce cardiometabolic disease risk.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31610126>Reduction of Hepatic Lipogenesis by Loliolide and Pinoresinol from  via Degrading Liver X Receptors.</a></h1><p>The liver X receptors (LXRs) are major regulators of lipogenesis, and their reduced activation by an inhibitor could be a treatment strategy for fatty liver disease. Small molecules originating from dietary food are considered suitable and attractive drug candidates for humans in terms of safety. In this study, an edible plant,  (LV), used as a traditional and medicinal food in East Asia was evaluated for lipogenesis decreasing effects. Activity-guided fractionation was performed, and the isolated compounds were identified using spectroscopic methods. We conducted in vitro real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and Western blotting as well as histological and biochemical analyses following in vivo treatments. Using a high- diet animal model, we confirmed that LV extracts (LVE) decreased lipogenic  and restored liver function to control levels. To identify active components, we conducted activity-guided fractionation and then isolated compounds. Two compounds, loliolide and pinoresinol, were identified in the dichloromethane fraction, and they significantly attenuated the expression levels of lipogenic factors including sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP)-1, stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 (SCD1), fatty  synthase (FAS), and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC). Importantly, loliolide and pinoresinol significantly accelerated the protein degradation of LXRs by enhanced ubiquitination, which inhibited lipogenesis.

In the present experiment, we study the function of acetate (a major SCFA in the rabbit gut) on . Ninety rabbits (40 days of age) were randomly divided into three groups: a sham control group (injection of saline for four days); a group experiencing subcutaneous injection of acetate for four days (2 g/kg BM per day, one injection each day, acetate); and a pair-fed sham treatment group. The results show that acetate-inhibited  accumulation by promoting lipolysis and fatty  oxidation and inhibiting fatty  synthesis. Activated G protein-coupled receptor 41/43, adenosine monophosphate activated protein kinase (AMPK) and extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 signal pathways were likely to participate in the regulation in  accumulation of acetate. Acetate reduced hepatic triglyceride content by inhibiting fatty  synthesis, enhancing fatty  oxidation and  output. Inhibited peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α () and activated AMPK and ERK1/2 signal pathways were related to the process in liver. Acetate reduced intramuscular triglyceride level via increasing fatty  uptake and fatty  oxidation. PPARα was associated with the acetate-reduced intracellular  content.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31675219>Hepatic metabolomic and transcriptomic responses induced by cecal infusion of sodium propionate in a fistula pig model.</a></h1><p>Short-chain fatty  (SCFAs) are the major products of the microbial fermentation of indigestible carbohydrates. SCFAs are known to improve host  but their underlying mechanism of action remains elusive. In this study, sixteen growing pigs were infused with saline or sodium propionate solution (25 mL, 2 mol/L), respectively through a cecal fistula twice a day during a 28 days experimental period. The results showed that the cecal infusion of the SCFA propionate decreased serum and liver triglyceride levels, and increased serum PYY secretion in growing pigs. Hepatic metabolomics identified 12 metabolites that were significantly altered by propionate. These included decreased levels of  related stearic  and glycerol-2-phosphate; increased levels of TCA cycle components including malic , fructose-6-phosphate, and succinic ; and decreased levels of the amino   products aspartic  and serine. Hepatic transcriptomics demonstrated that propionate inhibited fatty  synthesis and promoted  metabolic process. Pathway enrichment analysis showed that propionate accelerated gluconeogenesis and decreased glycolysis.

Liver tissues were sampled at 0-48 hr after PHX and  accumulation, fatty  translocase (/CD36), sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP1c), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα), proliferative cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and ERα were examined by Oil Red O, qRT-PCR and immunohistochemistry, respectively. Hepatic  accumulation was abundant in female and OVX-E compared to male and OVX rats. /CD36 expression was observed in female, OVX and OVX-E at 0-12 hr after PHX, but not in male rats. At 0 hr, SREBP1c and PPARα were elevated in female and male rats, respectively, but were decreased after PHX in all rats. The PCNA labeling index reached a maximum at 36 hr and 48 hr in OVX-E and OVX rats, respectively. ERα expression in OVX-E was higher than OVX at 0-36 hr after PHX. In conclusion, these results indicated that estrogen and ERα might play an important role in  accumulation related to /CD36 during early phase of rat liver regeneration.2019 The Japan Society of Histochemistry and Cytochemistry.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31646566>STAT5A reprograms fatty   and promotes tumorigenesis of gastric cancer cells.</a></h1><p>The aim of this study was to determine the underlying effect of STAT5A-mediated fatty   on the tumorigenesis of gastric cancer cells.The expression patterns of STAT5A and FASN in gastric cancer were investigated based on the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database and compared between 40 pairs of cancer samples and adjacent tissues. The pathological significance of STAT5A in gastric cancer was explored by GESA assay, and the molecular mechanism of STAT5A-mediated FASN expression was investigated by Luciferase assay and ChIP-qPCR. Fatty  metabolic change was explored by detecting the content of neutral , triglycerides, and phospholipids in STAT5A silenced MKN28 and AGS cells. Furthermore, Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay, colony formation, and Mouse xenograft were used to detect the function of STAT5A-mediated fatty   on tumorigenic ability of gastric cancer cells.Upregulated STAT5A in gastric cancer was found to be not only an unconventional risk for over survival of gastric cancer patients, but also associated with fatty   signaling. Furthermore, STAT5A can regulate the expression of the fatty  binding protein 5 (FABP5) by binding to the promoter of FABP5 in MKN28 and AGS cells.

Currently, our understanding of sublethal effects and underlying toxicologic mechanisms of GBHs are still limited, especially in amphibians. Here, the sublethal effects of a commercial GBH (KISSUN®) on tadpoles of a farmland dwelling frog, Microhyla fissipes, were investigated. The 10-d LC of "KISSUN®" GBH was 77.5 mg/L. Tadpoles exposed to 60-120 mg/L showed increased preference to higher temperature. After 10 days exposure, obvious growth suppression was observed in survived GBH-stressed tadpoles, characterized by dosage depended decrement in body mass, body width, total length, etc. GBH-stressed tadpoles also showed decreased tail length/snout-vent length ratio and smaller tail muscle fiber diameter. Comparative transcriptomics (control, 60 mg/L and 90 mg/L groups) was conducted to analyze the underlying molecular processes. GBH-stressed tadpoles showed downregulated transcription of ribosomal proteins and cytoskeleton proteins, which could explain their suppressed whole body and tail muscle growth. Moreover, GBH-stressed tadpoles showed transcriptional downregulation of carbohydrate and  catabolism, but upregulation of amino  catabolism. It suggested a metabolic switch from carbohydrate and  to amino  in these tadpoles. Accordingly, there was a trade-off between protein synthesis and energy production in respect to amino  allocation, and it provided a metabolic explanation for why protein synthesis was downregulated and growth was suppressed in GBH-stressed tadpoles. In combination with existing literatures, we speculated that GBH might directly target the enzymes in carbohydrate and  catabolism, and this metabolic effect of GBH might be common to fish and amphibians. In conclusion, our study provided a systematic insight into the sublethal symptoms of GBH-stressed tadpoles, and a metabolic switch from carbohydrate and  to amino  likely underlay some common toxic symptoms of GBHs on both fish and tadpoles.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

We hypothesize that this occurs via vitamin E-activation of pregnane X receptor (PXR) mediated pathways involved in bile  . Neonatal piglets received PN for 14 d containing Intralipid (IL, soy-based  emulsion), IL supplemented with 12.6 mg/kg*d vitamin E (VITE), or IL with 10 mg/kg*d Rifadin IV (RIF) a PXR agonist. Pigs treated with IL and VITE, but not RIF, developed cholestasis and hyperbilirubinemia, markers of liver disease. The hepatic PXR target genes CYP3A29 and UGT1A6 increased during RIF treatment.

Serum fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-19, a key regulator in suppressing hepatic bile  synthesis significantly increased in the RIF group.

The growth status of abdominal  during postnatal late development ultimately affects meat yield and quality in chickens. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous small noncoding RNAs that regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. Studies have shown that miRNAs play an important role in the biological processes involved in adipose tissue development. However, few studies have investigated miRNA expression profiles and their interaction networks associated with the postnatal late development of abdominal adipose tissue in chickens.We constructed four small RNA libraries from abdominal adipose tissue obtained from Chinese domestic Gushi chickens at 6, 14, 22, and 30 weeks. A total of 507 known miRNAs and 53 novel miRNAs were identified based on the four small RNA libraries. Fifty-one significant differentially expressed (SDE) miRNAs were identified from six combinations by comparative analysis, and the expression patterns of these SDE miRNAs were divided into six subclusters by cluster analysis. Gene ontology enrichment analysis showed that the SDE miRNAs were primarily involved in the regulation of  cell differentiation, regulation of , regulation of fatty  , and unsaturated fatty   in the - or deposition-related biological process categories. In addition, we constructed differentially expressed miRNA-mRNA interaction networks related to abdominal adipose development. The results showed that miRNA families, such as mir-30, mir-34, mir-199, mir-8, and mir-146, may have key roles in , adipocyte proliferation and differentiation, and cell junctions during abdominal adipose tissue development in chickens.This study determined the dynamic miRNA transcriptome and characterized the miRNA-mRNA interaction networks in Gushi chicken abdominal adipose tissue for the first time.

EETs elicit endothelial angiogenic activity linked to tumor growth in various cancer models that can be attenuated in vivo by COX-2 inhibitors. This study further defines the relationship between endothelial EET  and COX-2 in promoting angiogenesis. Using human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs), we quantified 8,9-EET-induced tube formation and cell migration as indicators of angiogenic potential, in the presence and absence of a COX-2 inducer (PDBu). Although PDBu itself was potent in increasing angiogenic markers, 8,9-EET in combination with PDBu elicited a 1.3-fold larger response than 8,9-EET alone, and compared to PDBu. Contributing to this response were 8,9-EET metabolites formed from COX-2, the 11-hydroxy-8,9-EET (8,9,11-EHET) and 15-hydroxy-8,9-EET (8,9,15-EHET). When exogenously dosed into HAEC, synthetic 8,9,11-EHET enhanced angiogenesis at all concentrations tested, whereas 8,9,15-EHET was inactive. Tube formation by 8,9,11-EHET was independent of PI3K-Akt, p38 MAPK, and MEK signaling. These results indicate that 8,9-EET-stimulated angiogenesis is enhanced by COX-2  in endothelium through formation of 8,9,11-EHET. This  mediator may play a role in regulating physiological angiogenesis, and it may be especially important under circumstances where COX-2 is induced, such as in cancer tumor growth and inflammation. Finally, the generation of 8, 9, 11-EHET from 8, 9-EET may help explain why EETs are weakly angiogenic under some conditions yet block tumor growth under other conditions.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31609072>Avocatin B Protects Against Lipotoxicity and Improves Insulin Sensitivity in Diet-Induced Obesity.</a></h1><p>The effects of an avocado-derived fatty  oxidation (FAO) inhibitor, avocatin B (AvoB), on glucose and  in models of diet-induced obesity (DIO) and in vitro models of lipotoxicity are evaluated.

The greatest differences were found after parturition with 281 DEG (179 upregulated and 102 downregulated). The activated pathways were mainly related to immunity and endocrine aspects, while metabolic pathways related to  and amino   were inhibited. Plasma BHBA had a substantial inhibitory impact on KEGG pathways related to DNA replication and cell cycle, while plasma IL-1β had an inhibitory impact on fatty  elongation in mitochondria and an activated impact in several pathways related to cellular energy .

Mice with impaired macrophage activation, when fed a high- diet, develop severe NASH. Evidence is mounting that Kupffer cells are implicated. However, it is unknown whether the resident CD68 or bone marrow-derived CD11b Kupffer cells are involved. Characterization of the FSP1cre-Pparb/d mouse liver revealed that FSP1 is expressed in CD11b Kupffer cells. Although these cells only constitute a minute fraction of the liver cell population,  deletion in these cells led to remarkable hepatic phenotypic changes. We report that a higher  content was present in postnatal day 2 (P2) FSP1cre- livers, which diminished after weaning. Quantification of total lipids and triglycerides revealed that P2 and week 4 of age FSP1cre- livers have higher levels of both. qPCR analysis also showed upregulation of genes involved in fatty  β-oxidation, and fatty  and triglyceride synthesis pathways. This result is further supported by western blot analysis of proteins in these pathways. Hence, we propose that FSP1cre- mice, which accumulate lipids in their liver in early life, may represent a useful animal model to study juvenile NAFLD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31637215>mTOR/HDAC1 Crosstalk Mediated Suppression of ADH1A and ALDH2 Links Alcohol  to Hepatocellular Carcinoma Onset and Progression .</a></h1><p>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is ranked the third deadliest cancer worldwide whose molecular pathogenesis is not fully understood. Although deregulated metabolic pathways have been implicated in HCC onset and progression, the mechanisms triggering this metabolic imbalance are yet to be explored. Here, we identified a gene signature coding catabolic enzymes (Cat-GS) involved in key metabolic pathways like amino , , carbohydrate, drug, and retinol  as suppressed in HCC. A higher expression of deregulated Cat-GS is associated with good survival and less aggressive disease state in HCC patients. On the other hand, we identified mTOR signaling as a key determinant in HCC onset and progression, whose hyperactivation is found associated with poor survival and aggressive disease state in HCC patients. Next, out of Cat-GS, we established two key regulators of alcohol , alcohol dehydrogenase 1A (ADH1A) and aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2), as being transcriptionally suppressed by histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) at the downstream of mTORC1 signaling. Suppressed ADH1A and ALDH2 expression aligns well with HCC-specific molecular profile and can efficiently predict disease onset and progression, whereas higher ADH1A and ALDH2 expression is associated with good survival and less aggressive disease state in HCC patients. Overall, our  findings suggest that transcriptional suppression of alcohol  regulators, ADH1A and ALDH2, at the downstream of mTOR signaling is, in part, responsible for triggering oncogenic transformation of hepatocytes resulting in disease onset and progression in HCC.Copyright © 2019 Zahid, Yao, Khan, Raza and Gou.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666728>Metabolic rearrangements in primary liver cancers: cause and consequences.</a></h1><p>Primary liver cancer (PLC) is the fourth most frequent cause of cancer-related death. The high mortality rates arise from late diagnosis and the limited accuracy of diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers. The liver is a major regulator, orchestrating the clearance of toxins, balancing glucose,  and amino  uptake, managing whole-body  and maintaining metabolic homeostasis. Tumour onset and progression is frequently accompanied by rearrangements of metabolic pathways, leading to dysregulation of . The limitation of current therapies targeting PLCs, such as hepatocellular carcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma, points towards the importance of deciphering this metabolic complexity. In this Review, we discuss the role of metabolic liver disruptions and the implications of these processes in PLCs, emphasizing their clinical relevance and value in early diagnosis and prognosis and as putative therapeutic targets. We also describe system biology approaches able to reconstruct the metabolic complexity of liver diseases. We also discuss whether metabolic rearrangements are a cause or consequence of PLCs, emphasizing the opportunity to clinically exploit the rewired . In line with this idea, we discuss circulating metabolites as promising biomarkers for PLCs.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665044>Role of mitochondria and cardiolipins in growth inhibition of breast cancer cells by retinoic .</a></h1><p>All-trans-retinoic- (ATRA) is a promising agent in the prevention/treatment of breast-cancer. There is growing evidence that reprogramming of cellular  contributes to malignant transformation and progression.  is implicated in cell differentiation and metastatic colonization and it is involved in the mechanisms of sensitivity/resistance to different anti-tumor agents. The role played by lipids in the anti-tumor activity of ATRA has never been studied.We used 16 breast cancer cell-lines whose degree of sensitivity to the anti-proliferative action of ATRA is known. We implemented a non-oriented mass-spectrometry based approach to define the lipidomic profiles of each cell-line grown under basal conditions and following treatment with ATRA. To complement the lipidomic data, untreated and retinoid treated cell-lines were also subjected to RNA-sequencing to define the perturbations afforded by ATRA on the whole-genome gene-expression profiles. The number and functional activity of mitochondria were determined in selected ATRA-sensitive and -resistant cell-lines. Bio-computing approaches were used to analyse the high-throughput lipidomic and transcriptomic data.ATRA perturbs the homeostasis of numerous lipids and the most relevant effects are observed on cardiolipins, which are located in the mitochondrial inner membranes and play a role in oxidative-phosphorylation. ATRA reduces the amounts of cardiolipins and the effect is associated with the growth-inhibitory activity of the retinoid. Down-regulation of cardiolipins is due to a reduction of mitochondria, which is caused by an ATRA-dependent decrease in the expression of nuclear genes encoding mitochondrial proteins. This demonstrates that ATRA anti-tumor activity is due to a decrease in the amounts of mitochondria causing deficits in the respiration/energy-balance of breast-cancer cells.The observation that ATRA anti-proliferative activity is caused by a reduction in the respiration and energy balance of the tumor cells has important ramifications for the therapeutic action of ATRA in breast cancer. The study may open the way to the development of rational therapeutic combinations based on the use of ATRA and anti-tumor agents targeting the mitochondria.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31626814>Mathematical model of diabetes and .</a></h1><p>An original model of diabetes linked to carbohydrate and  intake is presented and applied to predict the effects on biomarkers of various diets. The variables (biomarkers) are concentrations of fasting plasma glucose, insulin, leptin, glucagon, non-esterified fatty  (NEFA) and very low density lipoprotein triglyceride (VLDLTG), as well as muscle lipids, hepatic lipids, pancreatic lipids,  mass and mass of β-cells. The model predicts isocaloric high carbohydrate low  (HCLF) diet and low carbohydrate high  (LCHF) diet trajectories to health which vary in  mass by at most a few kilograms at steady state. The LCHF trajectories to health are faster than isocaloric HCLF trajectories with respect to  mass loss, although these trajectories may be slower initially if parameters are adjusting from HCLF values. On LC diets, leptin sensitivity and VLDLTG clearance are thought to increase. Increasing leptin sensitivity and VLDLTG clearance is predicted to lower lipids including  mass and VLDLTG. The model predicts that changes in VLDLTG due to a change in diet happen rapidly, approaching steady state values after a few weeks, reflecting leptin sensitivity and VLDLTG clearance which are much harder to measure. The model predicts that if only insulin sensitivity increases on a LC diet, steady state  mass would increase slightly. If leptin and insulin sensitivities increase concurrently, the combined effect could be a decrease in  mass, consistent with the fact that increasing insulin sensitivity is often associated with  mass loss in trials. The model predicts trajectories to  type II diabetes with hypertriglyceridemia due to high carbohydrate moderate  diets, on which insulin rises before falling, as ectopic  deposits increase; made fatter and more diabetic by higher  consumption. It predicts trajectories to non-diabetic states with raised  mass, VLDLTG and muscle, hepatic and pancreatic lipids due to moderate carbohydrate high  diets. The model predicts paths to lean type II diabetes, on a diet of moderate energy but low β-cell replication rate or high death rate.Copyright © 2019.

What is less well studied is how resting cells metabolically shift from an ATP-producing catabolic  to a  that supports anabolic growth. In metazoan organisms, the discovery of growth factors and the ability of their receptors to induce new transcription and translation led to the hypothesis that the bioenergetic and synthetic demands of cell growth were primarily met through the replacement of nutrients consumed during net macromolecular synthesis, a demand-based system of nutrient uptake. Recent data have challenged this hypothesis. Instead there is increasing evidence that cellular nutrient uptake is a push system. Growth factor signaling has been linked to direct stimulation of nutrient uptake. The ability of growth factor signaling to increase the uptake of glucose, lipids, and amino  to levels that exceed a cell's bioenergetic and synthetic needs has been documented in a wide variety of settings. In some tissues, this leads to the storage of the excess nutrients in the form of glycogen or . In others, the excess is secreted as lactate and certain non-essential amino . When growth factor signaling stimulates nutrient uptake to levels that exceed a cell's bioenergetic needs, adaptive changes in intermediate  lead to the production of anabolic precursors that fuel the net synthesis of protein, lipids, and nucleic . Through the increased production of these precursors, growth factor signaling provides a supply side stimulation of cell growth and proliferation.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666411>[The fenofibrate effect on genotoxicity in brain and liver and on the expression of genes regulating fatty   of mice].</a></h1><p>Fibrates are well-known agonists of the PPAR family (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors). This class of drugs is used for the treatment of dyslipidemia and atherosclerosis. Fenofibrate is one of the members of this class of synthetic PPARα receptor ligands. The oral administration of 0.3% fenofibrate caused a decrease in strength due to loss of body weight in laboratory animals when improving behavioural features. Analysis of the mitochondrial DNA of liver cells showed a genotoxic effect of fenofibrate, due to accumulation of reactive oxygen species, which could be attributed to activation of peroxisomal β-oxidation processes, as well as to the lack of increase in the expression of genes encoding antioxidant defense proteins. Treatment with fenofibrate did not cause brain mtDNA damage. It has been shown that fenofibrate induced mitochondrial β-oxidation in the brain, as indicated by the increased expression of the Acadm and Cpt1a and Ppargc1a and Ppara. The study found no effect of fenofibrate on the increase of mitochondrial biogenesis in brain and liver cells. Thus, we can conclude that fenofibrate significantly affects  in the liver and brain, but in the liver it is associated with an increase of oxidative stress, resulting in mtDNA oxidative damage. However, fenofibrate-induced increase in the expression of Ppargc1a is not associated with an increase of mitochondrial biogenesis. This is consistent with the recent suggestion that PGC-1α might not be a master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31615399>Identification of differentially expressed genes and pathways between intramuscular and abdominal -derived preadipocyte differentiation of chickens in vitro.</a></h1><p>The distribution and deposition of  tissue in different parts of the body are the key factors affecting the carcass quality and meat flavour of chickens. Intramuscular  (IMF) content is an important factor associated with meat quality, while abdominal  (AbF) is regarded as one of the main factors affecting poultry slaughter efficiency. To investigate the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and molecular regulatory mechanisms related to adipogenic differentiation between IMF- and AbF-derived preadipocytes, we analysed the mRNA expression profiles in preadipocytes (0d, Pre-) and adipocytes (10d, Ad-) from IMF and AbF of Gushi chickens.AbF-derived preadipocytes exhibited a higher adipogenic differentiation ability (96.4% + 0.6) than IMF-derived preadipocytes (86.0% + 0.4) (p < 0.01). By Ribo-Zero RNA sequencing, we obtained 4403 (2055 upregulated and 2348 downregulated) and 4693 (2797 upregulated and 1896 downregulated) DEGs between preadipocytes and adipocytes in the IMF and Ad groups, respectively. For IMF-derived preadipocyte differentiation, pathways related to the PPAR signalling pathway, ECM-receptor interaction and focal adhesion pathway were significantly enriched. For AbF-derived preadipocyte differentiation, the steroid biosynthesis pathways, calcium signaling pathway and ECM-receptor interaction pathway were significantly enriched. A large number of DEGs related to , fatty   and preadipocyte differentiation, such as PPARG, ACSBG2, FABP4, FASN, APOA1 and INSIG1, were identified in our study.This study revealed large transcriptomic differences between IMF- and AbF-derived preadipocyte differentiation. A large number of DEGs and transcription factors that were closely related to fatty  ,  and preadipocyte differentiation were identified in the present study. Additionally, the microenvironment of IMF- and AbF-derived preadipocyte may play a significant role in adipogenic differentiation.

This is well studied for monogastric species but still not well understood for ruminants and especially for the most unconventional species, like cervids. This study investigated the influence of ruminally protected lysine (Lys) and methionine (Met) supplementation during the fattening period, as well as two slaughter seasons (late autumn (LA) v. late winter (LW)), on the growth, carcass traits, body condition and blood plasma metabolites of fallow deer (Dama dama). Forty-five yearlings of fallow deer bucks were allocated into three groups, balanced by weight (40.2 ± 2.7 kg). The deer were pasture-fed and supplemented with barley, free-choice mineral premix, silage during the winter period, and varying levels of ruminally protected Lys and Met: no amino  (Control), 9 g/day of Lys, and 9 g/day of Lys plus 3 g/day of Met (Lys+Met). Animals were slaughtered in two separate seasons, LA (six animals per group), and LW (nine animals per group). Animals culled in LA had higher average daily weight gain than LW (P = 0.002), due to the reduced growth during winter typical for seasonal cervids in temperate zone, mediated by the photoperiod. Dressing percentage was significantly higher in LW and in the Lys+Met group (P = 0.002). Body condition score (P = 0.024), kidney  index (KFI) (P = 0.005), and internal  (P < 0.001) increased significantly with Lys+Met supplementation. During LW, KFI (P = 0.004) and kidney  (P = 0.001) were also significantly higher than in LA. Blood creatinine concentration increased significantly for deer receiving Lys (P = 0.002) and Lys+Met (P < 0.001). Also, triglycerides level increased in Lys group (P < 0.001). These findings highlight the effects of Lys and Met supplementation on the growth and internal  storage for winter survival, suggesting a different use of the supplemented resource according to the season. Also, the observed effects on protein and  of fallow deer may influence the production of farmed animals, and offer interesting insights about the physiology of the species.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31585243>RNA-seq revealed the signatures of immunity and  in the Litopenaeus vannamei intestine in response to dietary succinate.</a></h1><p>The intestine is important for nutrition,  and immunity. Succinate (SA) plays a vital role in the physiological homeostasis of animal intestines. However, the effects of dietary SA on the intestinal immunity and  in shrimp are not clear. In this study, we investigated the immune and metabolic responses in the intestine of Litopenaeus vannamei that were fed diets consisting of different levels of SA: 0 g/kg (Con) and 10 g/kg (SA) for 56 days. The results from a RNA-seq analysis identified 6005 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), including 2728 upregulated genes and 3277 downregulated genes, which were grouped into 312 pathways. The DEGs were most enriched in pathways related to protein synthesis and amino  , including "ribosome", "aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis", "pyrimidine ", and "arginine and proline "; additionally, carbohydrate and  pathways were also activated. A large number of immune-related genes were associated with mucus barrier modification, antimicrobial activity, pathogen attachment and recognition, antioxidant activity, and apoptosis. The expression patterns of several candidate genes involved in the immune response and nutrition  were detected by qPCR. This study provides insight into the transcriptomic modulating mechanisms associated with intestinal immunity and the  of L. vannamei in response to the intake of dietary SA.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Acute dietary treatment with docosahexaenoic  (DHA) increases oocyte quality and ovarian reserve at advanced reproductive age. We hypothesized that DHA supplementation after HFD exposure reverses HFD-induced ovarian defects. We conducted a dietary intervention with reversal to chow, DHA-supplemented chow, or DHA-supplemented HFD after HFD consumption. After 10 weeks, HFD-fed mice had impaired estrous cyclicity, decreased primordial follicles, and altered ovarian expression of 24 genes compared to chow controls. Diet reversal to either chow or chow + DHA restored estrous cyclicity, however only chow + DHA appeared to mitigated the impact of HFD on ovarian reserve. All dietary interventions restored HFD-dysregulated gene expression to chow levels. We found no association between follicular fluid DHA levels and ovarian reserve. In conclusion our data suggest some benefit of DHA supplementation after HFD, particularly in regards to ovarian gene expression, however complete restoration of ovarian function was not achieved.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

We previously identified a series of indole-based OXE receptor antagonists that rapidly appear in the blood following oral administration but have limited lifetimes. The objective of this study was to increase the potency and plasma half-lives of these compounds and thereby identify the optimal candidate for future preclinical studies in monkeys, since rodents do not have an OXE receptor ortholog.We synthesized a series of substituted phenylalkyl indoles and compared their antagonist potencies, pharmacokinetics, and  to those of our earlier compounds. The potencies of some of their metabolites were also investigated.Among the compounds tested, the S-enantiomer of the m-chlorophenyl compound (S-Y048) was the most potent, with an pIC of about 10.8 for inhibition of 5-oxo-ETE-induced calcium mobilization in human neutrophils. When administered orally to cynomolgus monkeys, S-Y048 rapidly appeared in the blood and had a half-life in plasma of over 7 h, considerably longer than any of the other OXE analogs tested. A major hydroxylated metabolite, with a potency close to that of its precursor, was identified in plasma.Because of its highly potent antagonist activity and its long lifetime in vivo, S-Y048 may be a useful anti-inflammatory agent for the treatment of eosinophilic diseases such as asthma, allergic rhinitis, and atopic dermatitis.This article is protected by copyright.

Linoleic  (LA) and α-linolenic  (ALA) are members of two classes of PUFAs, namely the n-6 and n-3 series, which are required for normal human health. Both are considered precursors of a cascade of molecules (eicosanoids), which take part in many biological processes (inflammation, vasoconstriction/vasodilation, thromboregulation, etc.). However, their biological functions are opposite and are mainly related to the form (precursor or long-chain products) in which they were administered and to the enzyme-substrate preference. ALA is widely present in common vegetable oils and foods, marine algae, and natural herbs, whereas its long-chain PUFA derivatives are available mainly in fish and animal product origins. Recent studies have shown that the accumulation of n-3 PUFAs seems mostly to be tissue-dependent and acts in a tissue-selective manner. Furthermore, dietary n-3 PUFAs widely affect the  oxidation susceptibility of all tissues. In conclusion, sustainable sources of n-3 PUFAs are limited and exert a different effect about (1) the form in which they are administered, precursor or derivatives; (2) their antioxidant protections; and (3) the purpose to be achieved (health improvement, physiological and reproductive traits, metabolic pathways, etc.).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31584940>Manipulating mtDNA in vivo reprograms  via novel response mechanisms.</a></h1><p>Mitochondria have been increasingly recognized as a central regulatory nexus for multiple metabolic pathways, in addition to ATP production via oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Here we show that inducing mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) stress in Drosophila using a mitochondrially-targeted Type I restriction endonuclease (mtEcoBI) results in unexpected metabolic reprogramming in adult flies, distinct from effects on OXPHOS. Carbohydrate utilization was repressed, with catabolism shifted towards  oxidation, accompanied by elevated serine synthesis. Cleavage and translocation, the two modes of mtEcoBI action, repressed carbohydrate rmetabolism via two different mechanisms. DNA cleavage activity induced a type II diabetes-like phenotype involving deactivation of Akt kinase and inhibition of pyruvate dehydrogenase, whilst translocation decreased post-translational protein acetylation by cytonuclear depletion of acetyl-CoA (AcCoA).

We performed a direct, quantitative comparison of hepatic fibrosis progression in well-defined methionine- and choline-deficient (MCD) and choline-deficient, amino- defined (CDAA) diets with increasing  content (10-60% by calories) in C57Bl/6J and BALB/cAnNCrl mice.In C57Bl/6J mice, MCD feeding resulted in moderate fibrosis at week 8 (2-fold increase in hepatic collagen content) and progressive weight loss, irrespective of  content. In contrast, CDAA-fed mice did not lose weight and developed progressive fibrosis starting from week 4. High dietary  in the CDAA diet model dose-dependently induced the  genes SREBP and SCD2, and increased the ductular reaction and fibrosis. Longitudinal analysis of CDAA with 60%  (HF-CDAA) feeding revealed pronounced ductular reaction and perisinusoidal bridging fibrosis, with a 7-fold increase of hepatic collagen at week 12, that showed limited spontaneous reversibility. At 24 weeks, HF-CDAA mice developed signs of cirrhosis with 10-fold HYP increase, regenerative nodules, portal hypertension and elevated serum bilirubin and ammonia; 80% of mice (8/10) developed multiple hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC). High  supplementation of MCD in C57Bl/6J, or feeding HF-CDAA diet to fibrosis-prone BALB/cAnNCrl strain failed to result in increased fibrosis.In conclusion, HF-CDAA feeding in C57Bl/6J mice was identified as an optimal model of steatohepatitis with robust fibrosis and ductular proliferations that progress to cirrhosis and HCC within 24 weeks.

The identification of new effective biological markers for AMI is a prerequisite for treatment. Most proteomic studies have focused on atherosclerotic plaques, vascular cells, monocytes and platelets in the blood; however, the concentration of these factors in plasma is low, making it difficult to measure the complexity of plasma components. Moreover, some studies have examined the plasma protein of patients with acute coronary syndrome with histochemistry; however, the results are not consistent. Therefore, it is necessary to further investigate the differential proteins in the plasma of patients with AMI via proteomics to identify new biomarkers of AMI.In this study, immunodepletion of high-abundance plasma proteins followed by an isobaric tagging for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ)-based quantitative proteomic approach was used to analyze plasma samples from 5 control individuals and 10 AMI patients.Four hundred sixty-eight proteins were identified from two samples, and 33 proteins were differentially expressed in AMI patients compared to the controls. Among the 33 proteins, 12 proteins showed a ≥1.5-fold change between AMI and control samples. These proteins included fatty  binding protein 3 (FABP3, ratio =6.36), creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB ratio =4.89), adenylate kinase1 (AK1 ratio =4.16), pro-platelet basic protein (PPBP ratio =3.29), creatine kinase (CK ratio =2.88), platelet factor 4 (PF4 ratio =2.62), peptidyl prolyl isomerase Cyclophilin A (PPIA ratio =2.05), Cofilin-1 (CFL1 ratio =1.81), coronin1A (CORO1A ratio =1.71), protein kinase M (PKM ratio =1.63), ribonuclease inhibitor (RNH1, ratio =1.67), and triose phosphate isomerase (TPI1 ratio =1.56). By contrast, there was a decrease of 19 proteins, such as adiponectin (ADIPOQ ratio =0.70), insulin-like growth factor binding protein6 (IGFBP6 ratio =0.70), Dickkopf-related protein 3 (DKK3 ratio =0.70) and complement 4B (C4B ratio =0.68). The most over-represented term was regulation of cell proliferation in the cellular component category of Gene Ontology (GO). The top 3 biological process terms were regulation of cell proliferation, response to wounding and wound healing. These proteins included immune proteins, blood coagulation proteins,  proteins, cytoskeleton proteins, energy  proteins, gene regulation proteins, myocutaneous proteins, and myocardial remodeling proteins and were highly connected with each other, which indicates that the functional network of these processes contribute to the pathophysiology of AMI.In conclusion, the present quantitative proteomic study identified novel AMI biomarker candidates and might provide fundamental information for the development of an AMI biomarker.2019 Journal of Thoracic Disease.

To determine maternal and fetal contributions to metabolic flexibility during gestation, pregnant mice with genetic impairments in mitochondrial carbohydrate and/or  were subjected to nutrient deprivation. The maternal fasting response initiates a fetal liver transcriptional program marked by upregulation of - and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (Pparα)-regulated genes. Impaired maternal  alters circulating  metabolite concentrations and enhances the fetal response to fasting, which is largely dependent on fetal Pparα. Maternal fasting also improves metabolic deficits in fetal carbohydrate  by increasing the availability of alternative substrates. Impairment of both carbohydrate and  in pregnant dams further exacerbates the fetal liver transcriptional response to nutrient deprivation. Together, these data demonstrate a regulatory role for mitochondrial macronutrient  in mediating maternal-fetal metabolic communication, particularly when nutrients are limited.Copyright © 2019 The Author(s).

We analyzed the clinical data from 1421 T2DM inpatients at Wuhan Union Hospital. Subjects were divided into early-onset T2DM group (diagnostic age <40 years) and late-onset T2DM group (diagnostic age >40 years). All subjects underwent a standardized assessment of microvascular complications. Data were compared with independent-samples t test or Chi-square test. Multiple logistic regression was used to determine the risk factors of microvascular complications. Patients with early-onset T2DM were more inclined to have a lower systolic blood pressure (SBP), a longer duration of diabetes and higher levels of body mass index (BMI), uric  (UA), fasting plasma glucose (FPG), total cholesterol (TC)- triglyceride (TG) and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) than those with late-onset T2DM (P<0.05). The prevalence of diabetic retinopathy (DR) was significantly higher and that of diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) was significantly lower in early-onset group than in late-onset group (P<0.05). For DN, UA was an independent risk factor in early-onset T2DM. SBP and TG were independent risk factors in late-onset T2DM. For DR, duration of diabetes and SBP were independent risk factors in early-onset T2DM. Duration of diabetes, SBP and HbA1c were independent risk factors in late-onset T2DM. This study demonstrated that the clinical characteristics of early-onset T2DM were metabolic disorders, including glucose ,  and amino  . Early-onset T2DM was more likely to be associated with DR.

Although LPZ target tissues remain poorly understood, possible sites of action include adipose tissue. In this study, we assessed effects of LPZ on adipocyte differentiation and function by using 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and HFD-induced obesity mice as an in vitro and in vivo model, respectively.Oil red O staining and intracellular triacylglycerol content were used to determine  accumulation. Glucose uptake was performed to measure mature adipocyte function. Expression of adipocyte genes was determined by qRT-PCR and immunoblotting.LPZ has dual effects on differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells. At low concentrations, LPZ enhanced adipocyte differentiation via induction of PPARγ and C/EBPα, two master adipogenic transcription factors, as well as lipogenic proteins, ACC1 and FASN. Increasing of adipocyte number subsequently increased basal and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, and expression of Glut4 mRNA. Conversely, high concentrations of LPZ strongly inhibited differentiation and expression of PPARγ and C/EBPα, and maintained expression of preadipocytes markers, β-catenin and Pref-1. Inhibition of adipogenesis by LPZ reduced mature adipocyte number, Glut4 mRNA expression and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. In addition, treatment with LPZ at 200 mg/kg significantly reduced body weight gain and total  mass in HFD-induced obese mice.These results indicate that effects of LPZ on adipocyte differentiation are dependent on concentration and are correlated with PPARγ and C/EBPα.Copyright © 2019.

Little is known about the physiological and molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of short-term repression of N  on tea roots and leaves for a short time.In this study, we subjected tea plants to a specific inhibitor of glutamine synthetase (GS), methionine sulfoximine (MSX), for a short time (30 min) and investigated the effect of the inhibition of N  on the transcriptome and metabolome of quality-related compounds. Our results showed that GS activities in tea roots and leaves were significantly inhibited upon MSX treatment, and both tissue types showed a sensitive metabolic response to GS inhibition. In tea leaves, the hydrolysis of theanine decreased with the increase in theanine and free ammonium content. The biosynthesis of all other amino  was repressed, and the content of N-containing lipids declined, suggesting that short-term inhibition of GS reduces the level of N reutilization in tea leaves. Metabolites related to glycolysis and the tricarboxylic  (TCA) cycle accumulated after GS repression, whereas the content of amino  such as glycine, serine, isoleucine, threonine, leucine, and valine declined in the MXS treated group. We speculate that the biosynthesis of amino  is affected by glycolysis and the TCA cycle in a feedback loop.Overall, our data suggest that GS repression in tea plant leads to the reprogramming of amino  and  metabolic pathways.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31594827>Distinct Gut Microbiota Induced by Different -to-Sugar-Ratio High-Energy Diets Share Similar Pro-obesity Genetic and Metabolite Profiles in Prediabetic Mice.</a></h1><p>Gut microbiota play important roles in host , especially in diabetes. However, why different diets lead to similar diabetic states despite being associated with different microbiota is not clear. Mice were fed two high-energy diets (HED) with the same energy density but different -to-sugar ratios to determine the associations between the microbiota and early-stage metabolic syndrome. The two diets resulted in different microbiota but similar diabetic states. Interestingly, the microbial gene profiles were not significantly different, and many common metabolites were identified, including l-aspartic , cholestan-3-ol (5β, 3α), and campesterol, which have been associated with lipogenesis and inflammation. Our study suggests that different metabolic-syndrome-inducing diets may result in different microbiota but similar microbiomes and metabolomes. This suggests that the metagenome and metabolome are crucial for the prognosis and pathogenesis of obesity and metabolic syndrome. Various types of diet can lead to type 2 diabetes. The gut microbiota in type 2 diabetic patients are also different. So, two questions arise: whether there are any commonalities between gut microbiota induced by different pro-obese diets and whether these commonalities lead to disease. Here we found that high-energy diets with two different -to-sugar ratios can both cause obesity and prediabetes but enrich different gut microbiota. Still, these different gut microbiota have similar genetic and metabolite compositions. The microbial metabolites in common between the diets modulate  accumulation and macrophage inflammation  and  This work suggests that studies that only use 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing to determine how the microbes respond to diet and associate with diabetic state are missing vital information.Copyright © 2019 Shan et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31599132>Emerging Mechanisms of GH-Induced Lipolysis and Insulin Resistance.</a></h1><p>Growth hormone (GH) is a pleiotropic hormone that coordinates an array of physiological processes including growth and . GH promotes anabolic action in all tissues except adipose, where it catabolizes stored  to release energy for the promotion of growth in other tissues. However, chronic stimulation of lipolysis by GH results in an increased flux of free fatty  (FFAs) into systemic circulation. Hence, a sustained release of high levels of GH contributes significantly to the development of insulin resistance by antagonizing the anti-lipolytic action of insulin. The molecular pathways associated with the lipolytic effect of GH in adipose tissue however, remain elusive. Recent studies have provided molecular insights into GH-induced lipolysis and impairment of insulin signaling. This review discusses the physiological and metabolic actions of GH on adipose tissue as well as GH-mediated deregulation of the FSP27-PPARγ axis which alters adipose tissue homeostasis and contributes to the development of insulin resistance and Type 2 diabetes.Copyright© of YS Medical Media ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31623832>The saturated fatty  palmitate induces insulin resistance through Smad3-mediated down-regulation of FNDC5 in myotubes.</a></h1><p>Elevated plasma free fatty  (FFA) levels are associated with insulin resistance and can cause lipotoxicity in skeletal muscles. In response to FFAs, skeletal muscle can secrete a variety of cytokines. Irisin, one such muscle-secreted cytokine, can improve glucose tolerance, glucose uptake, and . It is produced by the transmembrane protein fibronectin type Ⅲ domain containing 5 (FNDC5) by specific proteases. The purpose of this study was to investigate the regulatory mechanisms of the FNDC5 response to palmitate and their relationships with insulin resistance in C2C12 myotubes. RNA sequencing analysis results from C2C12 myotubes treated with palmitate showed that palmitate could activate the TGF-β signaling pathway. Palmitate directly affected the expression of Smad3, but not its phosphorylation level, in C2C12 myotubes. Furthermore, knockdown and knockout of Smad3 alleviated the inhibitory effect of palmitate on the expression of FNDC5. In contrast, overexpression of Smad3 aggravated the inhibition of FNDC5 expression. There is a Smad3 binding motif in the -660 bp to -649 bp region of the Fndc5 promoter. CRISPR/Cas9 knockout of this region also alleviated the inhibition of FNDC5 expression in response to palmitate. More importantly, inhibition of FNDC5 expression mediated by Smad3 led to a decrease in insulin sensitivity in C2C12 myotubes. Collectively, these findings suggest that palmitate could induce insulin resistance through Smad3-mediated down-regulation of the Fndc5 gene.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

It has been postulated that muscle fatty -binding protein (FABP) is needed for the efficient translocation of fatty  through the aqueous cytosol towards mitochondrial β-oxidation. To assess whether FABP is required for this process, dsRNA was injected into freshly emerged adult males to knockdown the expression of FABP.

At rest, control and treated animals exhibited no morphological or behavioral differences. In tethered flight experiments, both control and treated insects were able to fly continually in the initial, carbohydrate-fueled phase of flight, and in both groups lipids were mobilized and released into the hemolymph. Flight periods exceeding thirty minutes, however, when fatty  become the main energy source, were rarely possible for FABP-depleted animals, while control insects continued to fly for more than 2 h.

In recent years, the role of lipokines, which are  species predominantly secreted from adipose tissue that act as hormonal regulators in many metabolic tissues, has been an important area of research for obesity and diabetes. Previous studies have identified that these secreted lipids, including palmitoleate, 12,13-diHOME, and fatty -hydroxy-fatty  (FAHFA) species, are important regulators of . Moreover, environmental factors that directly affect the secretion of lipokines such as diet, exercise, and exposure to cold temperatures constitute attractive therapeutic strategies, but the mechanisms that regulate lipokine stimulation have not been thoroughly reviewed. In this study, we will discuss the chemical characteristics of lipokines that position them as attractive targets for chronic disease treatment and prevention and the emerging roles of lipokines as regulators of inter-tissue communication. We will define the target tissues of lipokines, and explore the ability of lipokines to prevent or delay the onset and development of chronic diseases.

The peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) primarily regulates the expression of target genes involved in energy control as well as  and glucose . Although the pivotal roles of these receptors on female fertility have been reported, there are limited studies addressing PPARs role(s) in the male. This study was designed to determine and compare  and  mRNA expression in sperm cells of normozoospermic and asthenozoospermic men. In addition, flow cytometric analyses, immunofluorescence and western blot were used to evaluate PPARγ protein levels in spermatozoa. We have compared the sperm  mRNA relative expression in 27 normozoospermic and 28 asthenozoospermic samples and monitored sperm PPARγ protein levels in 39 normozoospermic and 40 asthenozoospermic samples using flow cytometry. We have also assessed in a sub-group of seven normozoospermic and eight asthenozoospermic samples, PPARγ protein levels by western blotting. Relative expression of PPARγ mRNA in normozoospermic men was found to be significantly higher (P = 0.004) than in asthenozoospermic men while  and  relative expression was similar in the two groups. Likewise,  showed a positive correlation with motility (r = 0.34; P < 0.05), sperm concentration (r = 0.33) and the percentage of progressive motile spermatozoa (r = 0.31). In agreement with the mRNA behavior, sperm PPARγ protein levels as measured by flow cytometry (P = 0.066) and western blot (P = 0.089) showed a tendency to be higher in normozoospermic than asthenozoospermic men.

Hepatic cholesterol is then converted into bile  (BAs) that are secreted into the intestine and largely maintained within the enterohepatic circulation. We now aimed to evaluate the effects of prolonged brown  activation combined with inhibition of intestinal BA reabsorption on plasma cholesterol  and atherosclerosis development.APOE*3-Leiden.CETP mice with humanized lipoprotein  were treated for 9 weeks with the selective β3-adrenergic receptor (AR) agonist CL316,243 to substantially activate brown . Prolonged β3-AR agonism reduced fecal BA excretion (-31%), while markedly increasing plasma levels of total BAs (+258%), cholic -derived BAs (+295%) and chenodeoxycholic -derived BAs (+217%), and decreasing the expression of hepatic genes involved in BA production. In subsequent experiments mice were additionally treated with the BA sequestrant Colesevelam to inhibit BA reabsorption. Concomitant intestinal BA sequestration increased fecal BA excretion, normalized plasma BA levels and reduced hepatic cholesterol. Moreover, concomitant BA sequestration further reduced plasma total cholesterol (-49%) and non-high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (-56%), tended to further attenuate atherosclerotic lesion area (-54%). Concomitant BA sequestration further increased the proportion of lesion-free valves (+34%) and decreased the relative macrophage area within the lesion (-26%) thereby further increasing the plaque stability index (+44%).BA sequestration prevents the marked accumulation of plasma BAs as induced by prolonged brown  activation thereby further improving cholesterol  and reducing atherosclerosis development. These data suggest that combining brown  activation with BA sequestration is a promising new therapeutic strategy to reduce hyperlipidemia and cardiovascular diseases.Current therapeutic strategies are unable to prevent the majority of cardiovascular disease (CVD)-relating morbidities and mortalities, illustrating the need for new therapeutic strategies. Brown  has been shown as an emerging target to combat hyperlipidemia and atherosclerosis. Here we showed that prolonged brown  activation promotes bile  (BA) reabsorption, resulting in elevated plasma BA and hepatic cholesterol content, both of which are reversed by additional BA sequestration. Importantly, combining BA sequestration with brown  activation further lowers plasma cholesterol and reduces atherosclerosis development, indicating the combination therapy as a new therapeutic strategy to treat hyperlipidemia, and ultimately CVD.Published on behalf of the European Society of Cardiology.

In our previous study, we showed bitter melon extract (BME) prevents carcinogen induced mouse oral cancer. RNA sequence analysis from mouse tongue revealed a significant modulation in "Metabolic Process" by altering glycolysis and  metabolic pathways in BME fed group as compared to cancer group. In present study, we evaluated the effect of BME on glycolysis and  pathways in human oral cancer cells.Cal27 and JHU022 cells were treated with BME. RNA and protein expression were analysed for modulation of glycolytic and lipogenesis genes by quantitative real-time PCR, western blot analyses and immunofluorescence. Lactate and pyruvate level was determined by GC/MS. Extracellular acidification and glycolytic rate were measured using the Seahorse XF analyser. Shotgun lipidomics in Cal27 and JHU022 cell lines following BME treatment was performed by ESI/ MS. ROS was measured by FACS.Treatment with BME on oral cancer cell lines significantly reduced mRNA and protein expression levels of key glycolytic genes SLC2A1 (GLUT-1), PFKP, LDHA, PKM and PDK3. Pyruvate and lactate levels and glycolysis rate were reduced in oral cancer cells following BME treatment. In lipogenesis pathway, we observed a significant reduction of genes involves in fatty  biogenesis, ACLY, ACC1 and FASN, at the mRNA and protein levels following BME treatment. Further, BME treatment significantly reduced phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, and plasmenylethanolamine, and reduced iPLA2 activity. Additionally, BME treatment inhibited  raft marker flotillin expression and altered its subcellular localization. ER-stress associated CHOP expression and generation of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species were induced by BME, which facilitated apoptosis.Our study revealed that bitter melon extract inhibits glycolysis and  and induces ER and oxidative stress-mediated cell death in oral cancer.

Their varied functions are based on the phosphorylation pattern of their inositol ring, which can be recognized by selective binding domains in their effector proteins and be modified by a series of specific PIPn kinases and phosphatases, which control their interconversion in a spatial and temporal manner. Yet, a unique feature of PIPns remains largely unexplored: their unusually uniform acyl chain composition. Indeed, while most phospholipids present a range of molecular species comprising acyl chains of diverse length and saturation, PIPns in several organisms and tissues show the predominance of a single hydrophobic backbone, which in mammals is composed of arachidonoyl and stearoyl chains. Despite evolution having favoured this specific PIPn configuration, little is known regarding the mechanisms and functions behind it. In this review, we explore the metabolic pathways that could control the acyl chain composition of PIPns as well as the potential roles of this selective enrichment. While our understanding of this phenomenon has been constrained largely by the technical limitations in the methods traditionally employed in the PIPn field, we believe that the latest developments in PIPn analysis should shed light onto this old question.© 2019 The Author(s).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654895>Protective properties of milk sphingomyelin against dysfunctional , gut dysbiosis, and inflammation.</a></h1><p>The identification of natural bioactive compounds aimed at promoting optimal gut health and improving  is paramount in the prevention of chronic disease. In this review, we summarize basic science and clinical research examining the protective properties of milk sphingomyelin (SM) against dysfunctional , gut dysbiosis, and inflammation. Dietary SM dose-dependently reduces the intestinal absorption of cholesterol, triglycerides, and fatty  in cell culture and rodent studies. Overall, rodent feeding studies show dietary milk SM, milk polar  mixtures, and milk  globule membrane reduce serum and hepatic  concentrations. Furthermore, these hypolipidemic effects are observed in some supplementation studies in humans, although the extent of reductions in serum cholesterol is typically smaller and only one trial was conducted with purified SM. Dietary milk SM has been reported to affect the gut microbiota in rodent studies and its hydrolytic product, sphingosine, displays bactericidal activity in vitro. Milk SM may also improve gut barrier function to prevent the translocation of inflammatory gut bacteria-derived molecules. Current evidence from pre-clinical studies indicates that dietary milk SM has protective properties against dysfunctional , gut dysbiosis, and inflammation. The hypolipidemic effects of milk SM observed in animal studies have been reported in some human studies, although the magnitude of such effects is typically smaller.

Because of the diversity of clinical symptoms and onset age, the diagnosis of this disease is difficult. Therefore, biomarker tests have attracted significant attention for earlier diagnostics. In this study, we developed a simultaneous analysis method for five urinary conjugated cholesterol metabolites, which are potential diagnostic biomarkers for a rapid, convenient, and noninvasive chemical diagnosis, using liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS). By the method, their urinary concentrations were quantified and the NPC diagnostic performances were evaluated. The developed LC/MS/MS method showed high accuracy and and satisfied all analytical method validation criteria. Analyzing the urine of healthy controls and patients with NPC, three of five urinary conjugated cholesterol metabolites concentrations corrected by urinary creatinine were significantly higher in the patients with NPC. As a result of receiver operating characteristics analysis, the urinary metabolites might have excellent diagnostic marker performance. 3β-sulfooxy-7β-hydroxy-5-cholenoic  showed particularly excellent diagnostic performance with both 100% clinical sensitivity and specificity, suggesting that it is a useful NPC diagnostic marker. The urinary conjugated cholesterol metabolites exhibited high NPC diagnostic marker performance and could be used for NPC diagnosis.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31621205>MoLEU1, MoLEU2, and MoLEU4 regulated by MoLEU3 are involved in leucine biosynthesis, fungal development, and pathogenicity in Magnaporthe oryzae.</a></h1><p>Amino  are vital components in cell . Leucine is a regulatory factor that generates significant impact on protein synthesis/turnover, modulates diverse cellular signaling pathways and participates in oxidative processes and immune responses.

Recent studies indicated an emerging role of these eicosanoids in metabolic diseases and the EET signaling pathway was shown to be involved in hepatic insulin sensitivity. However, compared to vascular tissues, there is only limited knowledge about the underlying signaling pathways in the liver. Therefore, we employed an LC-MS/MS-based time-resolved phosphoproteomics approach to characterize 11,12-EET-mediated signaling events in the liver cell line Hepa 1-6. 11,12-EET treatment resulted in the time-dependent regulation of phosphopeptides involved in processes as yet unknown to be affected by EETs, including RNA processing, splicing and translation regulation. Pathway analysis combined with western blot-based validation revealed enhanced AKT/mTOR/p70S6K signaling as demonstrated by increased acute phosphorylation of AKT (Ser473) and p70S6K (Thr389). In addition, 11,12-EET treatment led to differential regulation of phosphopeptides including important mediators of the DNA damage response and we observed a prolonged induction of the etoposide-induced DNA damage marker γH2AX in response to 11,12-EET. In summary, our findings extend current knowledge of 11,12-EET signaling events and emphasize the importance of the AKT/mTOR/p70S6K pathway in hepatic 11,12-EET signaling.

Our results showed that topping affected carbon and nitrogen , photosynthesis and secondary  in the tobacco plants, while straw biochar-application to the soil resulted in amino  and  synthesis; additionally, it affected secondary  of the tobacco plants through carbon restoration and hormonal action, before and after topping. In addition to the new insights into the impact of biochar on crops, our findings provide a basis for biochar application measures in tobacco and other crops.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31665679>Probing the hepatotoxicity mechanisms of novel chlorinated polyfluoroalkyl sulfonates to zebrafish larvae: Implication of structural specificity.</a></h1><p>Hepatotoxicity in zebrafish (Danio rerio) larvae elicited by legacy perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and its three novel chlorinated alternatives, including chlorinated polyfluorooctane sulfonate (Cl-PFOS) and chlorinated polyfluoroalkyl ether sulfonates (6:2 and 8:2 Cl-PFESA analogs), was evaluated in this study. Upon 7-day separate exposure to the four target compounds at 1 µmol/L, significant hepatic steatosis in exposed larvae was evidenced by pathological micro/macro vacuolation, which was presumably attributed to the excess accumulation of , especially the overloaded triglyceride (TG) level. Disruption on gene transcription was subjected to a structure-dependent manner. In general, PFOS, Cl-PFOS and 6:2 Cl-PFESA of the identical carbon chain length (i.e. C8), despite with different substituents, displayed a similar activation mode and comparable disruptive potency on  responsive genes, which particularly promoted fatty  synthesis (acetyl-CoA carboxylase, acacb) and β-oxidation (cytochrome P450 enzymes-1A, cyp1a; peroxisomal acyl-CoA oxidase 1, acox1; and acyl-CoA dehy-drogenase, acadm). However, 8:2 Cl-PFESA with a prolonged carbon chain length (i.e. C10), preferentially disturbed fatty  exportation (apolipoprotein-B100, apob) and triggered a different modulation pattern on fatty  β-oxidation against the other three compounds. Molecular docking analysis indicated that 8:2 Cl-PFESA exhibited considerably higher peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) antagonism than others, corresponding to its unique suppression effect on fatty  β-oxidation responsive genes. To our knowledge, this is the first in vivo study reporting hepatotoxicity of Cl-PFOS and Cl-PFESAs to aquatic organisms. Although characterized with different toxic mode-of-action, these novel alternatives can elicit hepatic steatosis as strong as PFOS, stressing the biological risks in view of their global contamination.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

IUGR were hyperinsulinemic, hyperleptinemic and dyslipidemic with high circulating miR-122. In contrast, PNGR and IPGR displayed insufficient glucose, insulin and leptin amidst high ketones with a dichotomy in circulating miR-122 of PNGR<IPGR = CON. Examination of livers revealed a reduction in miR-122 expression in PNGR and IPGR reflecting the hepatic size. This reduction of hepatic miR-122 was associated with an increase in specific target transcripts (ALDO-A, BCKDK, PPAR-β) and those mediating fatty  oxidation (PGC-1α, CPT-1α), with a concomitant suppression of fatty  and cholesterol synthesizing transcripts (FAS, HMGCR). Functionally, these changes correlated with increased fatty  oxidation and mitochondrial CPT1α enzyme activity ex vivo. In vitro physiologic (serum starvation) and genetic manipulation of miR-122 in H4IIE hepatoma cells revealed fidelity in regulating ALDO-A/BCKDK, but an infidelity in perturbing fatty /cholesterol synthesizing and oxidizing gene transcripts. Nevertheless, changes in endogenous miR-122 maintained singular directionality while altering FAS/HMGCR and CPT-1α/PGC-1α, almost reflecting each other, and thereby maintaining a balance in fatty /cholesterol supply necessary to meet the in vitro demands of these rapidly proliferating transformed cells. Successive microarray based analysis, comparing IPGR to CON demonstrated differential expression of hypothalamic genes mediating cell proliferation and survival, appetite/energy balance, circadian rhythm and obesity/diabetes. We conclude that miR-122 regulates genes mediating fatty /cholesterol  in postnatal female rats, fueling the energy demand.Published by Elsevier Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31616913>Analysis of the Uterine Lumen in Fertility-Classified Heifers: I. Glucose, Prostaglandins and Lipids.</a></h1><p>Survival and growth of the bovine conceptus (embryo and associated extraembryonic membranes) is dependent on endometrial secretions or histotroph found in the uterine lumen. Previously, serial embryo transfer was used to classify heifers as high fertile (HF), subfertile (SF), or infertile (IF). Here, we investigated specific histotroph components (glucose, prostaglandins (PGs) and lipids) in the uterine lumen of day 17 pregnant and open fertility-classified heifers. Concentrations of glucose in the uterine lumen were increased by pregnancy, but did not differ among fertility-classified heifers. Differences in expression of genes encoding glucose transporters and involved with glycolysis and gluconeogenesis were observed between conceptuses collected from HF and SF heifers. In the uterine lumen, PGE2 and PGF2α were increased by pregnancy, and HF heifers had higher concentrations of PGE2, PGF2α and 6-keto-PFG1α than SF heifers. Differences were found in expression of genes regulating PG signaling, arachidonic  , and PPAR signaling among conceptuses and endometrium from fertility-classified heifers. Lipidomics was conducted exclusively in samples from HF heifers, and phosphatidylcholine was the main  class that increased in the uterine lumen by pregnancy. Expression of several  genes differed between HF and SF conceptuses, and a number of fatty  were differentially abundant in the uterine lumen of pregnant HF and SF heifers. These results support the ideas that uterine luminal histotroph impacts conceptus survival and programs its development and is a facet of dysregulated conceptus-endometrial interactions that result in loss of the conceptus in SF cattle during the implantation period of pregnancy establishment.© The Author(s) 2019.

Human MD2, an indispensable accessory protein in TLR4 signaling pathway, specifically recognizes lipopolysaccharides (LPS), thereby leading to the activation of TLR4 signaling pathway to produce many effectors that participate in inflammatory and immune responses against Gram-negative bacteria. Toll and immune deficiency (IMD) pathways are first characterized in Drosophila and are reportedly present in crustaceans, but the recognition and activation mechanism of these signaling pathways in crustaceans remains unclear. In the present study, a novel ML protein was characterized in mud crab (Scylla paramamosain) and designated as SpMD2. The complete SpMD2 cDNA sequence is 1114 bp long with a 465 bp open reading frame; it encodes a protein that contains 154 amino  (aa). In the deduced protein, a signal peptide (1-21 aa residues) and a ML domain (43-151 aa residues) were predicted. SpMD2 shared a similar three-dimensional structure and a close evolutionary relationship with human MD2. SpMD2 was highly expressed in gills, hemocytes, intestine, and hepatopancreas and was upregulated in gills and hemocytes after challenges with bacteria, thereby suggesting its involvement in antibacterial defense. Western blot assay showed that SpMD2 possesses strong binding activities to different bacteria and two fungi. ELISA demonstrated that SpMD2 exhibits binding abilities to LPS,  A, peptidoglycan (PGN), and lipoteichoic  (LTA). Its binding ability to LPS and  A were stronger than to PGN or LTA, implying that SpMD2 was an important LPS-binding protein in mud crab. Bacterial clearance assay revealed that the pre-incubation of Vibrio parahemolyticus with SpMD2 facilitates bacterial clearance in vivo and that knockdown of SpMD2 dramatically suppresses the bacterial clearance and decreases the expression of several antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). Furthermore, SpMD2 overexpression could enhance the promoter activity of SpALF2. These results revealed that SpMD2 affects bacterial clearance by regulating AMPs. Thus, by binding to LPS and by regulating AMPs, SpMD2 may function as a potential receptor, which is involved in the recognition and activation of a certain immune signaling pathway against Gram-negative bacteria. This study provides new insights into the diverse functions of ML proteins and into the antibacterial mechanisms of crustaceans.Copyright © 2019.

However, the utilization of lignin presents various challenges in that its complex composition and structure and high resistance to degradation. Lignin conversion through biological platform harnesses the catalytic power of microorganisms to decompose complex lignin molecules and obtain value-added products through biosynthesis. Given the heterogeneity of lignin, various microbial metabolic pathways are involved in lignin bioconversion processes, which has been characterized in extensive research work. With different types of lignin substrates (e.g., model compounds, technical lignin, and lignocellulosic biomass), several bacterial and fungal species have been proved to own lignin-degrading abilities and accumulate microbial products (e.g.,  and polyhydroxyalkanoates), while the lignin conversion efficiencies are still relatively low. Genetic and metabolic strategies have been developed to enhance lignin biodegradation by reprogramming microbial , and diverse products, such as vanillin and dicarboxylic  were also produced from lignin. This article aims at presenting a comprehensive review on lignin bioconversion including lignin degradation mechanisms, metabolic pathways, and applications for the production of value-added bioproducts. Advanced techniques on genetic and metabolic engineering are also covered in the recent development of biological platforms for lignin utilization. To conclude this article, the existing challenges for efficient lignin bioprocessing are analyzed and possible directions for future work are proposed.© 2019 American Institute of Chemical Engineers.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31663815>Preventive Action of Sterculic Oil on Metabolic Syndrome Development on a Fructose-Induced Rat Model.</a></h1><p>The metabolic syndrome (MS) underlies metabolic disorders considered risk factors for the development of diabetes and cardiovascular diseases, which are major causes of morbidity and mortality in most of the world.

Bile flowing from the liver is concentrated in the gallbladder and, in response to a meal, released into the upper intestine. In the intestines, bile  act as detergents and help to emulsify fats, aiding in their digestion and absorption. After participating in digestion in the small bowel, bile  are almost completely (95%) reabsorbed in the distal ileum and then retaken up from portal blood by the liver (enterohepatic circulation). The primary bile  synthesized in the liver are cholic and chenodeoxycholic  which are typically conjugated to glycine or taurine before secretion. In the intestine, the primary bile  are often converted by colonic bacteria to the secondary bile , predominantly deoxycholic  and lithocholic . The reabsorbed bile  are transported to the liver in portal blood. Conjugated bile  are then retaken up by hepatocytes via the sodium taurocholate cotransporter (NTCT), while unconjugated bile  are taken up by organic anion transporters that also take up bilirubin and other anions. The total bile  pool in humans is tightly controlled by a coordinated regulation of expression of genes involved with synthesis, secretion, reabsorption and reuptake of bile  by the liver. The major components of the bile  pool are cholic and chenodeoxycholic  with lesser amounts deoxycholic and lithocholic  and minor amounts of ursodeoxycholic . Bile  also act as signaling molecules and are important in regulation of their own synthesis, uptake and secretion as well as control of cholesterol synthesis and regulation of  and glucose . Bile  levels are increased in the serum and liver in patients with obstructive jaundice or cholestasis and, perhaps because of their inherent detergent activities, can cause hepatocyte injury. Thus, increased bile  levels in hepatocytes may account for some of the liver damage in cholestatic liver diseases. Bile  can be used as therapeutic agents, particularly in patients with cholestatic liver diseases where administered bile  (such as ursodeoxycholic ) replace the more lipophilic and toxic bile  that accumulate during cholestasis. Bile  are also useful for the medical treatment (dissolution) of gallstones by increasing bile  and decreasing cholesterol concentrations in bile (causing a less saturated bile). Bile  can also be useful as replacement therapy in patients with bile  synthetic defects. Finally, the other metabolic effects of bile  can be useful in treating metabolic diseases including nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Four bile  are currently approved for use in the United States and several others are under active investigation. Cholic  is used for treatment of inherited defects in bile  synthesis, chenodeoxycholic (chenodiol) and ursodeoxycholic (ursodiol)  for gallstone dissolution, and obeticholic and ursodiol for chronic cholestatic liver diseases, specifically primary biliary cirrhosis. Obeticholic  is under evaluation as therapy of other liver diseases including sclerosing cholangitis and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Ursodiol is used off label to prevent, treat or ameliorate several uncommon forms of liver disease, including intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy, sinusoidal obstruction syndrome, graft-vs-host disease, cystic fibrosis associated liver disease, parenteral nutrition related liver injury and even acute, drug induced liver injury. The long term efficacy in ameliorating the course of these diseases is, however, unproven. Separate documents are available in LiverTox for each of the currently available bile .

Severely compromised LPL activity causes familial chylomicronemia syndrome (FCS), which is associated with very high plasma triglyceride levels and increased risk of life-threatening pancreatitis. Currently, no approved pharmacological intervention can acutely lower plasma triglycerides in FCS. Low yield, high aggregation, and poor stability of recombinant LPL have thus far prevented development of enzyme replacement therapy. Recently, we showed that LPL monomers form 1:1 complexes with the LPL transporter glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchored high density lipoprotein binding protein 1 (GPIHBP1) and solved the structure of the complex. In the present work, we further characterized the monomeric LPL/GPIHBP1 complex, and its derivative, the LPL-GPIHBP1 fusion protein, with the goal of contributing to the development of an LPL enzyme replacement therapy. Fusion of LPL to GPIHBP1 increased yields of recombinant LPL, prevented LPL aggregation, stabilized LPL against spontaneous inactivation, and made it resistant to inactivation by the LPL antagonists angiopoietin-like protein 3(ANGPTL3) or ANGPTL4. The high stability of the fusion protein enabled us to identify LPL amino  that interact with ANGPTL4. Additionally, the LPL-GPIHBP1 fusion protein exibited high enzyme activity in in vitro assays. Importantly, both intravenous and subcutaneous administrations of the fusion protein lowered triglycerides in several mouse strains without causing adverse effects. These results indicate that the LPL-GPIHBP1 fusion protein has potential for use as a therapeutic for managing FCS.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31633401>The prospects of lipidic prodrugs: an old approach with an emerging future.</a></h1><p>Nowadays, prodrugs are no longer used as a last resort, rather, they are intentionally designed at the early stages of drug development.

In recent years, tree peony has been emerging as an oil crop. Therefore, combined analysis of the transcriptome and proteome of tree peony () seeds at 25, 32, 39, 53, 67, 81, 88, 95, and 109 days after pollination (DAP) was conducted to better understand the transcriptional and translational regulation of seed development and oil biosynthesis. A total of 38,482 unigenes and 2841 proteins were identified. A total of 26,912 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and 592 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were clustered into three groups corresponding to the rapid growth, seed inclusion enrichment and conversion, and late dehydration and mature stages of seed development. Fifteen  pathways were identified at both the transcriptome and proteome levels. Pathway enrichment analysis revealed that a period of rapid fatty  biosynthesis occurred at 53-88 DAP. Furthermore, 211 genes and 35 proteins associated with the fatty   pathway, 63 genes and 11 proteins associated with the biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty  (UFAs), and 115 genes and 24 proteins associated with ALA  were identified. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 16 putative fatty  desaturase (FAD)-encoding genes clustered into four  groups, eight of which exhibited the highest expression at 53 DAP, suggesting that they play an important role in ALA accumulation. RT-qPCR analysis indicated that the temporal expression patterns of oil biosynthesis genes were largely similar to the RNA-seq results. The expression patterns of fatty  - and seed development-related proteins determined by MRM were also highly consistent with the results obtained in the proteomic analysis. Correlation analysis indicated significant differences in the number and abundance of DEGs and DEPs but a high level of consistency in expression patterns and metabolic pathways. The results of the present study represent the first combined transcriptomic and proteomic analysis of tree peony seeds and provide insight into tree peony seed development and oil accumulation.© The Author(s) 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31620119>Interactome of the Autoimmune Risk Protein ANKRD55.</a></h1><p>The ankyrin repeat domain-55 () gene contains intronic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with risk to contract multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis or other autoimmune disorders. Risk alleles of these SNPs are associated with higher levels of ANKRD55 in CD4 T cells. The biological function of ANKRD55 is unknown, but given that ankyrin repeat domains constitute one of the most common protein-protein interaction platforms in nature, it is likely to function in complex with other proteins. Thus, identification of its protein interactomes may provide clues. We identified ANKRD55 interactomes via recombinant overexpression in HEK293 or HeLa cells and mass spectrometry. One hundred forty-eight specifically interacting proteins were found in total protein extracts and 22 in extracts of sucrose gradient-purified nuclei. Bioinformatic analysis suggested that the ANKRD55-protein partners from total protein extracts were related to nucleotide and ATP binding, enriched in nuclear transport terms and associated with cell cycle and RNA,  and amino  . The enrichment analysis of the ANKRD55-protein partners from nuclear extracts is related to sumoylation, RNA binding, processes associated with cell cycle, RNA transport, nucleotide and ATP binding. The interaction between overexpressed ANKRD55 isoform 001 and endogenous RPS3, the cohesins SMC1A and SMC3, CLTC, PRKDC, VIM, β-tubulin isoforms, and 14-3-3 isoforms were validated by western blot, reverse immunoprecipitaton and/or confocal microscopy. We also identified three phosphorylation sites in ANKRD55, with S436 exhibiting the highest score as likely 14-3-3 binding phosphosite. Our study suggests that ANKRD55 may exert function(s) in the formation or architecture of multiple protein complexes, and is regulated by (de)phosphorylation reactions. Based on interactome and subcellular localization analysis, ANKRD55 is likely transported into the nucleus by the classical nuclear import pathway and is involved in mitosis, probably via effects associated with mitotic spindle dynamics.Copyright © 2019 Ugidos, Mena, Baquero, Alloza, Azkargorta, Elortza and Vandenbroeck.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31620124>Altered  Tumor Environment and Its Potential Effects on NKT Cell Function in Tumor Immunity.</a></h1><p>Natural killer T (NKT) cells are CD1d restricted T cells that mostly recognize  antigens. These cells share characteristics with both adaptive and innate immune cells and have multiple immunoregulatory roles. In a manner similar to innate immune cells, they respond quickly to stimuli and secrete large amounts of cytokines, amplifying and modulating the immune response. As T cells, they express T cell receptors (TCRs) and respond in an antigen-specific manner like conventional T cells. There are at least two subtypes of NKT cells, type I and type II, that differ in the nature of their TCR, either semi-invariant (type I) or diverse (type II). The two sub-types generally have opposing functions in tumor immunity, with type I promoting and type II suppressing tumor immunity, and they cross-regulate each other, forming an immunoregulatory axis. The tumor has multiple mechanisms by which it can evade immune-surveillance. One such mechanism involves alteration in tumor  repertoire and accumulation of lipids and fatty  that favor tumor growth and evade anti-tumor immunity. Since NKT cells mostly recognize  antigens, an altered tumor  metabolic profile will also alter the repertoire of  antigens that can potentially affect their immune-modulatory function. In this review, we will explore the effects of alterations in the  metabolites on tumor growth, antigen cross-presentation, and overall effect on anti-tumor immunity, especially in the context of NKT cells.Copyright © 2019 Tiwary, Berzofsky and Terabe.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31640217>Characterization of  Profiles after Dietary Intake of Polyunsaturated Fatty  Using Integrated Untargeted and Targeted Lipidomics.</a></h1><p>Illuminating the comprehensive  profiles after dietary supplementation of polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFAs) is crucial to revealing the tissue distribution of PUFAs in living organisms, as well as to providing novel insights into .

Ligand binding to PTH1R involves binding to the large extracellular domain (ECD) and the orthosteric pocket, inducing conformational changes in the transmembrane domain and receptor activation. PTH1R regulates bone , signaling mainly through G and G G-proteins. Here, we used phage display to generate PTH1R ECD-specific antibodies with the aim of modulating receptor functionality. We identified ECD-scFvhFc, which exhibited high affinity binding to both the isolated ECD and to the full-length receptor in styrene-maleic  (SMA)  particles.

Recent studies have revealed an expanded range of roles played by FA in promoting the aggressiveness of cancer while simultaneously identifying new potential targets for cancer therapy. This article provides a brief review of these advances in our understanding of FA  in cancer, highlighting both recent discoveries and the inherent challenges caused by the metabolic plasticity of cancer cells in targeting  for cancer therapy.© The Author(s) 2019.

We evaluated the effects of whole-grain or refined cereals on fasting and postprandial serum adiponectin in people at high cardiovascular risk. According to a randomised controlled parallel group design, participants with metabolic syndrome were assigned to an isoenergetic diet based on either whole-grain cereal (WGC) or refined cereal (RC) products for 12-weeks. Anthropometric and biochemical measures were taken. Compared to baseline, fasting and postprandial serum adiponectin levels increased after both RC and WGC. In the WGC and RC groups combined, adiponectin concentrations significantly increased after 12-week intervention, and are directly associated with plasma SCFAs and acetate. Only increasing whole-grain cereals may not influence adiponectin levels, which could be modified by a fibre rich, low-, low-glycemic index diet, possibly through changes in gut microbiota, as suggested by the relation with SCFAs.

This study was conducted to determine whether alteration of  profiles and GB  may contribute to choline regulation and genotypic variations in salt tolerance in a halophytic grass, seashore paspalum (Paspalum vaginatum). Plants of Adalayd and Sea Isle 2000 were subjected to salt stress (200-mM NaCl) with or without foliar application of choline chloride (1 mM). Genotypic variations in salt tolerance and promotive effects of choline application on salt tolerance were associated with both the up-regulation of  and GB synthesis. The genotypic variations in salt tolerance associated with  were reflected by the differential accumulation of phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine between Adalayd and Sea Isle 2000. Choline-induced salt tolerance was associated with of the increase in digalactosyl diacylglycerol (DGDG) content including DGDG (36:4 and 36:6) in both cultivars of seashore paspalum and enhanced synthesis of phosphatidylinositol (34:2, 36:5, and 36:2) and phosphatidic  (34:2, 34:1, and 36:5), as well as increases in the ratio of digalactosyl diacylglycerol: monogalactosyl diacylglycerol (DGDG:MGDG) in salt-tolerant Sea Isle 2000. Choline regulation of salt tolerance may be due to the alteration in  in this halophytic grass species.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649558>Obesity Mediates Apoptosis and Extracellular Matrix Metabolic Imbalances via MAPK Pathway Activation in Intervertebral Disk Degeneration.</a></h1><p>Obesity may promote intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD) by non-mechanical means, by influencing levels of free fatty  which could impair cell . This study aims to establish metabolic factors in obesity-related IDD independent of mechanical loading. In clinical study, we retrospectively reviewed 128 volunteers (73 males, 55 females, aged 29-88 years) and compared their grades of disk degeneration with obesity-related factors such as body weight, BMI, and serum  levels. Clinically, the IDD group showed increased age, BMI and serum triglyceride. Triglyceride was a significant risk factor for IDD even after correction for BMI and age (P = 0.007). In obesity animal model, rats were fed a high- diet (HFD) in order to study its effects on disk  and apoptosis. HFD rats had significantly higher serum levels of lipids, including triglyceride and non-esterified fatty , and showed significantly decreased markers of anabolism, increased catabolism and apoptosis in disk. Finally, rat nucleus pulposus (NP) cells were stimulated  with a fatty  (palmitic , PA) to gauge its effects on cell  and apoptosis. Cell culture studies showed that NP cells exposed to PA showed increased apoptosis for activation of caspase 3, 7, 9, and PARP, which was primarily via the MAPK signal pathway, especially ERK pathway. In conclusion, hypertriglyceridemia can lead to IDD, independently of age and BMI. Hypertriglyceridemia appears to mediate disk cell apoptosis and matrix catabolism primarily via the ERK pathway.Copyright © 2019 Zhang, Chen, Huang, Wang, Shan, Liu, Chen, Li, Fan and Zhao.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31601483>Association between dyslipidemia and plasma levels of branched-chain amino  in the Japanese population without diabetes mellitus.</a></h1><p>Branched-chain amino  (BCAAs) play a key role in energy homeostasis.We aimed to investigate the association between plasma BCAA levels and dyslipidemia in the Japanese population without diabetes mellitus.This cross-sectional study included 4952 participants without diabetes mellitus, enrolled in the Tsuruoka Metabolomic Cohort Study. Plasma BCAA levels were measured by capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry. Correlations between  and BCAA profiles were evaluated by sex-stratified multiple linear regression analyses, after adjusting for confounders. Logistic regression was used to identify associations between BCAAs and metabolic dyslipidemia (MD) defined as triglyceride levels ≥150 mg/dL, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels ≤40 mg/dL for men and ≤50 mg/dL for women, or low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels ≥140 mg/dL.In both sexes, the levels of individual BCAAs and the total BCAA levels correlated positively with triglyceride levels and negatively with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. Valine, leucine, and total BCAA levels were weakly and positively correlated with LDL-C levels. Increased BCAA levels showed positive associations with MD. However, associations between BCAAs and elevated LDL-C levels were unclear. Furthermore, the associations between BCAA levels and MD regardless of fasting blood sugar (FBS) levels (high or low). Although valine, leucine, and total BCAA levels were weakly associated with elevated LDL-C levels in the high-FBS group, no such association was observed in the low-FBS group.BCAAs might be associated with MD independently of the FBS level and might play an important role in  and dyslipidemia.Copyright © 2019 National  Association.

In recent years, ITC has emerged as a powerful tool to characterise enzyme kinetics. In this study, we have adapted a single-injection method (SIM) to study the kinetics of human soluble epoxide hydrolase (hsEH), an enzyme involved in cardiovascular homeostasis, hypertension, nociception and insulin sensitivity through the  of epoxy-fatty  (EpFAs). In the SIM method, the rate of reaction is determined by monitoring the thermal power while the substrate is being depleted, overcoming the need for synthetic substrates, and reducing postreaction processing. Our results show that ITC enables the detailed, rapid and reproducible characterisation of the hsEH-mediated hydrolysis of several natural EpFA substrates. Furthermore, we have applied a variant of the single-injection ITC method for the detailed description of enzyme inhibition, proving the power of this approach in the rapid screening and discovery of new hsEH inhibitors using the enzyme's physiological substrates. The methods described herein will enable further studies on EpFAs  and biology, as well as drug discovery investigations to identify and characterise hsEH inhibitors. This also promises to provide a general approach for the characterisation of  catalysis, given the challenges that  studies pose to traditional spectroscopic techniques.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31639444>Production of conjugated fatty : A review of recent advances.</a></h1><p>Conjugated fatty  (CFAs) have received a deal of attention due to the increasing understanding of their beneficial physiological effects, especially the anti-cancer effects and -regulation activities. However, the production of CFAs is generally difficult. Several challenges are the low CFAs content in natural sources, the difficulty to chemically synthesize target CFA isomers in high purity, and the sensitive characteristics of CFAs. In this article, the current technologies to produce CFAs, including physical, chemical, and biotechnical approaches were summarized, with a focus on the conjugated linoleic  (CLAs) and conjugated linolenic  (CLNAs) which are the most common investigated CFAs. CFAs usually demonstrate stronger physiological effects than other non-conjugated fatty ; however, they are more sensitive to heat and oxidation. Consequently, the quality control throughout the entire production process of CFAs is significant. Special attention was given to the micro- or nano-encapsulation which presented as an emerging technique to improve the bioavailability and storage stability of CFAs. The current applications of CFAs and the potential research directions were also discussed.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

The goal of this study was to compare aspects of ROS  in response to O variability (6 hr hypoxia or hyperoxia, with subsequent normoxic recovery) in two species of intertidal sculpin fishes (Cottidae, Actinopterygii) that can experience O fluctuations in their natural environment and differ in whole animal hypoxia tolerance. To assess ROS , we measured the ratio of glutathione and glutathione disulfide as an indicator of tissue redox environment, MitoP/MitoB ratio to assess  mitochondrial ROS generation, thiobarbituric  reactive substances (TBARS) for  peroxidation, and total oxidative scavenging capacity (TOSC) in the liver, brain, and gill. In the brain, the more hypoxia tolerant  showed large increases in TBARS levels following hypoxia and hyperoxia exposure that were generally not associated with large changes in mitochondrial HO In contrast, the less-tolerant  showed no significant changes in TBARS or mitochondrial HO in the brain. More moderate responses were observed in the liver and gill of  exposed to hypoxia and hyperoxia with normoxic recovery, whereas  showed more responses to O variability in these tissues.

The enzyme glycine N-methyltransferase (GNMT), the most important enzyme implicated in S-adenosylmethionine catabolism in the liver, is downregulated during NAFLD progression. We have studied the mechanism involved in GNMT downregulation by its repressor microRNA miR-873-5p and the metabolic pathways affected in NAFLD as well as the benefit of recovery GNMT expression.miR-873-5p and GNMT expression were evaluated in liver biopsies of NAFLD/NASH patients. Different in vitro and in vivo NAFLD murine models were used to assess miR-873-5p/GNMT involvement in fatty liver progression through targeting of the miR-873-5p as NAFLD therapy.We describe a new function of GNMT as an essential regulator of Complex II activity in the electron transport chain in the mitochondria. In NAFLD, GNMT expression is controlled by miR-873-5p in the hepatocytes, leading to disruptions in mitochondrial functionality in a preclinical murine non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) model. Upregulation of miR-873-5p is shown in the liver of NAFLD/NASH patients, correlating with hepatic GNMT depletion. Importantly, NASH therapies based on anti-miR-873-5p resolve  accumulation, inflammation and fibrosis by enhancing fatty  β-oxidation in the mitochondria. Therefore, miR-873-5p inhibitor emerges as a potential tool for NASH treatment.GNMT participates in the regulation of metabolic pathways and mitochondrial functionality through the regulation of Complex II activity in the electron transport chain. In NAFLD, GNMT is repressed by miR-873-5p and its targeting arises as a valuable therapeutic option for treatment.Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier GmbH..

The mechanisms by which n-3 PUFA regulate biological processes begins with an understanding of the n-3 biosynthetic pathway that starts with alpha-linolenic  (18:3n-3) and is commonly thought to end with the production of docosahexaenoic  (DHA, 22:6n-3). However, our understanding of this pathway is not as complete as previously believed. In the current review we provide a background of the evidence supporting the pathway as currently understood and provide updates from recent studies challenging three central dogma of n-3 PUFA . By building on nearly three decades of research primarily in cell culture and oral dosing studies, recent evidence presented focuses on in vivo kinetic modelling and compound-specific isotope abundance studies in rodents and humans that have been instrumental in expanding our knowledge of the pathway. Specifically, we highlight three main updates to the n-3 PUFA biosynthesis pathway: (1) DHA synthesis rates cannot be as low as previously believed, (2) DHA is both a product and a precursor to tetracosahexaenoic  (24:6n-3) and (3) increases in EPA in response to DHA supplementation are not the result of increased retroconversion.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the impact of hyperthermia on the hepatic metabolome has hitherto not been investigated.In this study, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS)-based metabolomics was applied to assess the in vitro metabolic response of primary mouse hepatocytes (PMH,  = 10) to a heat stress stimulus, i.e., after 24 h exposure to 40.5 °C. Metabolomic profiling of both intracellular metabolites and volatile metabolites in the extracellular medium of PMH was performed.Multivariate analysis showed alterations in levels of 22 intra- and 59 extracellular metabolites, unveiling the capability of the metabolic pattern to discriminate cells exposed to heat stress from cells incubated at normothermic conditions (37 °C). Hyperthermia caused a considerable loss of cell viability that was accompanied by significant alterations in the tricarboxylic  cycle, amino  , urea cycle, glutamate , pentose phosphate pathway, and in the volatile signature associated with the  peroxidation process.These results provide novel insights into the mechanisms underlying hyperthermia-induced hepatocellular damage.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664805>The Role of Lipids in Hepatocellular Carcinoma.</a></h1><p>Hepatocellular carcinoma is the fastest growing cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, with few treatment options and a 70% recurrence rate. This trend is driven largely by the recent surge in incidence of metabolic syndrome, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.

Neoplastic cells are highly dependent on  as a source of energy and to support rapid cell division, and fatty  derivatives play key roles in cell signaling.

We hypothesize that the utilization of metabolomic techniques will allow for an improved understanding of the biochemical basis for the pharmacological activity of MTX, and can promote the identification and evaluation of novel molecular biomarkers of MTX response. In this work, erythroblastoid cells were exposed to MTX at the physiologic concentration of 1,000 nM and analyzed using three metabolomic platforms to give a broad spectrum of cellular metabolites. MTX pharmacological activity, defined as cellular growth inhibition, was associated with an altered cellular metabolomic profile based on the analysis of 724 identified metabolites. By discriminant analysis, MTX treatment was associated with increases in ketoisovaleric , fructose, galactose, and 2-deoxycytidine, and corresponding reductions in 2-deoxyuridine, phosphatidylinositol 32:0, orotic , and inosine monophosphate. Inclusion of data from analysis of folate  in combination with chemometric and metabolic network analysis demonstrated that MTX treatment is associated with dysregulated folate  and nucleotide biosynthesis, which is in line with its known mechanism of action. However, MTX treatment was also associated with alterations in a diversity of metabolites, including intermediates of amino , carbohydrate, and . Collectively, these findings support a robust metabolic response following exposure to physiologic concentrations of MTX. They also identify various metabolic intermediates that are associated with the pharmacological activity of MTX, and are, therefore, potential molecular biomarker candidates in future preclinical and clinical studies of MTX efficacy in autoimmune arthritis.© 2019 The Authors.

Secukinumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody that selectively neutralizes interleukin-17A (IL-17A), has shown significant and sustained efficacy in the treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis.This was an exploratory post hoc analysis of pooled data from three phase 3 studies in plaque psoriasis patient populations. The objective was to show the course of metabolic and liver parameters under secukinumab, etanercept, or placebo treatment over time. A further objective was to assess the impact of selected comorbidities and metabolic characteristics on high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), as a surrogate marker of systemic inflammation.Data from the phase 3 randomised controlled trials (FIXTURE [], ERASURE [], and SCULPTURE []; n=3010) were included in this analysis. Patients were treated with secukinumab 150 mg or 300 mg, placebo or etanercept 50 mg (FIXTURE only) as active comparator. A set of metabolic and liver parameters was longitudinally assessed over 52 weeks. Multivariate regression analyses assessed the impact of selected comorbidities and metabolic characteristics on hs-CRP levels at baseline and under treatment.Secukinumab treatment reduced hs-CRP levels. Body weight and uric  levels tended to decrease over 52 weeks with secukinumab. Secukinumab showed a neutral effect on fasting plasma glucose,  parameters and liver enzymes. Psoriatic arthritis, metabolic syndrome, obesity, impaired glucose , and hyperuricemia were each associated with increased hs-CRP levels at baseline. Concomitant obesity attenuated the decline in hs-CRP under treatment.These analyses suggest neutral to favourable long term trends in metabolic and liver parameters under secukinumab treatment. Metabolic comorbidities were associated with increased hs-CRP levels, reflecting the role of systemic inflammatory processes in their pathophysiology.© 2019 European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31602956>[Acute toxicity mechanism of Panax notoginseng saponins in larvae zebrafish based on metabonomics].</a></h1><p>Based on metabolomics,the metabolites of larvae zebrafish with overdose of Panax notoginseng saponins( PNS) were compared with those in normal group of larvae zebrafish to investigate the possible toxicity mechanism of overdose PNS in larvae zebrafish.

A portion of osteocalcin remains uncarboxylated (uncarboxylated osteocalcin, GluOC) that is released into blood where it functions as a hormone to regulate insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity. As insulin resistance is closely associated with metabolic syndrome, this study is aimed to elucidate how GluOC regulates glucose and  in KKAy mice, an animal model displaying obese, hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance, and hepatic steatosis. GluOC (3, 30 ng/g per day, ig) was orally administered to female KKAy mice for 4 weeks. Whole-body insulin sensitivity, glucose , hepatic steatosis, dyslipidemia were examined using routine laboratory assays. We found that GluOC administration significantly enhanced insulin sensitivity in KKAy mice by activating hepatic IRβ/PI3K/Akt pathway and elevated the whole-body insulin sensitivity with decreased FPI and HOMA-IR index. Furthermore, GluOC administration alleviated hyperglycemia through suppressing gluconeogenesis and promoting glycogen synthesis in KKAy mice and in cultured hepatocytes in vitro. Moreover, GluOC administration dose-dependently ameliorated dyslipidemia and attenuated hepatic steatosis in KKAy mice by inhibiting hepatic de novo lipogenesis and promoting fatty- β-oxidation. These results demonstrate that GluOC effectively enhances hepatic insulin sensitivity, improves hyperglycemia and ameliorates hepatic steatosis in KKAy mice, suggesting that GluOC could be a promising drug candidate for treating metabolic syndrome.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31609422>High- overfeeding does not exacerbate rapid changes in forearm glucose and fatty  balance during immobilization.</a></h1><p>Physical inactivity and high- overfeeding have been shown to independently induce insulin resistance.Establish the contribution of muscle disuse and  availability to the development of inactivity-induced insulin resistance. Design, setting, participants, and interventions: Twenty healthy males underwent seven days of forearm cast immobilization combined with a fully-controlled eucaloric (CON, n=10, age 23±2 yr, BMI 23.8±1.0 kg·m-2) or high- diet providing 50% excess energy from  (HFD, n=10, age 23±2 yr, BMI 22.4±0.8 kg·m-2).Prior to casting, and following 2 and 7 days of immobilization, forearm glucose uptake (FGU) and non-esterified fatty  (NEFA) balance were assessed using the arterialized venous-deep venous (AV-V) forearm balance method following ingestion of a mixed macronutrient drink.Seven days of HFD increased body weight by 0.9±0.2 kg (P=0.002), but did not alter fasting, arterialized whole-blood glucose and serum insulin concentrations or the associated HOMA-IR or Matsuda indices. Two and seven days of forearm immobilization led to a 40±7% and 52±7% decrease in FGU, respectively (P<0.001), with no difference between day 2 and 7 and no effect of HFD. Forearm NEFA balance tended to increase following two and seven days of immobilization (P=0.095).forearm immobilization leads to a rapid and substantial decrease in FGU, which is accompanied by an increase in forearm NEFA balance but is not exacerbated by excess dietary  intake. Altogether, our data suggest that disuse-induced insulin resistance of glucose  is occurs as a physiological adaptation in response to the removal of muscle contraction.© Endocrine Society 2019.

Chenodeoxycholic  (CDCA) is an end product in the human liver; however, mouse Cyp2c70 metabolizes CDCA to hydrophilic muricholic  (MCAs). Moreover, in humans the gut microbiota converts the primary BAs cholic  and CDCA into deoxycholic  (DCA) and lithocholic  (LCA), respectively. In contrast, the mouse Cyp2a12 reverts this action and converts these secondary BAs to primary BAs. Here we generated Cyp2a12 KO, Cyp2c70 KO and Cyp2a12/Cyp2c70 double knockout (DKO) mice using the CRISPR-Cas9 system to study the regulations of BA  under hydrophobic BA composition. Cyp2a12 KO mice showed the accumulation of DCAs, whereas Cyp2c70 KO mice lacked MCAs and exhibited markedly increased hepatobiliary proportions of CDCA. In DKO mice, not only DCAs or CDCAs but DCAs, CDCAs and LCAs were all elevated. In Cyp2c70 KO and DKO mice, chronic liver inflammation was observed depending on the hepatic unconjugated CDCA concentrations. The BA pool was markedly reduced in Cyp2c70 KO and DKO mice, but the farnesoid X receptor was not activated. It was suggested that the cytokine/c-Jun N-terminal kinase signaling pathway and the pregnane X receptor-mediated pathway are the predominant mechanisms, preferred over the FXR/SHP and FXR/FGF15 pathways, for controlling BA synthesis under hydrophobic BA composition. From our results, we hypothesize that these KO mice can be novel and useful models for investigating the roles of hydrophobic BAs in various human diseases.Published under license by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668396>PAR2 controls cholesterol homeostasis and  in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.</a></h1><p>Increases in hepatic and plasma cholesterol occur in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), although the reason for this is not well understood. We investigated whether Protease-Activated Receptor 2 (PAR2) plays a role in cholesterol and  homeostasis in NAFLD.Human liver biopsies (n = 108) were quantified for PAR2 expression from NAFLD cases randomly selected and stratified by liver fibrosis stage, the primary predictor for clinical outcomes, while controlling for age, gender, and BMI between fibrosis groups. Demographic data and laboratory studies on plasma samples were obtained within 6 months of liver biopsy. Wild-type and PAR2-KO (C57BL/6 F2rl1) mice were fed either normal or high  diet for 16 weeks and plasma and liver assayed for lipids and soluble metabolites.Severity of NAFLD and plasma cholesterol levels significantly correlated with hepatocyte PAR2 expression in NAFLD patients. Conversely, PAR2 deficiency in mice resulted in reduced expression of key hepatic genes involved in cholesterol synthesis, a 50% drop in plasma and total liver cholesterol, and induced a reverse cholesterol transport system that culminated in 25% higher fecal bile  output. PAR2-deficient mice exhibited enhanced fatty  β-oxidation with a ketogenic shift and an unexpected increase in liver glycogenesis. Mechanistic studies identified G-Jnk1/2 as key downstream effectors of protease-activated PAR2 in the regulation of  and cholesterol homeostasis in liver.These data indicate that PAR2 may be a new target for the suppression of plasma cholesterol and hepatic  accumulation in NAFLD and related metabolic conditions.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Skin represents the largest organ of the body that is exposed to  peroxidation. Previous studies have suggested the involvement of oxidative stress in the development of lichen planus (LP), a chronic inflammatory skin condition with a complex pathogenesis. The aim of our study is to investigate a panel of pro-oxidants (4-hydroxy-nonenal (4-HNE), thiobarbituric  reactive substances (TBARS), and malondialdehyde (MDA)), the total antioxidant status (TAS), and thiol-disulfide homeostasis parameters (TDHP), including total thiol (TT), native thiol (NT), disulfides (DS), DS/NT ratio, DS/TT ratio, and NT/TT ratio. The comparative determinations of serum levels of 4-HNE, TBARS, and MDA in patients with LP ( = 31) and controls ( = 26) show significant differences between the two groups (4-HNE: 7.81 ± 1.96 µg/mL vs. 6.15 ± 1.17 µg/mL,  < 0.05, TBARS: 4.23 ± 0.59 µmol/L vs. 1.99 ± 0.23 µmol/L,  < 0.05, MDA: 32.3 ± 6.26 ng/mL vs. 21.26 ± 2.36 ng/mL). The serum levels of TAS are lower in LP patients compared to the control group (269.83 ± 42.63 µmol/L vs. 316.46 ± 28.76 µmol/L,  < 0.05).

This work aims to characterize adipocyte phenotype and expression profile of genes in the regulation of  and glucose  in visceral adipose tissue and in skeletal muscle. From mating until weaning, a recommended dose of folic  for pregnancy (C, 2 mg of folic  per kg of diet) or a high folic  dose (HFA, 40 mg of folic  per kg of diet) was administered to Sprague-Dawley females. At 10 months of age progeny were divided into groups fed the standard chow (C/STD and HFA/STD) and groups fed the standard chow plus drinking water with 10% fructose (C/FRU and HFA/FRU), as an additional metabolic challenge. Adipocyte morphology and quantification of key genes involved in  and glucose  were studied in visceral adipose tissue and skeletal muscle of 13 months old offspring. HFA exposure led to an enlargement of visceral adipose cells most likely mediated by an upregulation of lipoprotein lipase, and it tended to downregulate Glut4 in visceral adipose tissue and skeletal muscle. Fructose exposure in a background of perigestational excess folic , but not in controls, induced an upregulation of lipogenesis pathway genes and it decreased jejunal expression of the proton-coupled folate transporter (Pcft1). In addition, fructose exposure led to a downregulation of jejunal Sglt1 in control animals. Our data suggest that high folic  exposure during the perigestational period caused morphologic and genic alterations related to insulin resistant states indicating that this intervention may act as an effective programmer of long-term metabolic dysfunction.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31607744>Berberine (BBR) Attenuated Palmitic  (PA)-Induced Lipotoxicity in Human HK-2 Cells by Promoting Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor α (PPAR-α).</a></h1><p>BACKGROUND Berberine (BBR), a natural alkaloid isolated from Coptis chinensis, has frequently been reported as an antidiabetic reagent, partly due to its -lowering activity. Evidence suggests that BBR ameliorates palmitate-induced  deposition and apoptosis in renal tubular epithelial cells (TECs), which tracks in tandem with the enhancement of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR-alpha). The study aim was to investigate the roles of BBR in renal lipotoxicity in vitro, and investigate whether PPAR-alpha was the underlying mechanism. MATERIAL AND METHODS Human TECs (HK-2 cells) were injured with palmitic  (PA), and then treated with BBR, BBR+PPAR-alpha inhibitor (GW6471), and PA+PPAR-alpha agonist (fenofibrate). Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress was assessed by measuring the expression of prospective evaluation of radial keratotomy (PERK), C/EBP-homologous protein (CHOP), and 78 kDa glucose-regulated protein (GRP78).  was assessed by determining  anabolism-associated genes, including fatty  synthase (FAS), acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), and lipoprotein lipase (LPL), as well as  catabolism-associated gene, including carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1 (CPT1). Inflammatory response of HK-2 cells was evaluated by measuring interleukin (IL)-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha. Cell apoptosis and protein levels of cleaved-caspase-3 were evaluated. RESULTS PA downregulated PPAR-alpha and induced server lipotoxicity in HK-2 cells by ER stress, increasing  deposition, and elevating inflammatory response of HK-2 cells accompanied with inducting cell apoptosis and cleaved-caspase-3, which were obviously reversed by additional treatment of BBR or PPAR-alpha agonist. However, the protective effect of BBR in PA-induced lipotoxicity in HK-2 cells was significantly ameliorated by PPAR-alpha inhibitor. CONCLUSIONS BBR attenuated PA-induced lipotoxicity via the PPAR-alpha pathway.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31621967>Fructose  as a common evolutionary pathway of survival associated with climate change, food shortage and droughts.</a></h1><p>Mass extinctions occur frequently in natural history. While studies of animals that became extinct can be informative, it is the survivors that provide clues for mechanisms of adaptation when conditions are adverse. Here, we describe a survival pathway used by many species as a means for providing adequate fuel and water, while also providing protection from a decrease in oxygen availability. Fructose, whether supplied in the diet (primarily fruits and honey), or endogenously (via activation of the polyol pathway), preferentially shifts the organism towards the storing of fuel (, glycogen) that can be used to provide energy and water at a later date. Fructose causes sodium retention and raises blood pressure and likely helped survival in the setting of dehydration or salt deprivation. By shifting energy production from the mitochondria to glycolysis, fructose reduced oxygen demands to aid survival in situations where oxygen availability is low. The actions of fructose are driven in part by vasopressin and the generation of uric . Twice in history, mutations occurred during periods of mass extinction that enhanced the activity of fructose to generate , with the first being a mutation in vitamin C  during the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction (65 million years ago) and the second being a mutation in uricase that occurred during the Middle Miocene disruption (12-14 million years ago). Today, the excessive intake of fructose due to the availability of refined sugar and high-fructose corn syrup is driving 'burden of life style' diseases, including obesity, diabetes and high blood pressure.© 2019 The Association for the Publication of the Journal of Internal Medicine.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31667852>Regulation mechanism of silkworm pupa oil PUFAs on cholesterol  in hepatic cell L-02.</a></h1><p>Silkworm Pupa Oil Polyunsaturated Fatty  (SPO PUFAs) has confirmed to have cholesterol-lowering function. Currently, SPO PUFAs and its main component α-Linolenic  (ALA) on regulation of cholesterol  was investigated.  denatured cell model was constructed by oleic  for  accumulation, cholesterol  and transformation. In addition, real-time PCR and western-blot were used to analyze the expression levels of related the genes and proteins for cholesterol efflux regulation mechanism investigation. The data indicated that SPO PUFAs and ALA dose-dependently decreased intracellular total cholesterol (TC), enhanced total bile  (TBA). Furthermore, SPO PUFAs and ALA could promote cholesterol removal through enhancing bile  secretion and up-regulating genes LXRα, PPARγ, ABCA1, ABCG1, and CYP7A1, which were regulated by LXRα/PPARγ-ABCA1/ABCG1-CYP7A1 nuclear receptor signal pathways.

BAs were well known for their requirement in dietary  absorption and biliary cholesterol secretion, due to their micelle-forming properties. However, it was not until 1999 that BAs were discovered to be endogenous ligands for the nuclear receptor FXR. Since that time, BAs have been shown to act through multiple receptors (PXR, VDR, TGR5 and S1PR2), as well as to have receptor-independent mechanisms (membrane dynamics, allosteric modulation of N-acyl phosphatidylethanolamine phospholipase D). We now also have an appreciation of the range of physiological, pathophysiological and therapeutic conditions in which endogenous BAs are altered, raising the possibility that BAs contribute to the effects of these conditions on glycaemia. In this Review, we highlight the mechanisms by which BAs regulate glucose homeostasis and the settings in which endogenous BAs are altered, and provide suggestions for future research.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31627245>Bioconcentration,  and spatial distribution of  C-labelled laurate in the freshwater amphipod Hyalella Azteca.</a></h1><p>regulatory assessment of the bioaccumulation from water is commonly based on bioconcentration factors (BCF) derived from fish flow-through tests. Such experiments require many laboratory animals and are time-consuming and costly. An alternative test set-up for organic, neutral compounds using the amphipod Hyalella azteca was recently suggested, resulting in BCF values, which show a strong correlation with fish BCF data. In the present study, the bioconcentration potential of the ionic compound laurate was elucidated in H. Azteca. The sodium salt of 1- C laurate was applied to H. azteca in a flow-through and a semi-static approach. Due to rapid biodegradation, a semi-static approach with frequent media replacements was required to ensure stable media concentration. Laurate was also rapidly metabolised by H. azteca. A large proportion of the total radioactivity measured in the amphipod tissue was not extractable suggesting that mineralised laurate was accumulated in the calcified exoskeleton of H. azteca. This was confirmed in a further study using carbonate [ C]. A  normalised (5.0 %) Hyalella BCF of 8.9 was calculated for laurate, measured as free fatty . The results of the bioconcentration studies with H. azteca confirm the low bioaccumulation potential of the test item previously observed in fish. However, more organic ionic compounds with various properties need to be tested to assess whether a general correlation between fish and Hyalella BCF data exists.

The CBS-containing serum of mice was obtained by serum pharmacology method to evaluate its effect on the proliferation of LO2 hepatocytes. The  reducing effects of CBS-containing serum through Nrf2 was evaluated by fructose-induced LO2 hepatocyte steatosis model,nuclear factor erythroid 2 related factor 2( Nrf2) agonist oltipraz combined intervention,cell oil red O staining and intracellular triglyceride( TG) content. The effects of CBS-containing serum on  peroxidation and hepatocytes apoptosis were evaluated by reactive oxygen species( ROS) and apoptosis assay,respectively. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction( PCR) was used to detect the relative expression of  synthesis-related genes and apoptosis-related genes.RESULTS:: showed that CBS drug-containing serum had no significant effect on LO2 hepatocyte proliferation. As compared with the model group,CBS-containing serum could effectively reduce the formation of  droplets in fructose-induced LO2 hepatocytes,significantly reduce intracellular TG and ROS levels,and significantly reduce hepatocyte apoptosis rate( P < 0. 05). As compared with the model group,carbohydrate responsive element binding protein( ChREBP),sterol regulatory element binding protein-1 c( SREBP-1 c),fatty  synthase( FAS),acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1( ACC1),stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1( SCD1),Bax and caspase-3 mRNA levels were significantly reduced in CBS drug-containing serum treatment group( P<0. 05). All of the above effects could be reversed by oltipraz.In conclusion,CBS-containing serum can significantly inhibit the fructose-induced LO2 liver  deposition,and the mechanism may be related to reducing intracellular ROS level through the Nrf2 pathway and improving intracellular peroxidation state to reduce apoptosis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669116>The association of short-chain fatty  and leptin : a systematic review.</a></h1><p>The purpose of this systematic review is to analyze the available evidence linking short-chain fatty  (SCFA) to leptin's levels and production. We performed a systematic review using the PubMed/Medline database including primary articles written in English that measured leptin production or levels as well as SCFA used as an intervention, mechanism or outcome. The search yielded a total of 573 citations; 36 studies were included in the final analysis. The quality of the studies was analyzed through two validated tools based on objective criteria. Overall, the studies presented low risk of bias to construct and statistical validity. However, the majority presented a high risk of attrition and detection bias. In vitro studies (n = 8) consistently demonstrated that SCFA stimulate leptin expression in adipocytes through activation of free fatty  receptor 3 (FFAR3). In animal studies (n = 24), interventions to modulate high- diet outcomes predominantly caused a decrease in circulating leptin levels and increased SCFA, associated with suppressed weight gain. Control of dysbiosis through administration of prebiotics and probiotics also played a role in leptin synthesis in animal studies. In human studies (n = 4) leptin was mainly correlated with adiposity but dysbiosis interfered with this relationship. We conclude that the association between SCFA and leptin remains incompletely understood but occurs mainly through the activation of FFAR3 in adipocytes. However, body  rather than SCFA remains the main driver for leptin synthesis in vivo. Future studies should aim to better clarify the role of SCFA in regulating leptin production in vivo.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

There are no large-scale international studies on drug use in neonatal units. Objective We aimed to describe drug use in European neonatal units and characterize its associations with geographic region and gestational age. Setting A one-day point prevalence study was performed as part of the European Study of Neonatal Exposure to Excipients from January to June 2012. Method All neonatal prescriptions and demographic data were registered in a web-based database. The impact of gestational age and region on prescription rate were analysed with logistic regression. Main outcome measure The number and variety of drugs prescribed to hospitalized neonates in different gestational age groups and geographic regions. Results In total, 21 European countries with 89 neonatal units participated. Altogether 2173 prescriptions given to 726 neonates were registered. The 10 drugs with the highest prescription rate were multivitamins, vitamin D, caffeine, gentamicin, amino  for parenteral nutrition, phytomenadione, ampicillin, benzylpenicillin,  emulsion for parenteral nutrition and probiotics. The six most commonly prescribed ATC groups (alimentary tract and , blood and blood-forming organs, systemic anti-infectives, nervous, respiratory and cardiovascular system) covered 98% of prescriptions. Gestational age significantly affected the use of all commonly used drug groups. Geographic region influenced the use of alimentary tract and , blood and blood-forming organs, systemic anti-infectives, nervous and respiratory system drugs. Conclusion While gestational age-dependent differences in neonatal drug use were expected, regional variations (except for systemic anti-infectives) indicate a need for cooperation in developing harmonized evidence-based guidelines and suggest priorities for collaborative work.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31658693>Systemic Metabolomic Profiling of Acute Myeloid Leukemia Patients before and During Disease-Stabilizing Treatment Based on All-Trans Retinoic , Valproic , and Low-Dose Chemotherapy.</a></h1><p>Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is an aggressive malignancy, and many elderly/unfit patients cannot receive intensive and potentially curative therapy. These patients receive low-toxicity disease-stabilizing treatment. The combination of all-trans retinoic  (ATRA) and the histone deacetylase inhibitor valproic  can stabilize the disease for a subset of such patients. We performed untargeted serum metabolomic profiling for 44 AML patients receiving treatment based on ATRA and valproic  combined with low-dose cytotoxic drugs (cytarabine, hydroxyurea, 6-mercaptopurin) which identified 886 metabolites. When comparing pretreatment samples from responders and non-responders, metabolites mainly belonging to amino  and  (i.e., fatty ) pathways were altered. Furthermore, patients with rapidly progressive disease showed an extensively altered . Both ATRA and valproic  monotherapy also altered the amino  and  metabolite profiles; however, these changes were only highly significant for valproic  treatment. Twenty-three metabolites were significantly altered by seven-day valproic  treatment ( < 0.05,  < 0.05), where the majority of altered metabolites belonged to  (especially fatty  ) and amino  pathways, including several carnitines. These metabolomic effects, and especially the effects on , may be important for the antileukemic and epigenetic effects of this treatment.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31635131>Impact of High Salt Diet on Cerebral Vascular Function and Stroke in C57BL/6N Knockout and WT (C57BL/6N) Control Mice.</a></h1><p>High salt (HS) dietary intake leads to impaired vascular endothelium-dependent responses to various physiological stimuli, some of which are mediated by arachidonic  (AA) metabolites. Transgenic  gene knockout mice (C57BL/6N) have changes in  which may affect vascular function and outcomes of stroke. We aimed to study the effects of one week of HS diet (4% NaCl) on vascular function and stroke induced by transient occlusion of middle cerebral artery in  and wild type (WT/C57BL/6N) mice. Flow-induced dilation (FID) of carotid artery was reduced in WT-HS mice, but not affected in HS mice. Nitric oxide (NO) mediated FID. NO production was decreased with HS diet. On the contrary, acetylcholine-induced dilation was significantly decreased in  mice on both diets and WT-HS mice. HS intake and  gene depletion affected the structural components of the vessels. Proteomic analysis revealed a significant effect of  gene deficiency on HS diet-induced changes in neuronal structural proteins and acute innate immune response proteins' expression and  depletion, but HS diet did not increase the stroke volume, which is related to proteome modification and upregulation of genes involved mainly in cellular antioxidative defense. In conclusion,  depletion seems to partially impair vascular function and worsen the outcomes of stroke, which is moderately affected by HS diet.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31586394>The MetaCyc database of metabolic pathways and enzymes-a 2019 update.</a></h1><p>MetaCyc (MetaCyc.org) is a comprehensive reference database of metabolic pathways and enzymes from all domains of life.

Microenvironmental oxygen, glucose, and glutamine are regarded as principal nutrients fueling tumor growth. However, hostile tumor microenvironments render O/nutrient supplies chronically insufficient for increased proliferation rates, forcing cancer cells to develop strategies for opportunistic modes of nutrient acquisition. Recent work shows that cancer cells overcome this nutrient scarcity by scavenging other substrates, such as proteins and lipids, or utilizing adaptive metabolic pathways. As such, reprogramming  plays important roles in providing energy, macromolecules for membrane synthesis, and -mediated signaling during cancer progression. In this review, we highlight more recently appreciated roles for lipids, particularly cholesterol and its derivatives, in cancer cell  within intrinsically harsh tumor microenvironments.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

We identified 3-hydroxyanthranilic  (3-HAA) as a key metabolite of Trp modulating vascular inflammation and . The molecular mechanisms driven by 3-HAA in atherosclerosis have not been completely elucidated. In this study, we investigated whether two major signalling pathways, activation of SREBPs and inflammasome, are associated with the 3-HAA-dependent regulation of lipoprotein synthesis and inflammation in the atherogenesis process. Moreover, we examined whether inhibition of endogenous 3-HAA degradation affects hyperlipidaemia and atherosclerosis.In vitro, we showed that 3-HAA reduces SREBP-2 expression and nuclear translocation, and apolipoprotein B secretion in HepG2 cell cultures, and inhibits inflammasome activation and IL-1β production by macrophages. Using Ldlr-/- mice, we showed that inhibition of 3-hydroxyanthranilic  3,4-dioxygenase (HAAO), which increases the endogenous levels of 3-HAA, decreases atherosclerosis and plasma lipids. Notably, HAAO inhibition led to decreased hepatic SREBP-2 mRNA levels and  accumulation, and improved liver pathology scores.We discovered that the activity of SREBP-2 and the inflammasome can be regulated by 3-HAA . Moreover, our study highlights that targeting HAAO is a promising strategy to prevent and treat hypercholesterolemia and atherosclerosis.Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease driven by maladaptive immune responses in the artery wall. Novel insights into cellular processes driving immune cell activation revealed that intracellular metabolic pathways regulate immune cell functions and inflammation. Thus, our present work identifies 3-Hydroxyanthranilate 3,4-Dioxygenase (HAAO) and promising immunometabolic target to combat atherosclerotic CVD. Importantly, our findings indicate targeting tryptophan  offers the possibility affect both  and vascular inflammation in the course of disease.

These FAs are intracellularly converted into triglyceride (TG) molecules, before they are packaged into chylomicrons for transport to the lymph or into cytosolic  droplets (LDs) for intracellular storage. A crucial step for the formation of LDs is the catalytic activity of diacylglycerol acyltransferases (DGAT) in the final step of TG synthesis. LDs are important to buffer toxic  species and regulate cellular  in different cell types. Since the human intestinal epithelium is regularly confronted with high concentrations of lipids, LD formation is of great importance to regulate homeostasis. Here we describe a simple assay for the characterization and quantification of LD formation (LDF) upon stimulation with the most common unsaturated fatty , oleic , in human intestinal organoids. The LDF assay is based on the LD-specific fluorescent dye LD540, which allows for quantification of LDs by confocal microscopy, fluorescent plate reader, or flow cytometry. The LDF assay can be used to characterize LD formation in human intestinal epithelial cells, or to study human (genetic) disorders that affect LD , such as DGAT1 deficiency. Furthermore, this assay can also be used in a high-throughput pipeline to test novel therapeutic compounds, which restore defects in LD formation in intestinal or other types of organoids.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31637783>Influence of mastitis metritis agalactia (MMA) on bone and .</a></h1><p>Mastitis metritis agalactia (MMA) is a common disease in post-partum sows and has a negative effect on sows' longevity as well as on sows' and piglets' health. MMA leads to an inflammatory state. The aim was to investigate the impact of MMA on bone and . The hypothesis was that it is possible to predict MMA by measuring ketone bodies and bone markers. Blood samples from 175 sows were taken within 72 hr after farrowing. Serum was analysed for 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-(OH)-D), serum crosslaps (CTX-I), osteocalcin (OC), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), phosphorus (P), parathyroid hormone (PTH), triglycerides (TG), beta-hydroxybutyric  (BHB), tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and haptoglobin. Spontaneous urine was collected, and pH value was measured in addition to Ca and P. A proximate analysis of the sows' diets was performed. Age, litter size, body condition score (BCS) and clinical signs of MMA were recorded for each sow. A multivariable logistic regression was undertaken with disease status (MMA or healthy) as the dependent variable. Significance was accepted at p < .05. MMA sows had a poorer BCS (p < .001) in relation to healthy sows. Age and number of piglets did not differ. MMA sows showed increased serum CTX-I (p = .004) and decreased serum OC (p < .001). Concentrations of P (p = .007), activity of ALP (p = .002) and BHB (p = .019) as well as TNF-α (p < .001) and haptoglobin (p = .048) concentrations were increased in MMA sows. No difference in urinary pH value between MMA and healthy sows was found. Our results are in accordance with the known fact that sows are in an extreme catabolic state peripartum. Bone  in MMA sows is much more negatively affected than in healthy sows post-partum, due to inflammatory processes shown by higher concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines.© 2019 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31616017>Short-term effects of Vertical sleeve gastrectomy and Roux-en-Y gastric bypass on glucose homeostasis.</a></h1><p>The objective of this study was to compare the biochemical changes related to glucose tolerance and  in non-diabetic patients shortly after vertical sleeve gastrectomy (SG) or Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). Non-diabetic women and men with morbid obesity were studied the day before and six days after SG (N = 15) or RYGB (N = 16). Patients completed an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT; 75 g glucose) at both visits. SG and RYGB similarly improved fasting glucose homeostasis six days after surgery, with reduced glucose and insulin concentrations. The OGTT revealed differences between the two surgery groups that were not evident from the fasting serum concentrations. Postprandial (120 min) glucose and insulin concentrations were lower after RYGB but not after SG, whereas concentrations of glucagon-like peptide-1, peptide YY, glucagon and non-esterified fatty  were elevated after both SG and RYGB. Fasting triacylglycerol concentration did not change after surgery, but concentrations of high density lipoprotein and low density lipoprotein cholesterols were reduced in both surgery groups, with no differences between the groups. To conclude, RYGB induced a more pronounced improvement in postprandial glucose homeostasis relative to SG, possibly due to improved insulin sensitivity rather than augmented insulin concentration.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31669589>VDR regulates energy  by modulating remodeling in adipose tissue.</a></h1><p>Vitamin D receptor (VDR) plays an important role in regulating energy . Adipose tissue is a vital metabolic organ in energy balance and glucose homeostasis. In this study, we investigated the role of VDR expressed on adipose tissue in the balance of energy . This study was conducted in VDR-KO mice, VDR-Tg mice and wild-type mice. Energy  was determined based on the energy expenditure, oxygen consumption, respiratory exchange rate, food and water intake, and a cool room test. VDR expression in the tissues of VDR-Tg mice was assessed by western blotting. The levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides, free fatty , leptin, and glucose were assessed using the respective kits. Insulin resistance in the whole body was evaluated by an intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test and insulin tolerance test. mRNA associated with energy  expression in adipose and skeletal muscle tissue was examined by RT-PCR. Our results show that overexpression of VDR in adipose tissue induced an increase in body weight,  mass, and serum  levels, and a decline in energy ; these changes were ameliorated by VDR-KO mice. Overexpression of VDR in the adipose tissue of VDR-Tg mice induced a state of insulin resistance, which corresponded with decreased expression of UCP1, UCP2, UCP3, CPT2 and HK in both white adipose tissue and brown adipose tissue; these changes were also reversed by VDR-KO mice. Our study confirms that expression levels of VDR in adipose tissue play pivotal roles in energy balance and glycolipid  by regulating adipose tissue remodeling.Copyright © 2019.

Across all groups, mtDNA positively correlated with ISI (P < 0.001; r = 0.688) and V̇O (normalised to free  mass; r = 0.684, P < 0.001), and negatively correlated to HOMA-IR (r = -0.544, P < 0.01). The activity of mitochondrial enzymes (GluDH, CS and β-HAD) was greater in NSC than ST2DM (P < 0.01, P < 0.001 and P < 0.05) and SC (P < 0.05, P < 0.01 and P < 0.05), but similar between ST2DM and SC. Intramuscular-free fatty , triglycerides and malondialdehyde contents were similar between ST2DM and SC.Body composition and indices of muscle mitochondrial volume/function were similar between SC and ST2DM. However, mtDNA differed and was positively associated with ISI, HOMA-IR and V̇O across all groups. Collectively, the findings support the contention that habitual physical activity is a key component of T2DM development, possibly by influencing mtDNA.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652245>Exercise Effects on Mitochondrial Function and  during Energy Balance.</a></h1><p>Aerobic exercise training (AET) has been shown to improve mitochondrial bioenergetics and upregulate proteins related to . However, it remains to be determined if these alterations associated with AET persist when measured in energy balance (EB) in the days following the last bout of training. . The purpose of the study was to test the hypothesis that improvements in skeletal muscle mitochondrial function induced by AET observed in previous literature would persist when measured after restoring EB conditions 72 hours removed from the last exercise bout.Participants were 14 premenopausal women (age = 31.2 ± 6.7 years, BMI = 26.6 ± 5.1 kg/m). The AET program required 3 monitored training sessions per week for 8-16 weeks. Skeletal muscle biopsies were obtained at baseline and following 8-16 weeks of AET (≥72 hrs after the last exercise bout). All food was provided for 72 hours prior to biopsies and EB was managed 24 hours prior to testing within ±100 kcal of measured energy requirements using a whole-room calorimeter. Mitochondrial oxidative capacity was quantified in permeabilized muscle fibers from the vastus lateralis.We found that AET increased coupled respiration (154%) and uncoupled respiration (90%) rates using a fatty  substrate (palmitoyl carnitine) (P<0.05). However, when rates were normalized to complex IV activity (a marker of mitochondrial content), no significant differences were observed. Additionally, there were no changes in proteins known to mediate mitochondrial biogenesis or  transport and  following AET.8-16 weeks of AET improved mitochondrial capacity under fatty  substrate when assessed in EB, which appears to be due to mitochondrial biogenesis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31640132>Effects of Dietary Supplementation of Alpha-Ketoglutarate in a Low-Protein Diet on Fatty  Composition and  Related Gene Expression in Muscles of Growing Pigs.</a></h1><p>The aim of the current study was to investigate whether dietary supplementation with alpha-ketoglutarate (AKG) in a reduced crude protein (CP) diet would affect fatty  composition and  related gene expression in the muscles of growing pigs. A total of 27 Large White × Landrace growing pigs at 44 ± 1 d of age (11.96 ± 0.18 kg) were randomly allocated to three treatments ( = 9). Dietary treatments included: (1) normal protein diet with 20% crude protein (CP) (NP); (2) a low crude protein diet formulated to contain approximately 17% CP (LP); and (3) a low crude protein diet with 17% CP supplemented with 1% AKG at the expense of regular corn components (ALP). The experimental trial lasted 35 d. The results showed that compared with the NP and LP diets, supplementation with AKG in a low-protein diet increased the intramuscular  (IMF), oleic  (C18:1n-9), and monounsaturated fatty  (MUFA) contents ( < 0.05), and tended to increase the percentage of palmitoleic  (C16:1) and stearic  (C18:0) ( < 0.10) in the biceps femoris and longissimus dorsi muscles of growing pigs. These effects may be associated with increased relative mRNA expression levels of fatty  synthase (FAS), acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), adipocyte determination and differentiation factor 1 (ADD1), fatty  binding protein 4 (FABP4), and stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD) in skeletal muscle, indicating that AKG might be involved in the differential regulation of some key lipogenic genes in skeletal muscles of pigs.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31624846>AKINβ1, a regulatory subunit of SnRK1, regulates organic   and acts as a global regulator of genes involved in carbon,  and nitrogen .</a></h1><p>The Sucrose Non-fermenting-1-Related Protein Kinase 1 (SnRK1) is a highly conserved heterotrimeric protein kinase in plants. It possesses a catalytic subunit (α) and two regulatory subunits (β and γ). The effects of altered expression of AKINβ1 on carbohydrate  and gene expression in leaves were investigated in an Arabidopsis T-DNA insertion mutant. The contents of key intermediates in the tricarboxylic  (TCA) cycle of the mutant leaves were markedly reduced throughout the diurnal cycle, coupled with a decrease in measurable respiration rate. Compared to wild-type, 2485 genes and 188 genes were expressed differentially in leaves of the akinβ1 mutant in response to light and darkness respectively. Among these, several genes exhibited very substantial decreases in expression. Notably, expression of particular isoforms of multigene families involved in malate and , and nitrate uptake showed decreases of 40-240 fold during the light period, but not during darkness. The subcellular localization of AKINβ1 and the regulatory function of N-myristoylation on the subcellular localization of AKINβ1 were investigated, showing that AKINβ1 localizes to Golgi. A model is hypothesized to explain the effects of AKINβ1 on  and gene expression in Arabidopsis.© The Author(s) 2019.

A systemic view of the metabolic pathways underlying glioblastoma cell functioning states is lacking. We analyzed public single cell RNA-sequencing data from glioblastoma surgical resections, which offer the closest available view of tumor cell heterogeneity as encountered at the time of patients' diagnosis. Unsupervised analyses revealed that information dispersed throughout the cell transcript repertoires encoded the identity of each tumor and masked information related to cell functioning states. Data reduction based on an experimentally-defined signature of transcription factors overcame this hurdle. It allowed cell grouping according to their tumorigenic potential, regardless of their tumor of origin. The approach relevance was validated using independent datasets of glioblastoma cell and tissue transcriptomes, patient-derived cell lines and orthotopic xenografts. Overexpression of genes coding for amino  and  enzymes involved in anti-oxidative, energetic and cell membrane processes characterized cells with high tumorigenic potential. Modeling of their expression network highlighted the very long chain polyunsaturated fatty  synthesis pathway at the core of the network. Expression of its most downstream enzymatic component, ELOVL2, was associated with worsened patient survival, and required for cell tumorigenic properties in vivo. Our results demonstrate the power of signature-driven analyses of single cell transcriptomes to obtain an integrated view of metabolic pathways at play within the heterogeneous cell landscape of patient tumors.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31605240>Elevated serum ceramides are linked with obesity-associated gut dysbiosis and impaired glucose .</a></h1><p>Low gut microbiome richness is associated with dyslipidemia and insulin resistance, and ceramides and other sphingolipids are implicated in the development of diabetes.Determine whether circulating sphingolipids, particularly ceramides, are associated with alterations in the gut microbiome among obese patients with increased diabetes risk.This was a cross-sectional and longitudinal retrospective analysis of a dietary/weight loss intervention. Fasted serum was collected from 49 participants (41 women) and analyzed by HPLC-MS/MS to quantify 45 sphingolipids. Shotgun metagenomic sequencing of stool was performed to profile the gut microbiome.Confirming the link to deteriorated glucose homeostasis, serum ceramides were positively correlated with fasting glucose, but inversely correlated with fasting and OGTT-derived measures of insulin sensitivity and β-cell function. Significant associations with gut dysbiosis were demonstrated, with SM and ceramides being inversely correlated with gene richness. Ceramides with fatty  chain lengths of 20-24 carbons were the most associated with low richness. Diet-induced weight loss, which improved gene richness, decreased most sphingolipids. Thirty-one MGS, mostly corresponding to unidentified bacteria species, were inversely correlated with ceramides, including a number of Bifidobacterium and Methanobrevibacter smithii. Higher ceramide levels were also associated with increased metagenomic modules for lipopolysaccharide synthesis and flagellan synthesis, two pathogen-associated molecular patterns, and decreased enrichment of genes involved in methanogenesis and bile  .This study identifies an association between gut microbiota richness, ceramides, and diabetes risk in overweight/obese humans, and suggests that the gut microbiota may contribute to dysregulation of  in metabolic disorders.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31648395>Concise review: Aberrant  as an emerging therapeutic strategy to target cancer stem cells.</a></h1><p>Emerging evidences in cancer metabolomics have identified reprogrammed metabolic pathways to be a major hallmark of cancer, among which deregulated  is a prominent field receiving increasing attention. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) comprise <0.1% of the tumor bulk and possess high self-renewal, tumor initiating properties, and are responsible for therapeutic resistance, disease recurrence, and tumor metastasis. Hence, it is imperative to understand the metabolic rewiring occurring in CSCs, especially their , on which there have been recent reports. CSCs rely highly upon  for maintaining their stemness properties and fulfilling their biomass and energy demands, ultimately leading to cancer growth and invasion. Hence, in this review we will shed light on the aberrant  that CSCs exploit to boost their survival, which comprises upregulation in de novo lipogenesis,  droplet synthesis,  desaturation, and β-oxidation. Furthermore, the metabolic regulators involved in the process, such as key lipogenic enzymes, are also highlighted. Finally, we also summarize the therapeutic strategies targeting the key regulators involved in CSCs' , which thereby demonstrates the potential to develop powerful and novel therapeutics against the CSC  metabolome.

To investigate the underlying systems biology of Allo action in AD models in vivo, we assessed the regulation of Allo on the bioenergetic system of the brain. Outcomes of these analysis indicated that Allo significantly reversed deficits in mitochondrial respiration and biogenesis and key mitochondrial enzyme activity and reduced  peroxidation in the 3xTgAD mice in vivo. To explore the mechanisms by which Allo regulates the brain , we conducted targeted transcriptome analysis. These data further confirmed that Allo upregulated genes involved in glucose , mitochondrial bioenergetics, and signaling pathways while simultaneously downregulating genes involved in Alzheimer's pathology, fatty  , and mitochondrial uncoupling and dynamics. Upstream regulatory pathway analysis predicted that Allo induced peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARG) and coactivator 1-alpha (PPARGC1A) pathways while simultaneously inhibiting the presenilin 1 (PSEN 1), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) pathways to reduce AD pathology. Collectively, these data indicate that Allo functions as a systems biology regulator of bioenergetics, cholesterol homeostasis, and β-amyloid reduction in the brain. These systems are critical to neurological health, thus providing a plausible mechanistic rationale for Allo as a therapeutic to promote neural cell function and reduce the burden of AD pathology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31636850>Intracutaneous Delivery of Gelatins Reduces  Accumulation in Subcutaneous Adipose Tissue.</a></h1><p>Subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) accumulation is a constitutional disorder resulting from metabolic syndrome. Although surgical and non-surgical methods for reducing SAT exist, patients remain non-compliant because of potential adverse effects and cost. In this study, we developed a new minimally-invasive approach to achieve SAT reduction, using a microneedle (MN) patch prepared from gelatin, which is capable of regulating . Four gelatin types were used: three derived from fish (SA-FG, GT-FG 220, and GT-FG 250), and one from swine (SM-PG 280). We applied gelatin-based MN patches five times over 4 weeks to rats with high- diet (HD)-induced obesity, and determined the resulting amount of SAT. We also investigated the histological features and determined the expression levels of -associated genes in SAT using hematoxylin and eosin staining and western blotting, respectively. SAT decreased following treatment with all four gelatin MN patches. Smaller adipocytes were observed in the regions treated with SA-FG, GT-FG 250, and SM-PG 280 MNs, demonstrating a decline in  accumulation. The expression levels of -associated genes in the MN-treated SAT revealed that GT-FG 220 regulates fatty  synthase (FASN) protein levels. These findings suggest that gelatin MN patches aid in decreasing the quantity of unwanted SAT by altering  and  deposition.Copyright © 2019 The Korean Society Of Toxicology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31597940>Crosstalk between protein N-glycosylation and  in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.</a></h1><p>The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a multi functional organelle and plays a crucial role in protein folding and  biosynthesis. The SEC59 gene encodes dolichol kinase, required for protein glycosylation in the ER. The mutation of sec59-1 caused a protein N-glycosylation defect mediated ER stress resulting in increased levels of phospholipid, neutral  and sterol, whereas growth was reduced. In the sec59-1∆ cell, the N-glycosylation of vacuolar carboxy peptidase-Y (CPY) was significantly reduced; whereas the ER stress marker Kar2p and unfolded protein response (UPR) were significantly increased. Increased levels of Triacylglycerol (TAG), sterol ester (SE), and  droplets (LD) could be attributed to up-regulation of DPP1, LRO1, and ARE2 in the sec 59-1∆ cell. Also, the diacylglycerol (DAG), sterol (STE), and free fatty  (FFA) levels were significantly increased, whereas the genes involved in peroxisome biogenesis and Pex3-EGFP levels were reduced when compared to the wild-type. The microarray data also revealed increased expression of genes involved in phospholipid, TAG, fatty , sterol synthesis, and phospholipid transport resulting in dysregulation of  homeostasis in the sec59-1∆ cell.

In atherosclerosis this is associated with dyslipidemia and oxidative stress, but mechanisms linking these phenomena to macrophage activation remain incompletely understood.  To investigate mechanisms linking dyslipidemia, oxidative stress and macrophage activation through modulation of immunemetabolism, and to explore therapeutic potential targeting specific metabolic pathways.  Using a combination of biochemical, immunological, and ex vivo cell metabolic studies, we report that CD36 mediates a mitochondrial metabolic switch from oxidative phosphorylation to superoxide production in response to its ligand, oxLDL. Mitochondrial-specific inhibition of superoxide inhibited oxLDL-induced NF-κB activation and inflammatory cytokine generation. RNAseq, flow cytometry, H-labeled palmitic  uptake, lipidomic analysis, confocal and EM imaging, and functional energetics revealed that oxLDL upregulated effectors of long-chain fatty  (FA) uptake and mitochondrial import, while downregulating FA oxidation and inhibiting ATP5A, an electron transport chain (ETC) component. The combined effect is long-chain FA accumulation, alteration of mitochondrial structure and function, repurposing of the ETC to superoxide production, and NF-κB activation. Apoe null mice challenged with high  diet showed similar metabolic changes in circulating Ly6C monocytes and peritoneal macrophages, along with increased CD36 expression. Moreover, mitochondrial ROS was positively correlated with CD36 expression in aortic lesional macrophages.  These findings reveal that oxLDL/CD36 signaling in macrophages links dys-regulated FA  to oxidative stress from the mitochondria, which drives chronic inflammation. Thus, targeting to CD36 and its downstream effectors may serve as potential new strategies against chronic inflammatory diseases such as atherosclerosis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672551>Fasting reveals largely intact systemic  mobilization mechanisms in respiratory chain complex III deficient mice.</a></h1><p>Mice homozygous for the human GRACILE syndrome mutation (Bcs1l) display decreased respiratory chain complex III activity, liver dysfunction, hypoglycemia, rapid loss of white adipose tissue and early death. To assess the underlying mechanism of the lipodystrophy in homozygous mice (Bcs1l), these and wild-type control mice were subjected to a short 4-hour fast. The homozygotes had low baseline blood glucose values, but a similar decrease in response to fasting as in wild-type mice, resulting in hypoglycemia in the majority. Despite the already depleted glycogen and increased triacylglycerol content in the mutant livers, the mice responded to fasting by further depletion and increase, respectively. Increased plasma free fatty  (FAs) upon fasting suggested normal capacity for mobilization of lipids from white adipose tissue into circulation. Strikingly, however, serum glycerol concentration was not increased concomitantly with free FAs, suggesting its rapid uptake into the liver and utilization for fuel or gluconeogenesis in the mutants. The mutant hepatocyte mitochondria were capable of responding to fasting by appropriate morphological changes, as analyzed by electron microscopy, and by increasing respiration. Mutants showed increased hepatic gene expression of major metabolic controllers typically associated with fasting response (Ppargc1a, Fgf21, Cd36) already in the fed state, suggesting a chronic starvation-like metabolic condition. Despite this, the mutant mice responded largely normally to fasting by increasing hepatic respiration and switching to FA utilization, indicating that the mechanisms driving these adaptations are not compromised by the CIII dysfunction. SUMMARY STATEMENT: Bcs1l mutant mice with severe CIII deficiency, energy deprivation and post-weaning lipolysis respond to fasting similarly to wild-type mice, suggesting largely normal systemic  mobilization and utilization mechanisms.Copyright © 2019.

Bile  (BA)  plays an important role in removing excess cholesterol from the body. However, studies on the effects of LF on BA  are limited and inconsistent.Male C57BL/6J mice aged 6-8 weeks were fed with a normal diet (control group), high-/high-cholesterol diet containing cholate (HFCCD group), or HFCCD and 1.0% LF in drinking water (LF group) for 8 weeks. Serum and hepatic  profiles, and glucose tolerance were measured. Fecal BA composition was determined through ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. The gene expression of BA synthase in the liver and farnesoid X receptor (FXR)-mediated BA negative feedback regulation pathway in the liver and ileum were analyzed via RNA analysis.HFCCD resulted in abnormal cholesterol levels in the serum and liver. LF intervention significantly increased the serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level by 24.9% and decreased the hepatic total cholesterol content by 26%. LF treatment significantly increased the BA content per gram by 109.8%, the total amount of BA excretion by 153.5% and conjugated BAs by 87.6% in the feces. Furthermore, LF upregulated the expression of the hepatic sterol 12α-hydroxylase (CYP8B1) gene, which expresses important enzymes in the classical pathway of BA synthesis, and the bile -CoA amino  N-acetyltransferase (BAAT) gene, which is responsible for the formation of conjugated BAs. The FXR-mediated pathways in the enterohepatic axis, including FXR, fibroblast growth factor 15, and fibroblast growth factor receptor 4, were inhibited by LF.LF ameliorated hepatic cholesterol deposition in mice fed with a high- and high cholesterol diet containing cholate. LF elevated the conjugated BA level, inhibited the ileum FXR and FXR-mediated enterohepatic axis, and increased BA synthesis and excretion.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31650134>Regulation effects of rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis Linn.) on hepatic  in OA induced NAFLD rats.</a></h1><p>Rosmarinus officinalis Linn. is a kind of medicinal and edible homologous plant, which is popular in the Mediterranean region with a significant effect on mind tranquilization, anti-oxidation, and metabolic improvement. However, the hypolipidemic effects and mechanism of rosemary ethanol extract (RO) and their metabolites are less known. In this study, the hypolipidemic effects of RO and its active compounds were clarified. The results showed that RO, rosmarinic  (RA) and carnosic  (CA) significantly reduced the contents of liver triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), free fatty  (FFA) and improved cell hypertrophy, vacuolation, and cell necrosis in the liver of orotic  induced non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) model rats. The mechanism and related pathways of RO and its main metabolites against  disorder were related to the up-regulation of the phosphorylation of adenosine 5'-monophosphate(AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and the inhibition of the sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c) cracking into the nucleus, following the down-regulation of fatty  synthesis. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that RA and CA are active substances of RO, and provides scientific evidence to support functional food product development for improving NAFLD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666479>Diosgenin Supplementation Prevents  Accumulation and Induces Skeletal Muscle-Fiber Hypertrophy in Rats.</a></h1><p>Diosgenin (Dio) is a steroid sapogenin found in plants such as Dioscorea species, and is recognized as a phytochemical against various disorders as well as a natural precursor of steroidal drugs. The present study used rats fed high-cholesterol (Chol) diets supplemented with or without 0.5% Dio for 6 wk to investigate the effects of dietary Dio on . Dio supplementation significantly increased serum high-density lipoprotein Chol concentrations and fecal Chol content, and significantly decreased fecal bile  content compared rats fed a high-Chol diet alone, showing that dietary Dio may facilitate excretion of Chol rather than bile . A reduction in the liver triglyceride content and intra-abdominal visceral  was observed in Dio-supplemented rats. Interestingly, dietary Dio also significantly increased the skeletal muscle-fiber diameter and area in the thigh muscles of the rats. Mouse myoblast-derived C2C12 cells were used to examine whether Dio directly affected skeletal muscle. Dio promoted fusion of myoblasts into multinucleated cells or myotubes. Furthermore, in myotube C2C12 cells, protein levels of phosphorylated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) increased with Dio treatment in a dose-dependent manner. These results indicate that Dio may not only induce myoblast fusion and enhance skeletal muscle as an energy expenditure organ, but may also activate the catabolic pathway via AMPK in skeletal muscle cells. Thus, these effects of Dio on skeletal muscles may contribute to inhibition of visceral  accumulation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31607681>Mice lacking DGKε show increased beige adipogenesis in visceral white adipose tissue after long-term high  diet in a COX-2- dependent manner.</a></h1><p>Adipose tissue is a central site for energy storage in the form of triglyceride (TG). Under excess energy conditions, TG is synthesized by acylation of diacylglycerol (DG), whereas TG is broken down into DG and free fatty , which provide energy for mitochondrial  oxidation when needed. In this regard, DG is not merely an intermediate metabolite for TG ; it also serves as a signaling molecule. DG kinase (DGK) phosphorylates DG to produce phosphatidic  (PA). Consequently, DGK plays a pivotal role in the control of  and signal transduction pathway. Recently, a report has described that DGKε-knockout (KO) mice show expansion of epididymal white adipose tissue (WAT) together with the impairment of glucose clearance after short-term (40 days) high  diet (HFD) feeding, an early presymptomatic phase of obesity in wild-type animals. Nevertheless, no report describes an investigation of their phenotype under long-term HFD feeding conditions. Remarkably, results obtained during long-term HFD feeding show that WAT mass is decreased significantly and that the blood glucose profile in response to glucose challenge is improved in DGKε-KO mice compared with wild-type, which contrast sharply against the phenotype shown for short-term HFD feeding. Morphological examination reveals that cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression and clusters of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1)-positive multilocular brown-like ("beige") adipocyte are induced in DGKε-deficient WAT after long-term HFD feeding, suggesting that beige adipocytes facilitate energy expenditure during prolonged HFD feeding. Administration of celecoxib, a selective inhibitor of COX-2, abolishes the appearance of UCP1-positive beige adipocytes in DGKε-KO mice. These findings suggest that DGKε deficiency promotes visceral WAT remodeling in a COX-2-dependent manner under long-term HFD feeding conditions.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Using a model of prenatal maternal 70% food restriction diet (FR30) in rat, we previously showed that maternal undernutrition predisposes offspring to altered  in adipose tissue, especially under high- (HF) diet. Here, using microarray-based expression profiling combined with metabolic, endocrine, biochemical, histological and lipidomic approaches, we assessed whether FR30 procedure sensitizes adult male offspring to impaired  in the liver. No obvious differences were noted in the concentrations of triglycerides, cholesterol and bile  in the liver of 4-month-old FR30 rats whatever the post-weaning diet used. However, several clues suggest that offspring's  and steatosis are modified by maternal undernutrition. First,  composition was changed (i.e., higher total saturated fatty  and lower elaidic ) in the liver whereas larger triglyceride droplets were observed in hepatocytes of undernourished rats. Second, FR30 offspring exhibited - impact on hepatic gene expression and  pathways under chow diet. Although the transcriptome profile was globally modified by maternal undernutrition, cholesterol and bile  biosynthesis pathways appear as key targets indicating that FR30 animals were predisposed to impaired hepatic cholesterol . Third, FR30 procedure markedly modifies hepatic gene transcription profiles in undernourished offspring in response to post-weaning HF. Overall, FR30 offspring may exhibit impaired metabolic flexibility which does not enable them to properly cope with post-weaning nutritional challenges influencing the development of non-alcoholic fatty liver (NAFL).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31620014>Cold Induced Depot-Specific Browning in Ferret Aortic Perivascular Adipose Tissue.</a></h1><p>Brown adipose tissue is responsible for facultative thermogenesis to produce heat and increase energy expenditure in response to proper stimuli, e.g., cold. Acquisition of brown-like features (browning) in perivascular white adipose tissue (PVAT) may protect against obesity/cardiovascular disease. Most browning studies are performed in rodents, but translation to humans would benefit from a closer animal model. Therefore, we studied the browning response of ferret thoracic aortic PVAT (tPVAT) to cold. We performed global transcriptome analysis of tPVAT of 3-month-old ferrets acclimatized 1 week to 22 or 4°C, and compared the results with those of inguinal subcutaneous adipose tissue. Immunohistochemistry was used to visualize browning. Transcriptome data revealed a stronger cold exposure response of tPVAT, including increased expression of key brown/brite markers, compared to subcutaneous . This translated into a clear white-to-brown remodeling of tPVAT, with the appearance of multilocular highly UCP1-stained adipocytes. The pathway most affected by cold exposure in tPVAT was immune response, characterized by down-regulation of immune-related genes, with cardio protective implications. On the other hand, subcutaneous  responded to cold by increasing energy  based on increased expression of fatty  oxidation and tricarboxylic  cycle genes, concordant with lower inguinal adipose tissue weight in cold-exposed animals. Thus, ferret tPVAT responds to cold acclimation with a strong induction of browning and immunosuppression compared to subcutaneous . Our results present ferrets as an accessible translational animal model displaying functional responses relevant for obesity and cardiovascular disease prevention.Copyright © 2019 Reynés, van Schothorst, Keijer, Ceresi, Oliver and Palou.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31612075>Cholesterol Prevents Hypoxia-Induced Hypoglycemia by Regulation of a Metabolic Ketogenic Shift.</a></h1><p>Blood cholesterol levels have been connected to high-altitude adaptation. In the present study, we treated mice with high-cholesterol diets following exposure to acute hypoxic stress and evaluated the effects of the diets on whole-body, liver glucose, and liver . For rapid cholesterol liver uptake, 6-week-old male C57BL/J6 mice were fed with high-cholesterol/cholic  (CH) diet for 6 weeks and then were exposed to gradual oxygen level reduction for 1 h and hypoxia at 7% oxygen for additional 1 hour using a hypoxic chamber. Animals were than sacrificed, and metabolic markers were evaluated. Hypoxic treatment had a strong hypoglycemic effect that was completely blunted by CH treatment. Decreases in gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis as well as an increase in ketone body formation were observed. Such changes indicate a metabolic shift from glucose to  utilization due to activation of the inducible nitric oxide synthase/AMPK axis in the CH-treated animals. Increased ketogenesis was also observed in vitro in hepatocytes after cholesterol treatment. In conclusion, our results show for the first time that cholesterol contributes to metabolic shift and adaptation to hypoxia in vivo and in vitro through induction of HIF-1 and iNOS expression.Copyright © 2019 Naama Miron and Oren Tirosh.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31623069>Using Transcriptome Analysis to Screen for Key Genes and Pathways Related to Cytoplasmic Male Sterility in Cotton ( L.).</a></h1><p>Cotton ( L.) is one of the most important cash crops worldwide. Cytoplasmic male sterility (CMS) is an excellent breeding system for exploitation of heterosis, which has great potential to increase crop yields. To understand the molecular mechanism of CMS in cotton, we compared transcriptome, cytomorphological, physiological and bioinformatics data between the CMS line C2P5A and its maintainer line C2P5B. By using high-throughput sequencing technology, 178,166 transcripts were assembled and 2013 differentially expression genes (DEGs) were identified at three different stages of C2P5A anther development. In this study, we identified DEGs associated with reactive oxygen species (ROS), peroxisomes, aldehyde dehydrogenases (ALDH), cytochrome oxidase subunit VI, and cytochrome P450, and DEGs associated with tapetum development, Jojoba acyl-CoA reductase-related male sterility protein, basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) and MYB transcription factors. The abnormal expression of one of these genes may be responsible for the CMS C2P5A line. In gene ontology (GO) annotation and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment, DEGs were mainly related to carbohydrate , amino  , transport and catabolism, and signal transduction. Carbohydrate  provides energy for anther development, starch and sucrose , fatty  biosynthesis and  and ascorbate and aldarate . These results showed that numerous genes and multiple complex metabolic pathways regulate cotton anther development. Weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) indicated that three modules, 'turquoise,' 'blue,' and 'green,' were specific for the CMS C2P5A line. The 'turquoise' and 'blue' modules were mainly related to carbohydrate , amino  , energy , peroxisomes, pyruvate  as well as fatty  degradation. The 'green' module was mainly related to energy , carbon , translation, and . RNA-sequencing and WGCNA polymerization modules were screened for key genes and pathways related to CMS in cotton. This study presents a new perspective for further research into the metabolic pathways of pollen abortion in the CMS C2P5A line and also provides a theoretical basis for its breeding and production.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670380>Metabolomics study of fasudil on cisplatin-induced kidney injury.</a></h1><p>Fasudil is a derivative of 5-isoquinoline sulfonamide, which is a Rho kinase inhibitor, a wide range of pharmacological effects. Fasudil has been shown to attenuate kidney injury caused by certain substances. In the present study, metabolomic analysis of mouse kidney tissues ultra-performance liquid chromatography/quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry was used to determine the metabolomic changes in cisplatin-induced kidney injury and the fasudil-induced attenuation of cisplatin-induced kidney injury. Metabolomic profiling of kidney tissues revealed significant differences in metabolites between the control group and the cisplatin group and between the cisplatin group and the fasudil-intervention group. With metabolomic approach, 68 endogenous differential metabolites were found, and multivariate statistical analysis, accurate molecular weights, isotope tracers, mass-spectrometry secondary-fragment information, and standard-reference comparisons were used to identify these substances. Based on these differential metabolites, a metabolic-pathway network was constructed and revealed that fasudil primarily attenuated cisplatin-induced renal injury by modulating  and amino- . These results further demonstrate that kidney injury can be induced by cisplatin and, moreover, suggest that fasudil can be used to reduce kidney injury at early stages in patients treated with cisplatin.Copyright 2019 The Author(s).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31671667>Methods and Guidelines for Measurement of Glucagon in Plasma.</a></h1><p>Glucagon circulates in concentrations in the low picomolar range, which is demanding regarding the sensitivity of the methods for quantification applied. In addition, the differential and tissue specific proteolytic processing of the glucagon precursor and the presence in of several glucagon-like sequences, not only in the precursor of glucagon, but also in a number of other peptides of the glucagon-secretin family of peptides, put special demands on the specificity of the assays. Finally, experience has shown that unspecific interference of plasma components has presented additional problems. All of these problems have resulted in a lot of diverging results concerning measured and reported glucagon responses in both humans and experimental animals that have and still are causing considerable debate and controversy. There is very solid evidence that glucagon is an important hormone in human and mammalian , but its precise physiological role in glucose and  and in metabolic disease has been difficult to establish, not least because of these difficulties. It was our purpose with this review to discuss the methods of glucagon quantification and discuss pitfalls and sources of error. We also reviewed some of the dogmas regarding glucagon secretion in the light of the methodological difficulties.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31587363>Lysosomal  lipase does not have a propeptide and should not be considered being a proprotein.</a></h1><p>Lysosomal  lipase (LAL) plays an important role in  by performing hydrolysis of triglycerides and cholesteryl esters in the lysosome. Based upon characteristics of LAL purified from human liver, it has been proposed that LAL is a proprotein with a 55 residue propeptide that may be essential for proper folding, intracellular transport, or enzymatic function. However, the biological significance of such a propeptide has not been fully elucidated. In this study, we have performed a series of studies in cultured HepG2 and HeLa cells to determine the role of the putative propeptide. However, by Western blot analysis and subcellular fractionation, we have not been able to identify a cleaved LAL lacking the N-terminal 55 residues. Moreover, mutating residues surrounding the putative cleavage site at Lys ↓ in order to disrupt a proteinase recognition sequence, did not affect LAL activity. Furthermore, forcing cleavage at Lys ↓ by introducing the optimal furin cleavage site RRRR↓EL between residues 76 and 77, did not affect LAL activity. These data, in addition to bioinformatics analyses, indicate that LAL is not a proprotein. Thus, it is possible that the previously reported cleavage at Lys ↓ could have resulted from exposure to proteolytic enzymes during the multistep purification procedure.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31604978>Plasmodium Infection Induces Dyslipidemia and a Hepatic Lipogenic State in the Host through the Inhibition of the AMPK-ACC Pathway.</a></h1><p>Malaria is a major parasitic disease of humans and is a health public problem that affects more than 100 countries. In 2017, it caused nearly half a million deaths out of 219 million infections. Malaria is caused by the protozoan parasites of the genus Plasmodium and is transmitted by female mosquitoes of the genus Anopheles. Once in the bloodstream, Plasmodium merozoites invade erythrocytes and proliferate until the cells lyses and release new parasites that invade other erythrocytes. Remarkably, they can manipulate the vertebrate host's  pathways, since they cannot synthesize  classes that are essential for their development and replication. In this study, we show that mice infected with Plasmodium chabaudi present a completely different plasma profile from control mice, with marked hyperproteinemia, hypertriglyceridemia, hypoglycemia, and hypocholesterolemia. In addition, white adipose and hepatic tissue and analyses from infected animals revealed the accumulation of triacylglycerol in both tissues and free fatty  and free cholesterol in the liver. Hepatic mRNA and protein expression of key enzymes and transcription factors involved in  were also altered by P. chabaudi infection, leading to a lipogenic state. The enzyme 5' AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a master regulator of cell energetic , was also modulated by the parasite, which reduced AMPK phosphorylation levels upon infection. Pretreatment with metformin for 21 days followed by infection with P. chabaudi was effective in preventing infection of mice and also lowered the hepatic accumulation of lipids while activating AMPK. Together, these results provide new and important information on the specific molecular mechanisms induced by the malaria parasite to regulate hepatic  in order to facilitate its development, proliferation, and lifespan in its vertebrate host.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31586915> disorders contribute to hepatotoxicity of triclosan in mice.</a></h1><p>Previous in vivo exposure studies focused mainly on nuclear receptors involved in hepatotoxicity of triclosan (TCS). As liver plays a vital role in metabolic processes, dysregulations in  have been identified as potential drivers of pathogenesis. Investigation of changes in  might widen our understanding of toxicological effects as well as the underlying mechanism occurring in the liver. In this study, we comprehensively assessed the effect of TCS exposure on hepatic  in mice. Our results showed that TCS induced significant changes in hepatic free fatty  pool by upregulation of fatty  uptake and de novo fatty  synthesis. Besides, hepatic levels of lipids, including acyl carnitine (AcCa), ceramide (Cer), triacylglycerols (TG), phosphatidylcholine (PC), lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) were also increased, together with upreguation of genes associated to TG synthesis, fatty  oxidation and inflammation in TCS exposure group. These changes in  homeostasis could contribute to membrane instability,  accumulation, oxidative stress and inflammation. Our results suggested that TCS exposure could induce hepatic  disorders in mice, which would further contribute to the liver damage effects of TCS.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

To identify new genes involved in central liver functions, we examined liver RNA-sequence data from 259 patients who underwent morbidly obese bariatric surgery. Of these patients, 84 had normal liver histology, 40 simple steatosis, 43 nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, and the remaining 92 patients had varying degrees of NAFLD based on liver histology.

And five C57 BL/6 mice with the same genetic background were used as control group. After 18 weeks feeding, HE staining were performed for atherosclerotic lesions from transverse section of the aorta and hepatic histological examination.

Mammals have three GGAs (GGA1-3) that work not only at the trans-Golgi network, but also in endosomes to sort transmembrane cargo proteins such as mannose 6-phosphate receptors, sortilin, β-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1, and epidermal growth factor receptor. The cytoplasmic regions of these cargoes possess motifs of acidic amino  cluster-dileucine and/or ubiquitination sites, which can be recognized by GGAs. Despite seminal investigations of the three molecules, their in vivo roles and functional redundancies, as well as relationships with a heterotetrameric adaptor protein, AP-1, which is functionally similar to GGAs were still poorly understood. Studies over the past two decades, however, discovered several new GGA cargoes, their interaction modes, and accessory proteins. These findings collectively suggest distinct and more fundamental roles of each GGA in regulating neuronal survival, , and cell proliferation. This review aims to provide an update to the GGA research focusing on how GGAs became considered not only as players in the context of the TGN-endosome transport, but also as key regulators for physiologically and pathologically important phenomena.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652726>Transcriptomic Revelation of Phenolic Compounds Involved in Aluminum Toxicity Responses in Roots of Cunninghamia lanceolata (Lamb.) Hook.</a></h1><p> Chinese fir (Cunninghamia lanceolata (Lamb.) Hook.) is one of the most important coniferous evergreen tree species in South China due to its desirable attributes of fast growth and production of strong and hardy wood. However, the yield of Chinese fir is often inhibited by aluminum (Al) toxicity in acidic soils of South China. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of Chinese fir root responses to Al toxicity might help to further increase its productivity. Here we used the Illumina Hiseq4000 platform to carry out transcriptome analysis of Chinese fir roots subjected to Al toxicity conditions. A total of 88.88 Gb of clean data was generated from 12 samples and assembled into 105,732 distinct unigenes. The average length and N50 length of these unigenes were 839 bp and 1411 bp, respectively. Among them, 58362 unigenes were annotated through searches of five public databases (Nr: NCBI non-redundant protein sequences, Swiss-Prot: A manually annotated and reviewed protein sequence database, GO: Gene Ontology, KOG/COG: Clusters of Orthologous Groups of proteins, and KEGG: the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes database), which led to association of unigenes with 44 GO terms. Plus, 1615 transcription factors (TFs) were functionally classified. Then, differentially expressed genes (DEGs, |log(fold change)| ≥ 1 and FDR ≤ 0.05) were identified in comparisons labelled TC1 (CK-72 h/CK-1 h) and TC2 (Al-72 h/Al-1 h). A large number of TC2 DEGs group were identified, with most being down-regulated under Al stress, while TC1 DEGs were primarily up-regulated. Combining GO, KEGG, and MapMan pathway analysis indicated that many DEGs are involved in primary , including cell wall  and , while other DEGs are associated with signaling pathways and secondary , including flavonoids and phenylpropanoids . Furthermore, TFs identified in TC1 and TC2 DEGs represented 21 and 40 transcription factor families, respectively. Among them, expression of bHLH, C2H2, ERF, bZIP, GRAS, and MYB TFs changed considerably under Al stress, which suggests that these TFs might play crucial roles in Chinese fir root responses to Al toxicity. These differentially expressed TFs might act in concert with flavonoid and phenylpropanoid pathway genes in fulfilling of key roles in Chinese fir roots responding to Al toxicity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31673703>Glucagon-Receptor Signaling Reverses Hepatic Steatosis Independent of Leptin Receptor Expression.</a></h1><p>Glucagon (GCG) is an essential regulator of glucose and  that also promotes weight loss. We have shown that glucagon-receptor (GCGR) signaling increases fatty  oxidation (FAOx) in primary hepatocytes and reduces liver triglycerides in diet-induced obese (DIO) mice; however, the mechanisms underlying this aspect of GCG biology remains unclear. Investigation of hepatic GCGR targets elucidated a potent and previously unknown induction of leptin receptor (Lepr) expression. Liver leptin signaling is known to increase FAOx and decrease liver triglycerides, similar to glucagon action. Therefore, we hypothesized that glucagon increases hepatic LEPR, which is necessary for glucagon-mediated reversal of hepatic steatosis. Eight week-old control and liver-specific, LEPR-deficient mice (LeprΔliver) were placed on a high  diet (HFD) for 12 weeks and then treated with a selective GCGR agonist (IUB288) for 14 days. Liver triglycerides and gene expression were assessed in liver tissue homogenates. Administration of IUB288 in both lean and DIO mice increased hepatic Lepr isoforms a-e in acute (4h) and chronic (72h,16d) (p<0.05) settings. LeprΔliver mice displayed increased hepatic triglycerides on a chow diet alone (p<0.05), which persisted in a DIO state (p<0.001), with no differences in body weight or composition. Surprisingly, chronic administration of IUB288 in DIO control and LeprΔliver mice reduced liver triglycerides regardless of genotype (p<0.05). Together these data suggest that GCGR activation induces hepatic Lepr expression and although hepatic glucagon and leptin signaling have similar liver  targets, these appear to be two distinct pathways.© Endocrine Society 2019.

These molecules are used as alternative fuel for energy production in target tissues. The synthesis and utilization of KB are tightly regulated both at transcriptional and hormonal levels. The nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator activated receptor α (PPARα), currently recognized as one of the master regulators of ketogenesis, integrates nutritional signals to the activation of transcriptional networks regulating fatty  β-oxidation and ketogenesis. New factors, such as circadian rhythms and paracrine signals, are emerging as important aspects of this metabolic regulation. However, KB are currently considered not only as energy substrates but also as signaling molecules. β-hydroxybutyrate has been identified as class I histone deacetylase inhibitor, thus establishing a connection between products of hepatic  and epigenetics. Ketogenic diets (KD) are currently used to treat different forms of infantile epilepsy, also caused by genetic defects such as Glut1 and Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Deficiency Syndromes. However, several researchers are now focusing on the possibility to use KD in other diseases, such as cancer, neurological and metabolic disorders.

We aimed to investigate the independent contribution of visceral adipose measured by visceral adiposity index and  accumulation product and liver  assessed by fatty liver index to the risk of hyperuricemia.We conducted a cross-sectional study involving 1284 participants aged ≥ 40 years old recruited from communities in Zhonglou district, Changzhou. Each participant completed a standard questionnaire, and provided blood samples for biochemical measurements. Visceral adiposity index, fatty liver index and  accumulation product were calculated by simple anthropometric and functional parameters. Hyperuricemia was defined as serum uric  ≥ 420 μmol/l for males and ≥ 360 μmol/l for females.The prevalence of hyperuricemia was 15.9% and gradually increased across tertiles of adiposity-based indices. The visceral adipose-based measurements (visceral adiposity index, fatty liver index,  accumulation product) had better power to discriminate hyperuricemia than body mass index (BMI), waist circumference and neck circumference, and visceral adiposity index exhibited the highest power, with the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUROC) of 0.662 (0.636-0.688). Multivariate logistic regression found 1.49-fold, 2.21-fold and 2.12-fold increased risk of hyperuricemia with 1-unit increment of visceral adiposity index, fatty liver index, and  accumulation product, respectively. Compared to tertile 1, the odds ratios of hyperuricemia for the second tertile and the third tertile of visceral adiposity index were 1.57 (1.00-2.50) and 3.11 (1.96-4.94), those of fatty liver index were 1.64 (1.05-2.68) and 3.58 (1.94-6.01), and those of  accumulation product were 1.93 (1.19-3.15) and 3.53 (2.05-6.09), respectively.

In this study, we further investigated the effects of TLR4 on islet function and pancreatic proteomics in obese rats by high- diet.PA-induced lipotoxicity β-cells, SD and TLR4 rats were used in this study. iTRAQ was used to screen out meaningful differential proteins.The protein expression level was evaluated by Western blotting; the cell apoptosis was detected by TUNEL assay.TLR4 could reduce inflammatory and regulate body composition in obese rats, and improve β-cells function. The quantitative analysis of protein revealed that TLR4 rebalanced proteomics disorders in pancreas of obese rats. In addition, the pathways involved in differential proteins were mainly metabolic pathways, arachidonic  , ECM-receptor interaction, pancreatic secretion, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, and FoxO signaling pathway. Further analysis of protein-protein interaction (PPI) revealed that Stk39 and Ass1 interacting through Mapk14-Ywhae were node proteins and participated in inflammatory response, carboxylic  metabolic process, and small molecule metabolic process. In vitro experiments we confirmed that silencing TLR4 can inhibit PA-induced β-cell apoptosis, insulin secretion disorders, and increase Ass1 expression.

Theabrownin is one of the most active and abundant pigments in Pu-erh tea. Here, we show that theabrownin alters the gut microbiota in mice and humans, predominantly suppressing microbes associated with bile-salt hydrolase (BSH) activity. Theabrownin increases the levels of ileal conjugated bile  (BAs) which, in turn, inhibit the intestinal FXR-FGF15 signaling pathway, resulting in increased hepatic production and fecal excretion of BAs, reduced hepatic cholesterol, and decreased lipogenesis. The inhibition of intestinal FXR-FGF15 signaling is accompanied by increased gene expression of enzymes in the alternative BA synthetic pathway, production of hepatic chenodeoxycholic , activation of hepatic FXR, and hepatic lipolysis. Our results shed light into the mechanisms behind the cholesterol- and -lowering effects of Pu-erh tea, and suggest that decreased intestinal BSH microbes and/or decreased FXR-FGF15 signaling may be potential anti-hypercholesterolemia and anti-hyperlipidemia therapies.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31607479>Effects of maternal dietary supplementation of phytosterol esters during gestation on muscle development of offspring in mice.</a></h1><p>The development of muscle in the embryo, which is crucial for postnatal skeletal muscle growth, has been investigated widely. Much has been learned during the past several decades about the role of maternal nutrition in the outcome of pregnancy. Protein and carbohydrate levels during pregnancy have been shown to be important in the development of offspring, especially muscle development. However, the maternal effects of steroids were still not clear. Phytosterol esters (PEs) are produced by the esterification of phytosterols and fatty  and have many beneficial functions, such as anti-inflammation and hypolipemic functions. Through the effect of regulation on , can pregnant mice fed with PEs show any programming effect on the muscle development of offspring? In our study, PEs were supplied to the maternal diet, and changes in maternal  and the development of offspring skeletal muscle were detected. As a result, the amniotic fluid total bile  (TBA) and total cholesterol (TC) levels were decreased; the growth of offspring was significantly faster than that of the control group until 6 weeks of age. Adult offspring had a higher lean mass index and grip strength. In skeletal muscle, the proportion of myosin heavy chain (MHC) 1 was significantly decreased, while the proportion of MHC 2 b was increased. In conclusion, maternal PEs significantly reduced sterols in the amniotic fluid, while skeletal muscle development was promoted in the offspring.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

We examined the effects of acute or chronic intraperitoneal treatment with PEA (20 μg·g body weight) on parameters related to food intake and its regulatory mechanisms, locomotor activity, glucose and , and the possible involvement of transcription factors and clock genes on metabolic changes in the liver. Acute PEA treatment induced a decrease in food intake at 6 and 8 h post-injection, comparable to that observed in mammals. This PEA anorectic effect in goldfish could be mediated through interactions with leptin and NPY, as PEA increased hepatic expression of leptin aI and reduced hypothalamic expression of npy. The PEA chronic treatment reduced weight gain, growth rate, and locomotor activity. The rise in glycolytic potential together with the increased potential of glucose to be transported into liver suggests an enhanced use of glucose in the liver after PEA treatment. In addition, part of glucose may be exported to be used in other tissues. The activity of fatty  synthase (FAS) increased after chronic PEA treatment, suggesting an increase in the hepatic lipogenic capacity, in contrast with the mammalian model. Such lipogenic increment could be linked with the PEA-induction of REV-ERBα and BMAL1 found after the chronic treatment. As a whole, the present study shows the actions of PEA in several compartments related to energy homeostasis and feeding behavior, supporting a regulatory role for this N-acylethanolamine in fish.Copyright © 2019.

Hence, including rice with RS level at ≥ 1.07% may attenuate risks associated with consumption of a moderately high- diet.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672146>Short-term treatment with high dose liraglutide improves  and lipoprotein profile and changes hormonal mediators of  in obese patients with no overt type 2 diabetes mellitus: a randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over, double-blind clinical trial.</a></h1><p>Long-term treatment with up to 1.8 mg liraglutide improves cardiovascular and all-cause mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes at high risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and is currently under investigation in subjects without diabetes. Aim of our study was to investigate whether high dose (3 mg) short-term (5 weeks) treatment with liraglutide in obese patients with no overt type 2 diabetes affects metabolites,  and lipoprotein profile and components of activin-follistatin axis in cardiovascular beneficial or detrimental way.Twenty obese patients participated in a randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over, double-blind study and were administrated liraglutide 3 mg or placebo for 5 weeks. Metabolites, fatty , -lipoprotein profile and concentrations of activins and follistatins (250 parameters) were assessed in serum at start and completion of each treatment.Concentrations of important cardiovascular markers such as total, free and remnant cholesterol were reduced with liraglutide before and after adjusting for weight loss. Similarly, reductions in number of small and medium size LDL particles and in their total  concentration were observed with liraglutide and partially weight-loss related. Tyrosine levels were reduced and behenic  levels were increased whereas only minor changes were observed in HDL, VLDL and IDL. Concentrations of activin AB and follistatin were significantly reduced in liraglutide-treated group.Treatment of obese patients without overt type 2 diabetes with high dose of liraglutide for a short period of time induces changes in -lipoprotein and hormonal profile that are suggestive of lower risk of atherosclerosis and CVD.

It is the only Prdx acting on phospholipid hydroperoxides possessing two additional sites with phospholipase A2 (PLA2) and lysophosphatidylcholine-acyl transferase (LPCAT) activities. There are contrasting reports on the roles and mechanisms of multifunctional Prdx6 in several pathologies and on its sensitivity to, and influence on, the redox environment. We have down-regulated Prdx6 with specific siRNA in hepatoblastoma HepG2 cells to study its role in cell proliferation, redox homeostasis, and metabolic programming. Cell proliferation and cell number decreased while cell volume increased; import of glucose and nucleotide biosynthesis also diminished while polyamines, phospholipids, and most glycolipids increased. A proteomic quantitative analysis suggested changes in membrane arrangement and vesicle trafficking as well as redox changes in enzymes of carbon and glutathione , pentose-phosphate pathway, citrate cycle, fatty  , biosynthesis of aminoacids, and Glycolysis/Gluconeogenesis. Specific redox changes in Hexokinase-2 (HK2), Prdx6, intracellular chloride ion channel-1 (CLIC1), PEP-carboxykinase-2 (PCK2), and 3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH) are compatible with the metabolic remodeling toward a predominant gluconeogenic flow from aminoacids with diversion at 3-phospohglycerate toward serine and other biosynthetic pathways thereon and with cell cycle arrest at G1/S transition.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31611740> fatty  as preventive and therapeutic agents in attenuating PCOS complications.</a></h1><p>To our knowledge, in spite of several trials exploring the beneficial effect of -3 polyunsaturated fatty  (PUFA) on polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), no comprehensive evidence has investigated the effects of -3 PUFA consumption on PCOS complications. Therefore, our aim was to conduct a review to investigate the possible effect and related mechanisms. A comprehensive systematic search was conducted in Embase, MEDLINE/PubMed, Google Scholar, and SCOPUS, to identify studies investigating -3 fatty  as a preventative or therapeutic agent for the attenuation of PCOS complications. Subsequently, the impact of omega-3 on PCOS, omega-3 and inflammation, omega-3 and insulin resistance, omega-3 and adipokines, omega-3 and , omega-3 and endothelial function and omega-3 and hormonal factors were discussed. There are multiple mechanisms by which -3 PUFAs may exert their beneficial effects on PCOS, including anti-obesity, glycemic and hormonal hemostasis, anti-inflammatory, regulation of adipokine production and enhancement of endothelial function -3 PUFAs are a promising agent in relieving complications associated with PCOS. Although most of the studies in patients with PCOS reported an improvement in most complications after administration of omega-3 supplements, there is a distinct dearth of studies investigating the dietary intake of these types of fatty . Moreover, favorable effects regarding the improvement of dyslipidemia, regulation of adipokines, regulation of hormonal factors and enhancement of endothelial function are limited. Therefore, more trials are warranted to investigate palatable mechanisms for clarifying the metabolic and hormonal effects of these agents in PCOS.Copyright © 2019 Salek et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657926>Digestion, absorption and  characteristics of EPA-enriched phosphoethanolamine plasmalogens based on gastrointestinal functions in healthy mice.</a></h1><p>EPA-enriched phosphoethanolamine plasmalogens (EPA-pPE), widely present in marine creatures, is a unique glycerophospholipid with EPA at the sn-2 position of glycerol backbone. EPA-pPE has been reported to exhibit numerous distinctive bioactivities. However, the digestion, absorption and  characteristics of EPA-pPE in vivo are not clear, which restrict the molecular mechanism analysis related to its distinctive activities. The aim of the present study was to illustrate the digestion, absorption and  characteristics of EPA-pPE by  analysis in serum, intestinal wall and content after oral administration of EPA-pPE emulsion. Results showed the EPA percentage of total fatty  in serum was increasing over time, with two peaks at 5 and 10 h by 1.89±0.2 and 2.58±0.27, respectively, then fell from 1.89±0.17 at 10h to 1.35±0.16 at16h. In small intestinal content, EPA-pPE was hydrolyzed to lyso-phospholipids and EPA by phospholipases A2, the vinyl ether bond was retained at the sn-1 position. The released EPA could be quickly taken up into the enterocytes and enter circulation. The comparison of simulated digestion in vitro showed that the distinct digestion and absorption process of EPA-pPE was a unique phenomenon. EPA could be retained in serum at high level for a substantial period of time, which suggested us that EPA-pPE was not just a short-lived circulating molecular.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661927>A Shifty Target: Tumor-Initiating Cells and Their .</a></h1><p>Tumor-initiating cells (TICs), or cancer stem cells, constitute highly chemoresistant, asymmetrically dividing, and tumor-initiating populations in cancer and are thought to play a key role in metastatic and chemoresistant disease. Tumor-initiating cells are isolated from cell lines and clinical samples based on features such as sphere formation in stem cell medium and expression of TIC markers, typically a set of outer membrane proteins and certain transcription factors. Although both bulk tumor cells and TICs show an adaptive metabolic plasticity, TIC  is thought to differ and likely in a tumor-specific and growth condition-dependent pattern. In the context of some common solid tumor diseases, we here review reports on how TIC isolation methods and markers associate with metabolic features, with some focus on oxidative , including fatty  and . These have emerged as significant factors in TIC phenotypes, and in tumor biology as a whole. Other sections address mitochondrial biogenesis and dynamics in TICs, and the influence of the tumor microenvironment. Further elucidation of the complex biology of TICs and their  will require advanced methodologies.</p></html>
