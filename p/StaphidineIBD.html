Recent data also demonstrate efficacy in Crohn's disease (CD); however, little is known about target drug levels to achieve endoscopic remission.We performed a retrospective analysis of  patients on maintenance golimumab. Median trough levels were compared using Kruskal-Wallis test, and logistic regression was used to construct a probabilistic model to determine sensitivity and specificity of levels predicting mucosal healing.Fifty-eight patients on maintenance golimumab were included (n = 39 CD, n = 19 UC/-unclassified [IBDU]). Forty percent (n = 23) were cotreated with an immunomodulator, 95% (n = 55) of patients were anti-TNF experienced, and 15.5% (n = 9) had 3 or more prior biologic therapies. Forty-four percent of patients achieved mucosal healing with endoscopic response in a further 26% of patients. Clinical remission was recorded in 41% of patients, and 82% had clinical response. Patients were treated with doses generally higher than the approved maintenance dose. In CD patients, median golimumab trough levels were higher in patients with mucosal healing (8.8 μg/mL vs 5.08 μg/mL, P = 0.03). After calculation of a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for mucosal healing vs nonresponse, a trough level >8 μg/mL was associated with mucosal healing, with 67% sensitivity, 88% specificity, and a likelihood ratio of 3:4.Treatment with golimumab was associated with mucosal healing in 44% of all  patients. Higher golimumab levels were associated with mucosal healing in CD. These findings support the need for prospective studies to determine target golimumab levels in , which may impact current clinical practices in relation to selection of maintenance dosing.© 2019 Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation.

Here, we evaluated target-specific fluorescence-mediated tomography (FMT) for visualization of neutrophil infiltration in murine experimental DSS-induced colitis. Colitis was assessed using clinical, endoscopic, and histopathological parameters. Intestinal neutrophil infiltration was determined at day 0, 4, and 10 by targeted FMT after injection of a neutrophil-specific fluorescence-labelled monoclonal antibody (Gr-1). Complementary, immunofluorescence tissue sections with Gr-1 and ELISA-based assessment of tissue myeloperoxidase (MPO) served as the gold standard for the quantification of neutrophil infiltration. Colitic animals showed decreasing body weight, presence of fecal occult blood, and endoscopic signs of inflammation. FMT revealed a significantly increased level of fluorescence only four days after colitis induction as compared to pre-experimental conditions (pmol tracer 73.2 ± 18.1 versus 738.6 ± 80.7;  < 0.05), while neither body weight nor endoscopic assessment showed significant changes at this early time. Confirmatory, post-mortem immunofluorescence studies and measurements of tissue MPO confirmed the presence of increased neutrophil infiltration in colitic mice compared to controls. Concluding, Gr-1 targeted FMT can detect early colonic infiltration of neutrophils in experimental colitis even before clinical symptoms or endoscopic alterations occur. Therefore, FMT might be an important tool for repetitive and non-invasive monitoring of inflammatory cell infiltrate in intestinal inflammation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31614543>The Sulfate-Reducing Microbial Communities and Meta-Analysis of Their Occurrence during Diseases of Small-Large Intestine Axis.</a></h1><p>Sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) are often isolated from animals and people with ulcerative colitis and can be involved in the  development in the gut-intestine axis. The background of the research consisted of obtaining mixed cultures of SRB communities from healthy mice and mice with colitis, finding variation in the distribution of their morphology, to determine pH and temperature range tolerance and their possible production of hydrogen sulfide in the small-large intestinal environment. The methods: Microscopic techniques, biochemical, microbiological, and biophysical methods, and statistical processing of the results were used. The results: Variation in the distribution of sulfate-reducing microbial communities were detected. Mixed cultures from mice with ulcerative colitis had 1.39 times higher production of HS in comparison with samples from healthy mice. The species of  genus play an important role in diseases of the small-large intestine axis. Meta-analysis was also used for the observation about an SRB occurrence in healthy and not healthy individuals and the same as their metabolic processes. Conclusions: This finding is important for its possible correlation with inflammation of the intestine, where the present of SRB in high concentration plays a major part. It can be a good possible indicator of the occurrence of .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31657484>Mannose-capped lipoarabinomannan-induced B10 cells decrease severity of dextran sodium sulfate-induced inflammatory bowel disease in mice.</a></h1><p> (inflammatory bowel disease) is a chronic, non-specific, inflammatory gastrointestinal disease that mainly consists of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. However, the etiology and pathogenesis of  are still unclear. B10 (IL-10 producing regulatory B) cells, a subset of regulatory B cells, are known to contribute to intestinal homeostasis and the aberrant frequency of B10 cells is associated with . We have recently reported that B10 cells can be induced by ManLAM (mannose-capped lipoarabinomannan), a major cell-wall lipoglycan of M.tb (Mycobacterium tuberculosis). In the current study, the ManLAM-induced B10 cells were adoptively transferred into IL(interleukin)-10 mice and the roles of ManLAM-induced B10 cells were investigated in DSS (dextran sodium sulfate)-induced  model. ManLAM-induced B10 cells decrease colitis severity in the mice. The B10 cells downregulate Th1 polarization in spleen and MLNs (mesenteric lymph nodes) of DSS-treated mice.

The optimal use of this class of drugs requires careful management and a clear understanding of their properties. In this review article, we consider how to maximise the benefit of our most novel biological agents, vedolizumab and ustekinumab. For each agent, we consider practical aspects including dose flexibility, evidence for use in combination with a conventional immunomodulator and the potential role of therapeutic drug monitoring. We also address positioning of the various mechanisms and agents in treatment algorithms as well as important aspects of managing patients receiving monoclonal antibodies, such as disease reassessment. Finally, we look ahead to the future of monoclonal antibodies, where not only have biosimilars increased the number of agents available but there are also a range of novel mechanisms currently in late phase clinical trials.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

Recent studies have thus sought to identify a dietary component that can inhibit lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced nuclear factor-kappa beta (NF-κB) signaling to ameliorate . We now assessed if the lactic acid bacteria (LAB) from kimchi, suppresses the expression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) in peritoneal macrophages induced by LPS. Leuconostoc lactis EJ-1, an isolate from LAB, reduced the expression of interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-1β in peritoneal macrophages induced by LPS. We further tested whether EJ-1 alleviates colitis induced by 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS) in mice. TNBS significantly increased myeloperoxidase (MPO) expression, macroscopic colitis scores, and colon shortening. Oral administration of L. lactis EJ-1 resulted in an increase in TNBS-induced loss in body weight, colon shortening, MPO activity, and nuclear factor-kappa beta (NF-κB) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression; it also led to a marked reduction in cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression. L. lactis EJ-1 also inhibited the TNBS-induced expression of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6; however, it induced the expression of IL-10. M2 macrophage markers arginase I, IL-10 and CD206 were elevated by EJ-1. Collectively, these results suggest that EJ-1 inhibits the NF-κB signaling and polarizes M1 to M2- macrophage transition, which help in ameliorating colitis. This article is protected by copyright.

Current guidelines recommend an intensified surveillance strategy in these patients, although the evidence for this recommendation is conflicting. The aim of our study was to assess whether  patients with PIPs are at increased risk of colorectal neoplasia.We established a retrospective cohort in a tertiary  center with  patients undergoing colorectal cancer (CRC) surveillance in the current era. We compared cumulative incidences of colorectal neoplasia since  diagnosis between patients with and without PIPs and corrected for confounders. Second, we compared the risk of receiving a colectomy.In our cohort with >22 years of median follow-up, 154 of 519 patients had PIPs. PIPs were associated with extensive disease (odds ratio [OR], 2.76; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.61-4.42; P < 0.001) and with more severe inflammation at colonoscopy (OR, 3.54; 95% CI, 2.28-5.50; P < 0.001). After correction for confounders, the presence of PIPs was not associated with development of colorectal neoplasia (hazard ratio [HR], 1.28; 95% CI, 0.85-1.93; P = 0.24) or with development of advanced neoplasia (HR, 1.38; 95% CI, 0.52-3.68; P = 0.52). There was a higher risk of colectomy in patients with PIPs (HR, 3.41; 95% CI, 1.55-7.54; P = 0.002).In this cohort, PIPs were associated with disease extent, inflammation, and higher rates of colectomy. However, the presence of PIPs was not associated with the development of neoplasia. These findings suggest that patients with PIPs may not need an intensified surveillance strategy.© 2019 Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation.

Benefiting from the hydrophobic interactions and π-π stacking interactions of ATK, prodrug B-ATK-T could self-assemble into nanoparticles (NP) in water containing lecithin and DSPE-PEG. The morphology of B-ATK-T NP (approximate 100-120 nm) was confirmed to be regular spherical by transmission electron microscope. B-ATK-T NP was endowed high drug loading content with 41.23% for Bud and 15.55% for Tem. The rapid drug release from B-ATK-T NP proceeded in an extensive reactive oxygen species (ROS)-dependent manner. More than 98% of Bud and Tem in B-ATK-T NP could release in the mimic inflammation microenvironment or phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA)-stimulated macrophages within short time. The release of drugs in a simultaneous and proportional manner ensures that B-ATK-T NP can increase the combined efficacy of anti-inflammation and anti-oxidation. It is worth noting that B-ATK-T NP could be passively accumulated and dramatically increasing the maximum drugs concentration in the inflamed colon of mice with inflammatory bowel disease () by oral route, and avoiding potential systemic side effects. B-ATK-T NP could not only relieve colitis via inhibiting the expression of oxidative and proinflammatory mediators more than combination of free drugs, but also significantly reduce colitis-caused death. Taken together, the self-assembled, Janus-prodrug B-ATK-T NP is a promising candidate therapies for , even for other inflammatory diseases.Copyright © 2019.

Biological  agents have been available for the treatment of  for the last two decades, with impressive results. However, these drugs are costly and often have significant side-effects. Therefore, the benefit of aggressive treatment must be carefully balanced against the risk of serious adverse events. Despite good clinical outcomes, patients often request to discontinue the drugs because of cost and detrimental effects, especially the risk of malignancy.

In this study, we assessed the impact of early IFX discontinuation on mother's disease activity and on their at-risk babies.In a retrospective study of the Truven Health Analytics MarketScan database from 2011 to 2015, we compared  patients who discontinued IFX more than 90 days ("early IFX") with those who discontinue IFX 90 days or less ("late IFX) before delivery. We evaluated the risk of flaring, defined by new steroid prescriptions, visits to emergency room and/or hospital admissions, the pregnancy outcomes, and the at-risk babies.After IFX discontinuation, the early IFX group (68 deliveries) required significantly more steroid prescriptions than the late IFX group (318 deliveries) to control disease activity (P < 001). There were more preterm babies in the early IFX group (P < 049), but no difference within the 2 groups was noticed in the rate of intrauterine growth retardation, small for gestation, and stillborn babies. Similarly, there was no increase in acute respiratory infections, development delays, and congenital malformations in babies of the mothers from the late IFX vs early IFX groups.Steroid-free remission  mothers are at risk for disease flares and preterm babies when IFX is discontinued early in pregnancy. Continuation of IFX seems to be safe at least for the first year of life.© 2019 Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

NX-13 is a small molecule therapeutic designed to target and activate NLRX1 to induce immunometabolic changes resulting in lower inflammation and therapeutic responses in inflammatory bowel disease (). This study investigates the safety of NX-13 in a seven-day, repeat-dose general toxicity study in male and female Sprague Dawley rats at oral doses of 500 and 1000 mg/kg. Weights, clinical signs, functional observational battery, clinical pathology and histopathology were used for evaluation. Daily oral dosing of NX-13 up to 1000 mg/kg did not result in any changes in weight, abnormal clinical signs or behavior. No significant differences were observed between treated and control rats in hematology or blood biochemistry. Histopathological evaluation of 12 tissues demonstrated no differences between controls and treated rats. There were no changes in weights of brain, heart, kidney, liver or spleen. Pharmacokinetic analysis of a single oral dose of NX-13 at 10 mg/kg in Sprague Dawley rats provided a maximum plasma concentration of 57 ng/mL at 0.5 h post-dose. Analysis of colon tissue after oral dosing with 1 and 10 mg/kg indicated high peak concentrations (10 and 100 µg/g, respectively) that scale in a dose-proportional manner.

Tristetraprolin (TTP), an mRNA binding protein, plays a role in regulating the inflammatory factors, recognizing specific sequences on the 3' untranslated region of cytokine mRNAs. TTP activity depends on its phosphorylation state: the unphosphorylated TTP degrades pro-inflammatory cytokine mRNAs; on the contrary, the phosphorylated TTP fails to destabilize mRNAs furthering their expression. The phospho-TTP forms a complex with the chaperone protein 14-3-3. This binding could be one of the factors that promote intestinal inflammation as a cause of disease progression.To assess if TTP phosphorylation has a role in paediatric .The study was carried out on a cohort of paediatric  patients. For each patient enrolled, a specimen of inflamed and non-inflamed colonic mucosa was collected. Furthermore, the experiments were conducted on macrophages differentiated from blood samples of the same patients. Macrophages from healthy donors' blood were used as controls. Co-immunoprecipitation assay and immunoblotting analyses were performed to observe the formation of the phospho-TTP/14-3-3 complex. In the same samples TNF-α expression was also evaluated as major factor of the pro-inflammatory activity.In this work we studied indirectly the phosphorylation of TTP through the binding with the chaperone protein 14-3-3. In inflamed and non-inflamed colon mucosa of  paediatric patients immunoblot assay demonstrated a higher expression of the TTP in inflamed samples respect to the non-inflamed; the co-immunoprecipitated 14-3-3 protein showed the same trend of expression. In the  gene expression analysis higher levels of the cytokine in inflamed tissues compared to controls were evident. The same experiments were conducted on macrophages from  paediatric patients and healthy controls. The immunoblot results demonstrated a high expression of both TTP and co-immunoprecipitated 14-4-3 protein in -derived macrophages in comparison to healthy donors. TNF-α protein levels from macrophages lysates showed the same trend of expression in favour of  paediatric patients compared to healthy controls.In this work, for the first time, we describe a relation between phospho-TTP/14-3-3 complex and . Indeed, a higher expression of TTP/14-3-3 was recorded in  samples in comparison to controls.©The Author(s) 2019. Published by Baishideng Publishing Group Inc.

Topical tacrolimus is effective and safe in patients with refractory UP. However, it is not clear how tacrolimus suppositories fit into in the treatment algorithm of UP.We performed a randomized controlled, double-blind study at 8 hospitals in The Netherlands and Belgium from 2014 through 2017. Eighty-five patients with refractory UP (65% women) were randomly assigned to groups given once daily tacrolimus suppositories (2mg, n=43) or beclomethasone (3mg, n=42) for 4 weeks. The primary outcome was clinical response (decrease in Mayo score of 3 or more). Secondary outcomes included clinical remission, endoscopic response and remission, adverse events and quality of life. Outcomes were compared using Fisher's exact test and Mann-Whitney U test.Proportions of patients with clinical responses were 63% in the tacrolimus group and 59% in the beclomethasone group (P=.812); proportions of patients in clinical remission were 46% and 38%, respectively (P=.638). Proportions of patients with an endoscopic response were 68% and 60% in the tacrolimus group and in the beclomethasone group (P=.636); proportions in endoscopic remission rates were 30% and 13%, respectively (P=.092) Median increases in the inflammatory bowel disease questionnaire score were 18.0 in the tacrolimus group and 20.5 in the beclomethasone group (P=.395). Adverse event rates did not differ significantly between groups.In a 4-week randomized controlled trial, tacrolimus and beclomethasone suppositories induce comparable clinical and endoscopic responses in patients with UP refractory to 5-ASA. There were no significant differences in adverse events rates. Tacrolimus and beclomethasone suppositories are therefore each safe and effective treatment options for 5-ASA refractory disease.

Widespread aggregation of the α-synuclein protein in the form of Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites, and degeneration of substantia nigra dopamine neurons are the pathological hallmarks of PD. Inflammatory responses manifested by glial reactions, T cell infiltration, and increased expression of inflammatory cytokines, as well as other toxic mediators derived from activated glial cells, are currently recognized as prominent features of PD. Experimental, clinical and epidemiological data suggest that intestinal inflammation contributes to the pathogenesis of PD, and the increasing number of studies suggests that the condition may start in the gastrointestinal system years before any motor symptoms develop. Patients with inflammatory bowel disease () have a higher risk of developing PD compared with non- individuals. Gene association study has found a genetic link between  and PD, and an evidence from animal studies suggests that gut inflammation, similar to that observed in , may induce loss of dopaminergic neurons. Based on preclinical models of PD, it is suggested that the enteric microbiome changes early in PD, and gut infections trigger α-synuclein release and aggregation. In this paper, the possible link between  and PD is reviewed based on the available literature. Given the potentially critical role of gastrointestinal pathology in PD pathogenesis, there is reason to suspect that  or its treatments may impact PD risk.

The ability to identify patients at increased risk for development of anti-drug antibodies would facilitate selection of therapy and use of preventative strategies.We performed a genome-wide association study to identify variants associated with time to development of anti-drug antibodies in a discovery cohort of 1240 biologic-naïve patients with Crohn's disease starting infliximab or adalimumab therapy. Immunogenicity was defined as an anti-drug antibody titer ≥10 AU/ml in a drug-tolerant ELISA assay. Significant association signals were confirmed in a replication cohort of 178 patients with inflammatory bowel disease.The HLA-DQA1*05 allele, carried by approximately 40% of Europeans, significantly increased the rate of immunogenicity (hazard ratio [HR], 1.90; 95% CI, 1.60-2.25; P=5.88×10). The highest rates of immunogenicity, 92% at 1 year, were observed in patients treated with infliximab monotherapy who carried HLA-DQA1*05; conversely the lowest rates of immunogenicity, 10% at 1 year, were observed in patients treated with adalimumab combination therapy who did not carry HLA-DQA1*05. We confirmed this finding in the replication cohort (HR, 2.00; 95% CI, 1.35-2.98; P=6.60×10). This association was consistent for patients treated with adalimumab (HR, 1.89; 95% CI, 1.32-2.70) or infliximab (HR, 1.92; 95% CI, 1.57-2.33), and for patients treated with anti-TNF therapy alone (HR, 1.75; 95% CI, 1.37-2.22) or in combination with an immunomodulator (HR, 2.01; 95% CI, 1.57-2.58).In an observational study, we found a genome-wide significant association between HLA-DQA1*05 and the development of antibodies against anti-TNF agents. A randomized controlled biomarker trial is required to determine whether pretreatment testing for HLA-DQA1*05 improves patient outcomes by helping physicians select anti-TNF and combination therapies.

However, neither the underlying mechanism(s) of action nor their molecular target(s) are well defined. The orphan nuclear receptor Nurr1 (also known as NR4A2) is an essential transcription factor affecting the development and maintenance of midbrain dopaminergic neurons. In this study, using in vitro T cell differentiation models, we demonstrate that CQ activates T cell differentiation and induces Foxp3 gene expression in a Nurr1-dependent manner. Remarkably, CQ appears to induce Nurr1 function by two distinct mechanisms: firstly, by direct binding to Nurr1's ligand-binding domain and promoting its transcriptional activity and secondly by upregulation of Nurr1 expression through the CREB signaling pathway. In contrast, CQ suppressed gene expression and differentiation of pathogenic T17 cells. Importantly, using a valid animal model of inflammatory bowel disease (), we demonstrated that CQ promotes Foxp3 expression and differentiation of T cells in a Nurr1-dependent manner, leading to significant improvement of -related symptoms. Taken together, these data suggest that CQ ameliorates autoimmune diseases via regulating Nurr1 function/expression and that Nurr1 is a promising target for developing effective therapeutics of human inflammatory autoimmune diseases.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31623289>Simultaneous Assessment of Urinary and Fecal Volatile Organic Compound Analysis in De Novo Pediatric .</a></h1><p>Endoscopic evaluation is mandatory in establishing the diagnosis of pediatric inflammatory bowel disease (), but unfortunately carries a high burden on patients.

The sample included 53 ambulatory  patients (66% females) with ages from 18 to 65. Moderation analyses were conducted using structural equation modelling. Self-criticism exacerbated the associations of depression with  symptoms (b = 0.01; standard error [SE] = 0.00; Z = 3.73; P < .001) and illness shame (b = 0.02; SE = 0.01; Z = 2.40; P = .016). For the same level of  symptomatology or chronic illness-related shame, those individuals who present more feelings of inadequacy towards the self, experience more symptoms of depression. This exacerbation effect is stronger when  symptomatology and chronic illness-related shame are more intense. A high self-critical  patient may view the illness and/or symptomatology as a flaw or error that should be self-corrected. Physicians and other health professionals should be attentive to these pathological mechanisms and should attempt to alleviate them.

Inhibition of TNF can decrease the inflammatory response, and this approach has been used in therapy of autoimmune conditions, most effectively in inflammatory bowel disease (), rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis (also known as juvenile rheumatoid arthritis), psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis. Five anti-TNF antagonists have been developed and introduced into clinical medicine: a mouse-human chimeric monoclonal antibody to TNF (infliximab), two human monoclonal antibodies to TNF (adalimumab and golimumab), a humanized Fab fragment of anti-TNF linked to polyethylene glycol (certolizumab), and a soluble recombinant form of the TNF cellular receptor (etanercept) which, on binding, blocks the activity of TNF. These TNF antagonists have potent activity in several autoimmune diseases marked by excessive production of this proinflammatory cytokine. All five of these agents are approved for use in rheumatoid arthritis and are considered “disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs” (DMARDs), having been shown to decrease pain, improve function, and ameliorate progressive joint damage in rheumatoid arthritis. The monoclonal antibodies to TNF have also been shown to be effective in psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis and inflammatory bowel disease. The five agents rarely cause serum aminotransferase elevations, but have been linked to rare instances of clinically apparent, acute liver injury which often resembles autoimmune hepatitis and can be severe or require corticosteroid therapy. TNF antagonists are also immunosuppressive and can lead to reactivation of latent infections such as tuberculosis and hepatitis B. Severe and even fatal instances of reactivation of hepatitis B have been linked to several anti-TNF agents, and routine screening for HBsAg before starting therapy with these agents is recommended. Patients with HBsAg should receive prophylaxis with an oral antiviral agent during therapy with one of the TNF antagonists. Among the TNF antagonists, infliximab has been most frequently and etanercept least frequently linked to liver injury, including asymptomatic serum aminotransferase elevations, induction of clinically apparent autoimmune hepatitis, and reactivation of hepatitis B. However, infliximab has been most extensively used and studied than the other anti-TNF monoclonal antibodies, and liver injury due to these agents is probably class specific. For these reasons, all five of these agents should be considered potentially hepatotoxic, etanercept perhaps less so that the others.

Complications after bariatric surgery were recorded. Patients were matched 1:1 for age, sex,  subtype, phenotype, and location to patients with  who did not undergo bariatric surgery. Controls started follow-up at a time point in their disease similar to the disease duration in the matched case at the time of bariatric surgery. Inflammatory bowel disease medication usage and disease-related complications (need for corticosteroids, hospitalizations, and surgeries) among cases and controls were compared.Forty-seven patients met inclusion criteria. Appropriate matches were found for 25 cases. Median follow-up among cases (after bariatric surgery) and controls was 7.69 and 7.89 years, respectively. Median decrease in body mass index after bariatric surgery was 12.2. Rescue corticosteroid usage and -related surgeries were numerically less common in cases than controls (24% vs 52%; odds ratio [OR], 0.36; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.08-1.23; 12% vs 28%; OR, 0.2; 95% CI, 0.004-1.79).

Information about disease control, patient-reported outcomes (PROs), treatment patterns and use of healthcare resources is relevant to optimizing  management.To describe QoL and work productivity and activity impairment (WPAI), treatment patterns and use of healthcare resources among  patients in Brazil.A multicenter cross-sectional study included adult outpatients who were previously diagnosed with moderate to severe Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC). At enrolment, active CD and UC were defined as having a Harvey Bradshaw Index ≥ 8 or a CD Activity Index ≥ 220 or calprotectin > 200 µg/g or previous colonoscopy results suggestive of inadequate control (per investigator criteria) and a 9-point partial Mayo score ≥ 5, respectively. The PRO assessment included the QoL questionnaires SF-36 and EQ-5D-5L, the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ), and the WPAI questionnaire. Information about healthcare resources and treatment during the previous 3 years was collected from medical records. Chi-square, Fisher's exact and Student's -/Mann-Whitney  tests were used to compare PROs, treatment patterns and the use of healthcare resources by disease activity (α = 0.05).Of the 407 patients in this study (CD/UC: 64.9%/35.1%, mean age 42.9/45.9 years, 54.2%/56.6% female, 38.3%/37.1% employed), 44.7%/25.2% presented moderate-to-severe CD/UC activity, respectively, at baseline. Expressed in median values for CD/UC, respectively, the SF-36 physical component was 46.6/44.7 and the mental component was 45.2/44.2, the EQ-visual analog scale score was 80.0/70.0, and the IBDQ overall score was 164.0/165.0. Moderate to severe activity, female gender, being unemployed, a lower educational level and lower income were associated with lower QoL ( < 0.05).

In 1931 Haldane and Waddington published a landmark paper where they provided the probabilities of achieving any combination of alleles in 2-way RILs for 2 and 3 loci. In the case of sibling RILs where sisters and brothers are crossed at each generation, there has been no progress in treating 4 or more loci, a limitation we overcome here without much increase in complexity. In the general situation of  loci, the task is to determine 2  probabilities, but we find that it is necessary to first calculate the 4  "identical by descent" () probabilities that a RIL inherits at each locus its DNA from one of the four originating chromosomes. We show that these 4  probabilities satisfy a system of linear equations that follow from self-consistency. In the absence of genetic interference-crossovers arising independently-the associated matrix can be written explicitly in terms of the recombination rates between the different loci. We provide the matrices for  up to 4 and also include a computer program to automatically generate the matrices for higher values of . Furthermore, our framework can be generalized to recombination rates that are different in female and male meiosis which allows us to show that the Haldane and Waddington 2-locus formula is valid in that more subtle case if the meiotic recombination rate is taken as the average rate across female and male.

HE-chrysin more effectively inhibited BMDC maturation compared to chrysin, as demonstrated by the decreased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, surface molecules, antigen-presenting ability, and T cell proliferation/activation in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated BMDCs. These anti-inflammatory effects of HE-chrysin were regulated by mitogen-activated protein kinases and nuclear factor-κB. Furthermore, oral administration of HE-chrysin attenuated DSS-induced colitis symptoms and clinical signs in the mouse model.

Taking advantage of this possibility, TuMV virus-like particles (VLPs) have been genetically derivatized with a peptide from the chaperonin Hsp60, a protein described to be involved in inflammation processes and autoimmune diseases. Antibodies against the peptide have been previously shown to have a diagnostic value in at least one autoimmune disease, multiple sclerosis. The functionalized Hsp60-VLPs showed their significant increase in sensing potency when compared to monoclonal antibody detection of the peptide in a conventional immunoassay. Additionally, the developed Hsp60-VLPs allowed the detection of autoantibodies against the Hsp60 peptide in an in vivo mouse model of dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis. The detection of minute amounts of the autoantibodies allowed us to perform the analysis of their evolution during the progression of the disease. The anti-Hsp60 autoantibody levels in the sera of the inflamed mice went down during the induction phase of the disease. Increased levels of the anti-HSP60 autoantibodies were detected during the resolution phase of the disease. An extension of a previously proposed model for the involvement of Hsp60 in inflammatory processes is considered, incorporating a role for Hsp60 autoantibodies.

We reported these measures from 1990 to 2017 and stratified by region, socio-demographic index (SDI), gender and age group.The latest  prevalence and burden estimates varied widely across regions, and were particularly elevated in high-SDI countries. Despite an increasing prevalence from 1990 to 2017 (+6%), the  burden decreased (DALYs -12%). This decrease was driven by -associated premature mortality (YLLs -26%). This measure represented a high share of disease burden in low-SDI countries (86% of DALYs), whereas disability constituted the predominant component in high-SDI countries (71%) in 2017. Disease burden decreased particularly in children (DALYs -39% and YLLs -52%).

Relative fold difference in gene expression for 84 pain-associated genes was calculated using the 2-ΔΔ Cq method compared with pain-free controls. Factors affecting pain burden (Pain Burden Interview; PBI) were analyzed, including age, sex, rectal inflammation, and gene expression. Data were analyzed using multiple stepwise linear regression and 2-tailed t tests (P ≤ 0.05).Thirty-nine newly diagnosed  patients were included (65% male, mean age 12.75 years [SD 2.63], 23 Crohn's disease, 16 ulcerative colitis), along with 3 controls. Mean PBI score was 7.73 (SD 6.4, range 0 to 23) for all patients. Age and sex were not predictive of pain burden, but disease activity score was (P = 0.03). Expression of TRPV3, OPRM1, P2X3, SCN9A, PTGS2, and MAPK14 were associated with PBI score. Subsequent 2-tailed t tests comparing patients with no pain (PBI score ≦ 2, N = 11) to those with pain (PBI > 2, N = 28) confirmed differential expression of TRPV3, PTGS2, and MAPK14 was in patients with pain (all P < 0.05).Pain burden in newly diagnosed  patients may be linked to TRPV3, PTGS2, and MAPK14 expression, suggesting potential therapeutic targets for managing pain in .Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31666502>Gadd45β promotes regeneration after injury through TGFβ-dependent restitution in experimental colitis.</a></h1><p>Dysregulated immune responses and impaired function in intestinal epithelial cells contribute to the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (). Growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible 45 beta (Gadd45β) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of various inflammatory symptoms. However, the role of Gadd45β in  is completely unknown. This study aimed to evaluate the role of Gadd45β in . Gadd45β-KO mice exhibited drastically greater susceptibility to dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis and mortality than C57BL/6J mice. Bone marrow transplantation experiments revealed that Gadd45β functions predominantly in the intestinal epithelium and is critical during the recovery phase. Gadd45β regulates the TGF-β signaling pathway in colon tissue and epithelial cells by inhibiting Smurf-mediated degradation of TGF-β receptor type 1 via competitive binding to the N-terminal domain of Smad7. Furthermore, these results indicate that the Gadd45β-regulated TGF-β signaling pathway is involved in wound healing by enhancing epithelial restitution.

Most QoC projects or consensus statements are designed from the health care professional point of view. Having QoC indicators designed for and fully evaluable by patients may provide a key tool for external evaluation of QoC improvement measures. The aim of the IQCARO project was to identify indicators to measure QoC from the  patient's point of view.An extensive review of the literature to identify indicators of QoC was performed; first the identified indicators were reviewed by a steering committee including patients, nurses,  specialists, and methodologists. Then 2 focus groups of  patients analyzed the QoC indicators to determine whether they could be understood and evaluated by patients. The final QoC indicators were selected by a group of  patients using a Delphi consensus methodology.An initial list of 54 QoC indicators was selected by the steering committee. The QoC indicators were evaluated by 16 patients who participated in 2 focus groups. They identified 21 indicators that fulfilled the understandability and evaluability requirements. The 10 most relevant QoC indicators were selected by 26 patients with  using a Delphi consensus.

Inflammatory bowel diseases can even involve areas far away from the gut, such as the extraintestinal manifestations involving the oral cavity with the onset of aphthous-like ulcers (ALU). Studies carried out on animal models have shown that intestinal dysbiosis may be related to the development of autoimmune diseases, even if the mechanisms involved are not yet well known. The aim of this paper is to verify the hypothesis that in inflammatory bowel diseases patients, aphthous-like ulcers are the result of the concomitance of intestinal dysbiosis and other events, e.g., the microtraumas, occurring in the oral mucosa, and that  therapy with probiotics can be employed to modify the natural course of the aphthous-like ulcers.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31670610>Patient Experiences and Outcomes of a Telehealth Clinical Care Pathway for Postoperative Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients.</a></h1><p>       n    </p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31646851>Evaluation of cytokines levels as putative biomarkers to predict the pharmacological response to biologic therapy in inflammatory bowel diseases.</a></h1><p>Cytokines play a central role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel diseases.

Eucalyptus (L'Héritier 1789; the "eucalypts") are foundation tree species that provide essential habitat and modulate ecosystem services throughout Australia. Here we present a study of landscape genomic variation in two woodland eucalypt species, using whole genome sequencing of 388 individuals of Eucalyptus albens and Eucalyptus sideroxylon. We found exceptionally high genetic diversity (π ≈ 0.05) and low genome-wide, inter-specific differentiation (FST = 0.15) and intra-specific differentiation between localities (FST ≈ 0.01 - 0.02). We found no support for strong, discrete population structure, but found substantial support for isolation by geographic distance () in both species. Using generalised dissimilarity modelling, we identified additional isolation by environment (IBE). Eucalyptus albens showed moderate , and environmental variables have a small but significant amount of additional predictive power (i.e., IBE). Eucalyptus sideroxylon showed much stronger , and moderate IBE. These results highlight the vast adaptive potential of these species, and set the stage for testing evolutionary hypotheses of interspecific adaptive differentiation across environments.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31616860>Transforming Access to Specialist Care for Inflammatory Bowel Disease: The PACE Telemedicine Program.</a></h1><p>There are significant geographic disparities in the delivery of  healthcare in Ontario which may ultimately impact health outcomes.

PubMed was searched for original articles, published between 2007 and 2017, in Italian or English. The search string consisted of a combination of free text and MeSH terms with a common part that focused on HADs and a disease-specific part. All identified papers were screened by two independent reviewers; exclusion criteria were the following: no details of algorithms reported, algorithm not developed in the Italian context, exclusive use of data from the death certificate register, or from general practitioner or pediatrician databases. Pertinent papers were classified according to the objective for which the algorithm had been used, and only articles that used algorithms for primary objectives (I disease occurrence, II population/cohort selection, III outcome identification) were considered for algorithm extraction. The HADs used (hospital discharge records, drug prescriptions, etc.), ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes, ATC classification of drugs, followback periods, and age ranges applied by the algorithms have been reported. Further information on specific objective(s), accuracy measures, sensitivity analyses and the contribution of each HAD, have also been recorded.the search string led to the identification of 98 articles for , 42 articles for CD, and 390 for CKD. By screening the references, one paper for  was added. Finally, this led to 5, 9, and 8 pertinent papers respectively for , CD, and CKD. Considering the papers on  and CD, specific age selections were applied to focus on children and young adult populations. When a selection on age was applied for CKD, instead, it mostly considered individuals aged more than 18 years. Three algorithms for , 4 for CD, and 5 for CKD were extracted from papers and characterized. Drug prescription databases were used for both  and CKD algorithms, whereas the hospital discharge database and co-payment exemption database were used for  and CD. Pathology records and specialist visit databases were also used for CD and CKD, respectively. For each disease only one algorithm applied criteria for the exclusion of prevalent cases. External validation was performed only for Crohn's disease among IBDs, in one algorithm.the results of this review indicate that case identification for  and CD from routinely collected data can be considered feasible and can be used to perform different kinds of epidemiological studies.

We aimed to assess changes in cost of care, determine shifts in  cost-drivers, and examine differences by socioeconomic and insurance status over time.The Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS), a nationally representative database that collects data on health care utilization and expenditures from a nationally representative sample since 1998, was utilized. Adult subjects with  were identified by ICD-9 codes. To determine changes in per-patient costs or cost-drivers unique to , a control population of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) subjects was generated and matched in 1:1 case to control. Total annual health care expenditures were obtained and categorized as outpatient, inpatient, emergency, or pharmacy related. Temporal cohorts from 1998 to 2015 were created to assess change over time. Per-patient expenditures were compared by disease state and temporal cohort using weighted generalized linear models.A total of 641  subjects were identified and matched to 641 RA individuals. From 1998 to 2015, median total annual health care expenditures nearly doubled (adjusted estimate 2.20; 95% CI, 1.6-3.0) and were 36% higher in  compared with RA. In , pharmacy expenses increased 7% to become the largest cost-driver (44% total expenditures). Concurrently, inpatient spending in  decreased by 40%. There were no significant differences in the rate of change of cost-drivers in  compared with RA.Per-patient health care costs for chronic inflammatory conditions have nearly doubled over the last 20 years. Increases in pharmaceutical spending in  may be accompanied by reduction in inpatient care.

We sought to identify risk factors for CRC in this population.We compared sociodemographic and medical characteristics of patients who received a diagnosis of CRC at an age of 18-49 years (early-onset) with patients who received a diagnosis of CRC at an age of 50 years or older (late-onset) and with age-matched, cancer-free individuals (controls) at a tertiary academic hospital. We collected data from all adult patients with a diagnosis of CRC from January 1, 2011 through April 3, 2017 from electronic health records. Associations with risk factors were assessed using univariable and multivariable logistic regression models.We identified 269 patients with early-onset CRC, 2802 with late-onset CRC, and 1122 controls. Compared with controls, patients with early-onset CRC were more likely to be male (odds ratio [OR], 1.87; 95% CI, 1.39-2.51), have inflammatory bowel disease () (3% vs 0.4% for controls; univariable P<.01), and have a family history of CRC (OR, 8.61; CI, 4.83-15.75). Prevalence values of well-established modifiable CRC risk factors, including obesity, smoking, and diabetes, were similar. Compared to patients with late-onset CRC, patients with early-onset CRC were more likely to be male (OR, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.11-1.87), black (OR, 1.73; 95% CI, 1.08-2.65) or Asian (OR, 2.60; 95% CI, 1.57-4.15), and have  (OR, 2.97; 95% CI, 1.16-6.63) or a family history of CRC (OR, 2.87; 95% CI, 1.89-4.25). Sensitivity analyses excluding  and family history of CRC showed comparable results. Early-onset CRC was more likely than late-onset disease to be detected in the left colon or rectum (75% vs 59%, P=.02) and at a late stage of tumor development (77% vs 62%, P=.01).In a retrospective study of patients with early-onset CRC vs late-onset CRC or no cancer, we identified non-modifiable risk factors, including sex, race, , and family history of CRC, to be associated with early-onset CRC.Copyright © 2019 AGA Institute.

Accumulating data implicate a potential role of disturbed tryptophan metabolism in . Kynurenic acid (KYNA), a derivative of tryptophan (TRP) along the kynurenine (KYN) pathway, displays cytoprotective and immunomodulating properties, whereas 3-OH-KYN is a cytotoxic compound, generating free radicals.The expression of lymphocytic mRNA encoding enzymes synthesizing KYNA (KAT I-III) and serum levels of TRP and its metabolites were evaluated in 55 patients with , during remission or relapse [27 patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) and 28 patients with Crohn's disease (CD)] and in 50 control individuals.The increased expression of KAT1 and KAT3 mRNA characterized the entire cohorts of patients with UC and CD, as well as relapse-remission subsets. Expression of KAT2 mRNA was enhanced in patients with UC and in patients with CD in remission. In the entire cohorts of UC or CD, TRP levels were lower, whereas KYN, KYNA and 3-OH-KYN were not altered. When analysed in subsets of patients with UC and CD (active phase-remission), KYNA level was significantly lower during remission than relapse, yet not  control. Functionally, in the whole groups of patients with UC or CD, the TRP/KYN ratio has been lower than control, whereas KYN/KYNA and KYNA/3-OH-KYN ratios were not altered. The ratio KYN/3-OH-KYN increased approximately two-fold among all patients with CD; furthermore, patients with CD with relapse, manifested a significantly higher KYNA/3-OH-KYN ratio than patients in remission.The presented data indicate that  is associated with an enhanced expression of genes encoding KYNA biosynthetic enzymes in lymphocytes; however, additional mechanisms appear to influence KYNA levels. Higher metabolic conversion of serum TRP in  seems to be followed by the functional shift of KYN pathway towards the arm producing KYNA during exacerbation. We propose that KYNA, possibly  interaction with aryl hydrocarbon receptor or G-protein-coupled orphan receptor 35, may serve as a counter-regulatory mechanism, decreasing cytotoxicity and inflammation in . Further longitudinal studies evaluating the individual dynamics of TRP and KYN pathway in patients with , as well as the nature of precise mechanisms regulating KYNA synthesis, should be helpful in better understanding the processes underlying the observed changes.© The Author(s), 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31650411>Increased risk of herpes zoster infection in patients with inflammatory bowel disease: a meta-analysis of cohort studies.</a></h1><p>Previous studies have shown increased risk of herpes zoster (HZ) infection in patients with inflammatory bowel disease ().

Differences in this parameter can result from alterations in task-related cognitive states or from resting state processes. Nowadays, advanced imaging techniques such as fMRI are more frequently used and are acknowledged among both clinicians and radiologists in the diagnostic algorithm of digestive tract diseases. Functional dyspepsia is a condition in which neuroimaging allows for analysis of dysfunctions within the brain-gut axis (BGA) engaged in processing of visceral discomfort and pain. The results of studies in patient groups with irritable bowel syndrome prove that psychosocial factors significantly affect the mechanisms regulating visceral sensitivity within the brain. The BGA includes neuronal pathways (autonomic nervous system), neuroendocrine (hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis), and neuroimmunological ones. Psychological processes affect the functioning of the digestive system and can cause dyspeptic symptoms. A patient's mental condition associated with stress can affect processes taking place in the central nervous system and trigger somatic reactions in the digestive tract through the autonomic visceral system.Copyright: © 2019 Termedia Sp. z o. o.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31650573>Expert consensus: practical algorithms for management of inflammatory bowel disease patients presenting with back pain or peripheral arthropathies.</a></h1><p>Spondyloarthritis is the most frequent extra-intestinal manifestation of .To present simple strategies to identify and differentiate inflammatory joint pain in  patients.A panel of Belgian gastroenterologists and rheumatologists developed seven algorithms for  patients with joint symptoms based on a Delphi exercise conducted between April and December 2016.

The analysis of synovial fluid allows for identification of non-inflammatory (e.g., osteoarthritis) and inflammatory (e.g., [pseudo]-gout, peripheral spondyloarthritis and Borrelia burgdorferi arthritis) conditions. In patients with inflammatory oligoarticular or polyarticular arthralgia, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, concomitant therapies, anti-nuclear factor and anti-double-stranded DNA antibody levels should be evaluated; in anti-tumour necrosis factor-treated patients, a drug-induced lupus-like syndrome should be considered.We propose straightforward strategies for  patients with joint symptoms, which are specific enough to select initial treatment and referral pattern.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31616526>The importance of cognitive flexibility and flexibility in coping with stress for the quality of life in inflammatory bowel disease patients during biological therapy. A preliminary report.</a></h1><p>There are studies demonstrating the relation between psychological factors and efficiency of treatment in the course of inflammatory bowel diseases ().To investigate the relation between cognitive flexibility and flexibility in coping with stress and the quality of life, as well as the sense of satisfaction with life, in patients undergoing the biological treatment.The study group consisted of 33 adults who were diagnosed with Crohn's disease (CD) or ulcerative colitis (UC). The Flexibility in Coping with Stress Questionnaire (FCSQ-14), the Cognitive Flexibility Inventory (CFI), the Quality of Life SF36v2 Questionnaire, the Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS), and the socio-demographic questionnaire were used to gather the data.A total of 14 females and 19 males were included in this analysis. The results did not prove that the disease diagnosis (UC or CD) differed the level of psychological resources. However, older respondents achieved lower results in cognitive flexibility. A positive correlation was observed between both cognitive flexibility and flexibility in coping with stress and different dimensions of quality of life and satisfaction with life.There is a relationship between both cognitive flexibility and flexibility in coping with stress and health-related quality of life. These factors can be considered to be a kind of resource that helps to cope with challenges posed by a chronic illness, including .

In light of previous studies, we explored the therapeutic potential of IRF8 inhibition as immunomodulatory therapy for inflammatory bowel disease (). To this end, we utilized siRNA-loaded lipid-based nanoparticles (siLNPs) and demonstrated a ∼90% reduction of IRF8 mRNA levels in vitro (PV < 0.0001), alongside a notable reduction in IRF8 protein. Moreover, silencing IRF8 ex vivo in splenocytes lead to a profound downregulation of IRF8 protein, followed by an immunomodulatory effect, as represented by a decrease in the secretion of TNFα, IL6 and IL12/IL23 (IL12p40) proinflammatory cytokines (PV = 0.0045, 0.0330, <0.0001, respectively). In order to silence IRF8 in vivo, selectively in inflammatory leukocytes, we used siLNPs that were coated with anti-Ly6C antibodies via our recently published ASSET targeting approach. Through this strategy, we have demonstrated a selective binding of the targeted-LNPs (T-LNPs) to Ly6C + inflammatory leukocytes. Finally, an immunomodulatory effect was demonstrated in vivo in an  mouse model with a profound decrease of TNFα, IL6, IL12/IL23, and IL1β pro-inflammatory cytokines (n = 5, PV < 0.0001, <0.0001, <0.0001, 0.02, respectively) and an improvement of colon-morphology as assessed by colon-length measurements and colonoscopy (PV < 0.0001). Overall, using antibody-targeted siLNPs, we showed a notable reduction of IRF8 mRNA and protein and demonstrated a targeted immunomodulation therapeutic effect ex vivo and in vivo, in the DSS colitis model. We claim that a selective silencing of IRF8 in inflammatory leukocytes (such as Ly6C+) may serve as a therapeutic approach for treating inflammatory disorders.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

We investigated the mechanism by which α-MG reduces LPS-stimulated IEC-6 cells inflammation. A genome-wide examination of control, LPS-stimulated, and α-MG-pretreated cells was performed with the Illumina Hiseq sequencing platform, and gene expression was verified with quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). Among the 37,199 genes profiled, 2014 genes were regulated in the LPS group, and 475 genes were regulated in the α-MG group. GO enrichment and KEGG pathway analyses of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) showed that they were mainly related to inflammation and oxidative stress. Based on the transcriptomic results, we constructed a rat model of inflammatory bowel disease () with LPS and investigated the effects of α-MG on NLRP3 inflammasomes. After LPS stimulation, the rat intestinal villi were significantly detached, with congestion and hemorrhage; the intestinal epithelial cell nuclei were deformed; and the mitochondria were swollen. However, after pretreatment with α-MG, the intestinal villus congestion and hemorrhage were reduced, the epithelial nuclei were rounded, and the mitochondrial morphology was intact. qPCR and western blotting were used to detect NLRP3, caspase 1, interleukin (IL)-18, and IL-1β expression at the gene and protein levels. Their expression increased at both the transcript and protein levels after LPS stimulation, whereas it decreased after pretreatment with α-MG. This study provides new methods and ideas for the treatment of inflammation. α-MG may have utility as a drug for intestinal inflammation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31605016>Differential regulation of claudin-2 and claudin-15 expression in children and adults with malabsorptive disease.</a></h1><p>Intestinal Na-nutrient cotransport depends on claudin-2 and claudin-15 mediated Na recycling. Expression of these proteins is coordinately regulated during postnatal development. While expression of claudin-2 and claudin-15 has been studied in inflammatory bowel disease () and celiac disease (CD), it has not been assessed in other malabsorptive diseases, and no reports have compared expression in children and adults. We used quantitative immunofluorescence microscopy to assess claudin-2 and claudin-15 expression in duodenal biopsies from children and adults with malabsorptive disease and healthy controls. Consistent with previous work in rodents, claudin-2 expression in healthy children was markedly greater, and claudin-15 expression was less, than that in adults. Claudin-2 expression was increased in adults with CD and downregulated in children with graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). In contrast, claudin-15 expression was reduced in adults with GVHD and common variable immunodeficiency (CVID). These data show that one of the two Na/water pore-forming claudins is upregulated in CD and downregulated in GVHD and CVID. The specific claudin whose expression changes, however, reflects the age of the patient (child or adult). We conclude that contributions of claudin-2 and claudin-15 to pathophysiology of and responses to diarrhea in children and adults with GVHD and CVID differ from those in CD and .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31617572>Substrate-based kinase activity inference identifies MK2 as driver of colitis.</a></h1><p>Inflammatory bowel disease () is a chronic and debilitating disorder that has few treatment options due to a lack of comprehensive understanding of its molecular pathogenesis. We used multiplexed mass spectrometry to collect high-content information on protein phosphorylation in two different mouse models of . Because the biological function of the vast majority of phosphorylation sites remains unknown, we developed Substrate-based Kinase Activity Inference (SKAI), a methodology to infer kinase activity from phosphoproteomic data. This approach draws upon prior knowledge of kinase-substrate interactions to construct custom lists of kinases and their respective substrate sites, termed kinase-substrate sets that employ prior knowledge across organisms. This expansion as much as triples the amount of prior knowledge available. We then used these sets within the Gene Set Enrichment Analysis framework to infer kinase activity based on increased or decreased phosphorylation of its substrates in a dataset. When applied to the phosphoproteomic datasets from the two mouse models, SKAI predicted largely non-overlapping kinase activation profiles. These results suggest that chronic inflammation may arise through activation of largely divergent signaling networks. However, the one kinase inferred to be activated in both mouse models was mitogen-activated protein kinase-activated protein kinase 2 (MAPKAPK2 or MK2), a serine/threonine kinase that functions downstream of p38 stress-activated mitogen-activated protein kinase. Treatment of mice with active colitis with ATI450, an orally bioavailable small molecule inhibitor of the MK2 pathway, reduced inflammatory signaling in the colon and alleviated the clinical and histological features of inflammation. These studies establish MK2 as a therapeutic target in  and identify ATI450 as a potential therapy for the disease.© The Author(s) 2019. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

We performed a systematic search of four electronic databases, last updated in March, 2019. Data from studies comparing rates of surgery and postoperative complications in sarcopenic  patients versus non-sarcopenic  patients were pooled with the random-effects models. We calculated the odds ratios (OR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI). Ten studies with a collective total of 885  patients were included in our meta-analysis.

Growing evidences support the existence of exposure-response relationship with Vedolizumab, but the utility and the appropriate use of TDM in clinical practice is still under debate. In this review, we summarize all evidences supporting a TDM-guided approach for patients treated with Vedolizumab, suggesting three potential scenarios: 1) early prediction of long-term outcomes; 2) verifying the best strategy in case of loss of response, 3) maximizing therapeutic efficacy during maintenance treatment. Vedolizumab through concentrations < 20 μg/ml at week 6 and > 12 μg/ml seem to be associated with more favourable outcomes. No comparative studies have been conducted so far to demonstrate the advantage of adopting a TDM-guided versus an empirical approach for managing primary or secondary non responses.The frequency of antibodies to Vedolizumab detection is quite low (up to 4% in pivotal trials), suggesting, unlike of anti TNF-α agents, a low probability of experiencing an immune-mediated pharmacokinetic failure in clinical practice. Future prospective and controlled studies are warranted to establish the guidance on the use of a TDM-guided approach with Vedolizumab in clinical practice.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31602552>Prevalence and Molecular Subtyping of Blastocystis from Patients with Irritable Bowel Syndrome, Inflammatory Bowel Disease and Chronic Urticaria in Iran.</a></h1><p>Blastocystis is a parasite that colonizes in the human intestine. Its clinical features include diarrhea, abdominal pain, or urticarial and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Spite of being significant genetic diversity and numerous subtypes within the genus there were no associations between its subtypes and symptomatology.Aim of this project was subtyping of the protozoa in 184 Iranian people with history of IBS/ (n = 74) or chronic urticaria (n = 59) and individuals referred to general clinic (n = 51). Microscopic and molecular examinations used for identifying and subtyping of Blastocystis.Overall, frequency of the parasite was 24.46% while, 29.41% of people who referred to general clinic, 20.27%, and 25.42% of IBS/ and urticarial cases were infected, respectively. Subtyping result showed that 28.89% of all people were infected with Blastocystis sp. while the prevalence of ST3, ST2 and ST1 were 22.22%, 22.22%, and 17.78%, respectively. Blastocystis sp., was identified in most IBS/ cases (46.7%) followed with ST2 and ST3 (13.3 and 13.3, respectively). Whereas, in chronic urticaria group ST2(33.3%) was the major subtype and most individuals in control group were infected with ST3 (33.3%). Pearson's Chi Square test showed no significant differences between the parasite or subtype prevalence and diseases (p > 0.05).Given significant factors have effect on clinical signs including host or parasite genetics, microbiota, as well as environmental factors, it seems that further studies are needed to find out different markers of host susceptibility to diverse parasite genotypes in patients with irritable bowel syndrome or urticaria.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31611260>Uhrf1-Mediated Tnf-α Gene Methylation Controls Proinflammatory Macrophages in Experimental Colitis Resembling Inflammatory Bowel Disease.</a></h1><p>Macrophages drive the pathological process of inflammatory bowel diseases () mostly by secreting proinflammatory cytokines, such as Tnf-α. Recent studies have indicated the association between epigenetic modifications and macrophage functions. However, epigenetic mechanisms regulating macrophages' functional involvement in  remain unknown. In this study, we investigated whether the epigenetic regulator Uhrf1 plays a role in innate immunity by functionally regulating macrophages in intestines. We employed two transgenic strains of mice (one with Uhrf1 deficiency in macrophages [Uhrf1Lyz2-Cre mice] and the other with the two mutations at Uhrf1's DNA methylation regulatory site [Uhrf1 mice]) to assess their susceptibility to dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis. We examined the cytokines derived from Uhrf1Lyz2-Cre and Uhrf1 macrophages in response to LPS stimulation. We also analyzed the effects of proinflammatory cytokines on Uhrf1 expression in macrophages. The data demonstrated that Uhrf1 deficiency and Uhrf1 mutation resulted in severe colitis in the dextran sodium sulfate-treated mice. In vitro analysis revealed the hypomethylation of Tnf-α promoter and the increased Tnf-α expression in Uhrf1Lyz2-Cre and Uhrf1 macrophages in response to LPS stimulation, and anti-Tnf-α therapy implied the key role of Tnf-α to the aggravated colitis in Uhrf1-deficient mice. Exogenous Tnf-α destabilized Uhrf1 protein through ubiquitination-mediated protein degradation, triggering macrophage activation. In conclusion, we identified that Uhrf1-mediated DNA methylation controls Tnf-α expression of macrophages in the experimental colitis resembling .

Negative shifts in gut microbiota profiles, also known as dysbiosis, may be implicated in the development of chronic disorders such as inflammatory bowel diseases (). Adhesion molecule-dependent recruitment of immune cells to the gut is an important step in  pathogenesis. The adhesion molecule β7 integrin contributes to the development of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), intestinal immune cell homing, and immune responses and is known to promote intestinal inflammation. Although many studies underlined the role of the gut microbiota in shaping the mucosal immune system, studies on the influence of the host immune system on the microbiota are rare, especially in homeostasis. We addressed this question via comparative 16S rRNA gene amplicon analysis of fecal microbial communities from wild-type and β7 integrin-deficient mice, the latter being characterized by a compromised GALT. Besides subtle changes in relative abundances of  spp. and unknown members of the families  and , there was altogether no major difference in microbiota profiles in β7 integrin-deficient mice vs. wild-type littermates. This indicates that, in conditions of homeostasis, there is only a minor influence of the host immune system on the fecal microbiota in our mouse model, stressing the potential importance of pathological factors for dysbiosis development.Copyright © 2019 Babbar, Hitch, Pabst, Clavel, Hübel, Eswaran, Wagner and Schippers.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31616523>Assessment of sexual dysfunction in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.</a></h1><p>Inflammatory bowel disease () represents a diverse variety of chronic inflammatory intestinal conditions.

We sought to understand how acquired cellular and humoral immunity to the microbiota differ in health versus inflammatory bowel disease ().Resident memory T-cells (Trm) in colonic biopsies and local antibody responses to intraepithelial microbes were analyzed. Systemic antigen-specific immune T- and B-cell memory to a panel of commensal microbes was assessed.Systemically, healthy blood showed CD4 and occasional CD8 memory T-cell responses to selected intestinal bacteria but few memory B-cell responses. In , CD8 memory T-cell responses decreased although B-cell responses and circulating plasmablasts increased. Possibly secondary to loss of systemic CD8 T-cell responses in , dramatically reduced numbers of mucosal CD8+ Trm and γδ T-cells were observed. IgA responses to intraepithelial bacteria were increased. Colonic Trm expressed CD39 and CD73 ectonucleotidases, characteristic of regulatory T-cells. Cytokines/factors required for Trm differentiation were identified, and in vitro-generated Trm expressed regulatory T-cell function via CD39. Cognate interaction between T-cells and dendritic cells induced T-bet expression in dendritic cells, a key mechanism in regulating cell-mediated mucosal responses.A previously unrecognized imbalance exists between cellular and humoral immunity to the microbiota in , with loss of mucosal T-cell-mediated barrier immunity and uncontrolled antibody responses.

Demographic, endoscopic, and pathological findings were collected. According to the age of the patients, they were divided into 0-3 year-old group, 4-6 year-old group, 7-14 year-old group and 15-17 year-old group. The patients were also divided into 2005-2011 group and 2012-2017 group, according to the time of colonoscopy.The cohort consisted of 326 patients, including 205 boys (62.9%) and 121 girls (37.1%). In the study, 31 patients (9.5%) were in 0-3 year-old group, 28 (8.6%) were in 4-6 year-old group, 96 (29.4%) were in 7-14 year-old group and 171 (52.5%) in 15-17 year-old group. The terminal ileum intubation success rate was 90.5% (295/326). No serious complications such as hemorrhage or perforation occurred during the procedures. The cleaning effect was good in 92.3% (301/326) of the patients. A total of 204 patients (62.6%) received a positive diagnosis under colonoscopy. 27.0% (88/326) of the patients was diagnosed as nonspecific colitis or terminal ileitis. 46 (14.1%) with inflammatory bowel disease () and 39 (12.0%) with polyp. The diseases were significantly different among the different age groups. The highest  diagnostic rate was found in 0-3 year-old group (7/31, 22.5%), while the highest polyp finding rate was in 4-6 year-old group (8/28, 28.6%). The number of the patients in 0-3 year-old group was significantly increasing in 2012-2017 group compared with 2005-2011 group (27/191 vs. 4/135, P=0.001), while the terminal ileum intubation success rate was higher (179/191 vs. 116/135, P=0.037). However, comparisons between years 2005-2011 and 2012-2017 showed that neither  nor polyp detection rate changed significantly (P=0.850).Colonoscopy in pediatric patients was a safe and effective procedure. Colitis or terminal ileitis was the primary finding during colonoscopy while  was the second one, and polyp was the third.

However, the impact of stress on the risk of  onset remains unclear. The goal of the present study was to examine whether chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) could initiate or aggravate the onset of colon inflammation in rats which, in turn, would be capable of triggering bowel disease. We found that CUMS exposure increased infiltration of CD-45 positive cells and MPO activity, as well as augmented the expression of the inflammatory cytokines, IFN-γ and IL-6 within the colon of these rats. In addition, CUMS treatment changed the composition and diversity of gut microbiota and enhanced intestinal epithelial permeability, indicating the presence of a defect in the intestinal barrier. This CUMS-induced disruption of mucosal barrier integrity was associated with a reduction in expression of the tight junction protein, occludin 1, and an inhibition in mucosal layer functioning via reductions in goblet cells. Results from bacterial cultures revealed an increased presence of bacterial invasion after CUMS treatment as compared with that observed in controls. Thus, our data indicate that CUMS treatment induces alterations of the fecal microbiome and intestinal barrier defects, which facilitates bacterial invasion into colonic mucosa and further exacerbates inflammatory reactions within the colon. Accordingly, chronic stress may predispose patients to gastrointestinal infection and increase the risk of inflammation-related gut diseases.Copyright © 2019 Wei, Li, Tang, Sun, Chen, Wang, Liu, Yu, Yu, Liu and Ma.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31633167>Mucosal Eosinophilia Is an Independent Predictor of Vedolizumab Efficacy in Inflammatory Bowel Diseases.</a></h1><p>Peripheral and mucosal eosinophilia may be associated with more aggressive disease in inflammatory bowel disease () patients. Vedolizumab blocks T lymphocytes, eosinophil adhesion, and extravasation in the gastrointestinal tract. It is not known if mucosal eosinophilia is a predictor for the therapeutic efficacy of vedolizumab.This was a retrospective cohort study of  patients with ileal or colonic biopsies who were off steroids before starting vedolizumab. Biopsies were rereviewed by pathologists, and mean eosinophil density was quantified. Patient characteristics and steroid-free clinical response 6 months after beginning vedolizumab were determined. Features were compared between nonresponders and responders, and multivariable logistic regression was performed to identify predictors of clinical response.Of 251  patients starting vedolizumab therapy, 65 patients (48% Crohn's disease, 52% ulcerative colitis) met inclusion criteria. All  patients not responding to vedolizumab were more likely to have a higher baseline mean eosinophil count (340 ± 156 vs 236 ± 124; P = 0.004), be previously exposed to an anti-TNF (96% vs 56%; P = 0.001), and be male (58% vs 28%; P = 0.02). Mean eosinophil counts were significantly increased in colonic biopsies in UC nonresponders (438 ± 149 vs 299 ± 145; P = 0.01). A similar trend was seen in CD nonresponders. On multivariable analysis, colonic eosinophil density and prior anti-TNF exposure-and the combination of both-were independent predictors of response.In ulcerative colitis, colonic eosinophilia and prior anti-TNF exposure were independent predictors of 6-month clinical nonresponse to vedolizumab. Mucosal eosinophil density as a novel biomarker should be explored in larger patient cohorts.Aside from the previous anti-TNF exposure, eosinophil density in the colon of patients with UC is a negative predictor for a steroid-free long-term response to vedolizumab. The degree colonic eosinophilia may be a novel biomarker that should be further explored.© 2019 Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

However, whether miR-219a-5p is involved in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease () remains elusive. In this study, we demonstrated that miR-219a-5p expression was significantly decreased in the inflamed intestinal mucosa and peripheral blood (PB)-CD4 T cells from patients with . Proinflammatory cytokines (e.g., IL-6, IL-12, IL-23 and TNF-α) inhibited miR-219a-5p expression in CD4 T cells in vitro. Lentivirus-mediated miR-219a-5p downregulation facilitated Th1/Th17 cell differentiation, whereas miR-219a-5p overexpression exerted an opposite effect. Luciferase assays confirmed that ETS variant 5 (ETV5) was a functional target of miR-219a-5p and ETV5 expression was significantly increased in the inflamed intestinal mucosa and PB-CD4 T cells from  patients. ETV5 overexpression enhanced Th1/Th17 immune response through upregulating the phosphorylation of STAT3 and STAT4. Importantly, supplementation of miR-219a-5p ameliorated TNBS-induced intestinal mucosal inflammation, characterized by decreased IFN-γ CD4 T cells and IL-17A CD4 T cells infiltration in the colonic lamina propria.

The treat-to-target strategy, emphasizing proactive assessment and optimizing treatment, is commonly applied in the clinical setting. Although colonoscopies are essential for this strategy to be successful, bowel preparation and sedative drugs are required for paediatric patients. We attempted to verify the usefulness of sigmoidoscopy, which is less invasive than colonoscopy, combined with faecal calprotectin, to assess mucosal healing.A total of 58 paediatric patients diagnosed with ulcerative colitis and followed up at Severance Children's Hospital from March 2015 to May 2018 were enrolled. Clinical data and laboratory findings (including faecal calprotectin and endoscopic data) were collected from medical records. The predictive power of mucosal healing of sigmoid colon and rectum (s-MH) combined with faecal calprotectin to predict mucosal healing throughout the colon was analysed.Among 58 patients (mean age 16.13 ± 2.88 years), 18 (31.0%) were in mucosal healing status. The median faecal calprotectin level was 486.5 μg/g. The faecal calprotectin cutoff value for predicting mucosal healing, identified using receiver-operating characteristic analyses, was 148 μg/g (area under the curve, 0.81). Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of s-MH in predicting mucosal healing were 1.0, 0.82, 0.72, and 1.0, respectively. When we combined s-MH with faecal calprotectin less than the cutoff value, the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were 0.56, 1.0, 1.0, and 0.83, respectively.For patients with a low faecal calprotectin level, sigmoidoscopy might be sufficient to assess mucosal healing.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31614860>Chronic Stress, Inflammation, and Colon Cancer: A CRH System-Driven Molecular Crosstalk.</a></h1><p>Chronic stress is thought to be involved in the occurrence and progression of multiple diseases, via mechanisms that still remain largely unknown. Interestingly, key regulators of the stress response, such as members of the corticotropin-releasing-hormone (CRH) family of neuropeptides and receptors, are now known to be implicated in the regulation of chronic inflammation, one of the predisposing factors for oncogenesis and disease progression. However, an interrelationship between stress, inflammation, and malignancy, at least at the molecular level, still remains unclear. Here, we attempt to summarize the current knowledge that supports the inseparable link between chronic stress, inflammation, and colorectal cancer (CRC), by modulation of a cascade of molecular signaling pathways, which are under the regulation of CRH-family members expressed in the brain and periphery. The understanding of the molecular basis of the link among these processes may provide a step forward towards personalized medicine in terms of CRC diagnosis, prognosis and therapeutic targeting.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31602970>Anti-TNF Combination Therapy in Inflammatory Bowel Disease: de novo or selective?</a></h1><p>Anti-TNFs still remain the backbone of advanced therapies in inflammatory bowel diseases, but their efficacy is not universal and tends to diminish over time. As a consequence, there is the need for optimization of these treatments, and the use of combination therapy - i.e. an anti-TNF plus an immunosuppressant - is one of the main strategies. The rationale for this approach lies in the evidence that the immunosuppressant reduces the formation of antibodies directed against the anti-TNF, thus avoiding the reduction or elimination of circulating drug levels, and in the combination of the therapeutic effect of two drugs. Nowadays, two different combination therapies should be distinguished. In the "de novo" combination therapy, the anti-TNF is used in combination with an immunosuppressant from the beginning of the treatment, in order to prevent the formation of anti-drug antibodies. In the "selective" combination therapy, the immunosuppressant is added at a later time in patients who experience a loss of response during anti-TNF monotherapy due to the development of anti-drug antibodies. The purpose of this review is to summarize the available evidence on both de novo and selective combination therapy. In addition, we will express our point of view on the choice between these two different treatment modalities.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31624009>Nutritional and dietary strategy in the clinical care of inflammatory bowel disease.</a></h1><p>The incidence and prevalence of inflammatory bowel disease have been increasing for decades and  has become a worldwide disease. Epidemiology studies demonstrated higher incidence rates in the more westernized countries. The change of habitual diets in these countries is perceived as the reason for the development of . Besides, molecular biological studies showed some pathogenic substances produced after digestion of daily diet decrease the diversity of intestinal microbiota and cause dysbiosis of microbiome. Then, chronic inflammation occurs in some genetically susceptible subjects and  developed. As a result, many researchers started to investigate the potential therapeutic effects of nutrients and dietary intervention on the clinical course and pathogenesis of . Carbohydrates, fats, proteins and fibers are investigated and their molecular roles in the inflammatory process are discovered gradually. The undigested carbohydrates are proved to cause overgrowth of colonic bacteria and inflammation occurs by altering colonic microbiome. ω-3 poly-unsaturated fatty acids are more favored over ω-6 poly-unsaturated fatty acids due to its less pro-inflammatory properties. High fibers produce more short-chain fatty acids in colon and facilitate the diversity of colonic microbiota. Moreover, some dietary interventions were designed and studied with promising results. Low FODMAP is recommended in IBS and is also suggested in patients of  with IBS-like symptoms. Specific Carbohydrate Diet was designed for celiac disease at first and is proved to be effective to decrease inflammation and to induce remission by decreasing non-digested carbohydrates into colon. Exclusive Enteral Nutrition has been investigated and is suggested to be the first line of management in pediatric CD in many literatures. Paleolithic diet and semi-vegetarian diet are evaluated and might be beneficial in some clinical settings. These findings are promising but limited to the evidence without high quality level. Some more well-designed studies with randomization and double-blind are needed and the primary endpoints should be more focused on the decrease of inflammation in pathology and mucosal healing in endoscopy instead of relief of the symptoms.Copyright © 2019.

All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), a key vitamin A metabolite, was earlier shown by us to stimulate DRA expression in intestinal epithelial cells. However, its role in modulating DRA in gut inflammation has not been investigated.Our aim was to analyze the efficacy of ATRA in counteracting inflammation-induced decrease in DRA in vitro and in vivo.Interferon-γ (IFN-γ)-treated Caco-2 cells and dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-treated C57BL/6J mice served as in vitro and in vivo models of gut inflammation, respectively. The effect of ATRA on IFN-γ-mediated inhibition of DRA function, expression, and promoter activity were elucidated. In the DSS colitis model, diarrheal phenotype, cytokine response, in vivo imaging, myeloperoxidase activity, and DRA expression were measured in the distal colon.All-trans retinoic acid (10 μM, 24 h) abrogated IFN-γ (30 ng/mL, 24 h)-induced decrease in DRA function, expression, and promoter activity in Caco-2 cells. All-trans retinoic acid altered IFN-γ signaling via blocking IFN-γ-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT-1. All-trans retinoic acid cotreatment (1 mg/kg BW, i.p. daily) of DSS-treated mice (3% in drinking water for 7 days) alleviated colitis-associated weight loss, diarrheal phenotype, and induction of IL-1β and CXCL1 and a decrease in DRA mRNA and protein levels in the colon.Our data showing upregulation of DRA under normal and inflammatory conditions by ATRA demonstrate a novel role of this micronutrient in alleviating -associated diarrhea.© 2019 Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation.

These changes are directly related to the content of OMSW in the growing substrate. Using dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-in-flammatory bowel disease () mice model, we measured the colonic inflammatory response to the different glucan preparations. We found that the histology damaging score (HDS) resulting from DSS treatment reach a value of 11.8 ± 2.3 were efficiently downregulated by treatment with the fungal extracted glucans. Glucans extracted from stalks cultivated at 20% OMSW downregulated to a HDS value of 6.4 ± 0.5 whereas those cultivated at 80% OMSW showed the strongest effects (5.5 ± 0.6). Similar downregulatory effects were obtained for expression of various intestinal cytokines. All tested glucans were equally effective in regulating the number of CD14/CD16 monocytes from 18.2 ± 2.7% for DSS to 6.4 ± 2.0 for DSS + glucans extracted from stalks cultivated at 50% OMSW. We tested the effect of glucans on lipopolysaccharide-induced production of TNF-α, which demonstrated that stalk-derived glucans were more effective than caps-derived glucans. Isolated glucans competed with anti-Dectin-1 and anti-CR3 antibodies, indicating that they contain β-glucans recognized by these receptors. In conclusion, the most effective glucans in ameliorating -associated symptoms induced by DSS treatment in mice were glucan extracts prepared from the stalk of P. eryngii grown at higher concentrations of OMSW.

Among 1125 patients with ulcerative colitis (UC), 774, 294, and 57 initiated infliximab, adalimumab, and golimumab, respectively. Rates of non-persistence and switching were higher in UC than in CD. One- and 3-year non-persistence rates were 14.2% and 26.5% in CD and 35.4% and 53.4% in UC, respectively. One- and 3-year switching rates were 3.7% and 10.1% in CD and 15.6% and 22.0% in UC, respectively. In both CD and UC, infliximab and adalimumab initiators showed similar persistence rates, whereas adalimumab initiators had a higher risk of switching than infliximab initiators. In UC, golimumab initiators had a higher risk of non-persistence and switching than infliximab initiators. Steroid use at biologic initiation was associated with an increased risk of non-persistence and switching in both CD and UC. UC patients who started biologic treatment at tertiary hospitals were more likely to continue treatment than those who started at general hospitals/community hospitals/clinics.In real-world clinical practice settings, discontinuation of biologics occurred frequently in  patients, and switching of biologics was common in UC patients.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31662858>The gut virome in inflammatory bowel disease pathogenesis: From metagenomics to novel therapeutic approaches.</a></h1><p>The association of intestinal dysbiosis with the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease has been well established. Besides bacteria, microbiota comprises yeasts, archaea, protists and viruses, neglected actors in inflammatory bowel disease-associated microbiota. In the past, a great limitation in studying microbiota composition was the low sensitivity of sequencing technologies and that few computational approaches were sufficient to thoroughly analyse the whole microbiome. However, new cutting-edge technologies in nucleic acid sequencing, -omics analysis and the innovative statistics and bioinformatics pipelines made possible more sensitive and accurate metagenomics, ultimately identifying novel players in intestinal inflammation, including prokaryotic and eukaryotic viruses, that together form the gut virome. The discovery of peculiar inflammatory bowel disease-associated microbial strains will not only shed new light on inflammatory bowel disease aetiogenesis, they may also support the development of novel therapeutic strategies not merely treating symptoms, but precisely counteracting the primary cause of chronic intestinal inflammation.© Author(s) 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31631555>Dermatological complications of therapy with biologics in inflammatory autoimmune diseases.</a></h1><p>Cutaneous adverse events (CAEs) occur in up to 10 % of patients with immune-mediated inflammatory disease (IMID) treated with antitumor necrosis factor (TNF)α agents. The aim of this clinical study was to track and observe the course of CAEs in all biologic therapies.The population for this study consisted of patients with CAEs under biologic therapy who were examined by experienced board-certified dermatologists in the outpatient department of the University Hospital Essen, Department of Dermatology.Altogether 39 patients with a total of 45 CAEs were included in this study. In 60 % of the cases a form of paradoxical psoriasis was diagnosed. Two thirds (66.6 %) of the patients with CAEs were diagnosed with an underlying inflammatory bowel disease (). TNFα antagonists were the triggering agents in about 95 % of the cases. Changes in biological therapy were required in nearly half of the cases (46.2 %). Almost 90 % of the patients had either a complete (42.1 %) or a partial response (47 %).Management of CEAs under biological therapy can be challenging in clinical practice.

In view of recent advances in diagnosis and treatment, we sought to understand their current knowledge and working practices.A Web-based survey was advertised to chiropractors and osteopaths via the Royal College of Chiropractors and the Institute of Osteopathy.Of 382 completed responses [237 chiropractors (62%) and 145 osteopaths (38%)], all were familiar with AS, but only 63 and 25% were familiar with the terms axSpA and non-radiographic axSpA, respectively. Seventy-seven per cent were confident with inflammatory back pain. Respondents routinely asked about  (91%), psoriasis (81%), acute anterior uveitis (49%), peripheral arthritis (71%), genitourinary/gut infection (56%), enthesitis (30%) and dactylitis (20%). Eighty-seven per cent were aware of the association between axSpA and HLA-B27. Only 29% recognized that axSpA was common in women. Forty per cent recommend an X-ray (pelvic in 80%) and, if normal, 27% would recommend MRI of the sacroiliac joints and whole spine. Forty-four per cent were aware of biologic therapies. Forty-three per cent were confident with the process of onward referral to rheumatology via the general practitioner (GP). The principal perceived barrier to onward referral was reluctance by the GP to accept their professional opinion.Overall knowledge of ankylosing spondylitis is good, but the term axSpA is poorly understood. Specific learning needs include gender preponderance, awareness of acute anterior uveitis and the availability of biological therapies. There is lack of confidence in the onward referral process to rheumatology via the GP.© The Author(s) 2019.

Although the underlying mechanisms of  remain unclear, growing evidence has shown that dysregulated immune system reactions in genetically susceptible individuals contribute to mucosal inflammation. However, conventional treatments have been effective in inducing remission of  but not in preventing the relapse of them. In this way, mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) therapy has been recognized as a promising treatment for  due to their immunomodulatory properties, ability to differentiate into several tissues, and homing to inflammatory sites. Even so, literature is conflicted regarding the location and persistence of MSC in the body after transplantation. For this reason, recent studies have focused on the paracrine effect of the biofactors secreted by MSC, especially in relation to the immunomodulatory potential of soluble factors (cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors) and extracellular vehicles that are involved in cell communication and in the transfer of cellular material, such as proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids. Moreover, treatment with interferon-γ, tumor necrosis factor-α, and interleukin-1β causes MSC to express immunomodulatory molecules that mediate the suppression  cell-contact dependent mechanisms. Taken together, we present an overview of the role of bioactive factors and cell membrane proteins derived from MSC as a cell-free therapy that can improve  treatment.©The Author(s) 2019.

Impaired intestinal iron absorption due to inflammatory cytokines is thought to play a role in ACI. We undertook for the first time a controlled prospective study investigating effects of differing underlying diseases, disease locations, and types of iron deficiency or anaemia on oral iron absorption in adult  patients with and without inflammation.This study was a comparative, single-centred open clinical trial in adults with  [n = 73] and healthy controls [n = 22]. Baseline parameters included blood count, iron status [ferritin, transferrin, transferrin saturation, soluble transferrin receptor, hepcidin, serum iron], high-sensitivity C-reactive protein [hsCRP] and interleukin-6. Iron absorption was tested using one oral, enteric-coated capsule containing 567.7 mg iron[II]-glycine-sulphate complex. Serum iron was determined 60/90/120/180/240 min after ingestion.Iron absorption capacity was shown to be influenced by inflammation and anaemia or iron deficiency [ID] type but not by underlying disease type or localisation. The ACI group showed a significantly lower iron absorption capacity than all others. Whereas hsCRP levels [-0.387, p < 0.001], IL-6 [-0.331, p = 0.006], ferritin [-0.531, p < 0.001], and serum hepcidin [-0.353, p = 0.003] correlated negatively with serum iron change at 2 h, transferrin showed a positive correlation at the same time point [0.379, p < 0.001].Underlying disease type and localisation appear to have little effect on iron absorption capacity, whereas lack of response to oral iron correlates well with serum markers of inflammation. Iron absorption capacity is thus significantly reduced in the presence of inflammation.Copyright © 2019 European Crohn’s and Colitis Organisation (ECCO). Published by Oxford University Press.

In this study, we tested an illness stigma → health communication difficulties → thwarted belongingness → depressive symptoms serial mediation model.

Criterion validity of presence of EAMs, osteoporosis and fractures was assessed as agreement (kappa) between patients' self-reported and physician-confirmed disease. Construct validity of the mSCQ including EAMs, osteoporosis and/or fractures (SpA-SCQ) was assessed by testing hypotheses about correlations with demographics, physical function, work ability, health utility and disease activity, and was compared with construct validity of the rheumatic disease comorbidity index.In total, 3984 patients contributed to the analyses. Agreement between patient-reported and physician-reported EAMs was substantial to almost perfect (uveitis ĸ = 0.81,  ĸ = 0.73, psoriasis ĸ = 0.86). Agreement for osteoporosis (ĸ = 0.38) and fractures (ĸ = 0.39) was fair. As hypothesized, the mSCQ correlated moderately to weakly with age, physical function, work limitations and health utility, and very weakly with disease activity.

These effector-host protein interactions are often dynamic and transient in nature, making them difficult to identify using traditional interaction-based methods. Here, we performed a systematic comparison between proximity-dependent biotin labelling (BioID) and immunoprecipitation coupled with mass spectrometry to investigate a series of Salmonella type 3 secreted effectors that manipulate host intracellular trafficking (SifA, PipB2, SseF, SseG and SopD2). Using BioID, we identified 632 candidate interactions with 381 unique human proteins, collectively enriched for roles in vesicular trafficking, cytoskeleton components and transport activities. From the subset of proteins exclusively identified by BioID, we report that SifA interacts with BLOC-2, a protein complex that regulates dynein motor activity. We demonstrate that the BLOC-2 complex is necessary for SifA-mediated positioning of Salmonella-containing vacuoles, and affects stability of the vacuoles during infection. Our study provides insight into the coordinated activities of Salmonella type 3 secreted effectors and demonstrates the utility of BioID as a powerful, complementary tool to characterize effector-host protein interactions.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31599462>Symptoms among emerging adults with inflammatory bowel disease: a descriptive study.</a></h1><p>Individuals with inflammatory bowel disease () are commonly diagnosed when they are between the ages of 18-29, a developmental period known as emerging adulthood.

The aim of this study was to identify risk factors for nonadherence.This was a single-center retrospective study evaluating patients with  treated at a tertiary care center and prescribed self-injectable biologic therapy using the center's specialty pharmacy. Adherence was defined using medication possession ratio (MPR). Nonadherence was defined as MPR <0.86.Four hundred sixty patients (n = 393 with CD and n = 67 with UC) were evaluated with mean MPR (interquartile range) equaling 0.89 (0.48-1). Overall, 69% of patients were adherent (defined as MPR ≥0.86), 66% of patients with CD and 87% of patients with UC. In univariate analysis, several factors increased risk of nonadherence: CD diagnosis, insurance type, psychiatric history, smoking, prior biologic use, and narcotic use (P < 0.05). In multivariable analysis, Medicaid insurance (odds ratio [OR], 5.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.85-15.6) and CD diagnosis (OR, 2.8; 95% CI, 1.3-6.0) increased risk of nonadherence. In CD, as the number of risk factors increased (narcotic use, psychiatric history, prior biologic use, and smoking), the probability of nonadherence increased. Adherence was 72% in patients with 0-1 risk factors, decreasing to 62%, 61%, and 42% in patients with 2, 3, and 4 risk factors, respectively (P < 0.05).This study identified risk factors for nonadherence to biologic therapy. In patients with CD, the probability of nonadherence increased as the number of risk factors increased.Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation 2019.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31652976>Long Non-Coding RNA GAS5 and Intestinal MMP2 and MMP9 Expression: A Translational Study in Pediatric Patients with .</a></h1><p>The long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) growth arrest-specific transcript 5 () seems to be involved in the regulation of mediators of tissue injury, in particular matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease ().

Alcohol consumption was found in both groups, but Arabs smoked more (46% vs. 12%, respectively, P < 0.05). Obstructive phenotype was lower in Arabs (10% vs. 32%, P < 0.05). 5-aminosalicylic acid and anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha were prescribed for the Arab and Ashkenazi groups (89% and 21%, respectively). The need for surgical intervention due to disease severity and/or complications was not significant (22% vs. 24%).Despite similar reports of NOD2/CARD15 mutations, Crohn's disease is more common than ulcerative colitis within the Arab-Israeli population.

Aneuploidy rescue can restore euploidy but may result in uniparental disomy (UPD), the inheritance of both homologs of a chromosome from one parent with no representative copy from the other. Current understanding of UPD is limited to ∼3,300 case subjects for which UPD was associated with clinical presentation due to imprinting disorders or recessive diseases. Thus, the prevalence of UPD and its phenotypic consequences in the general population are unknown. We searched for instances of UPD across 4,400,363 consented research participants from the personal genetics company 23andMe, Inc., and 431,094 UK Biobank participants. Using computationally detected DNA segments identical-by-descent () and runs of homozygosity (ROH), we identified 675 instances of UPD across both databases. We estimate that UPD is twice as common as previously thought, and we present a machine-learning framework to detect UPD using ROH. While we find a nominally significant association between UPD of chromosome 22 and autism risk, we do not find significant associations between UPD and deleterious traits in the 23andMe database.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

However, extensive studies showed that microalgae are rich in lutein content and potentially exploitable for its dietary and other industrial applications. In this study, microwave assisted binary phase solvent extraction method (MABS) was the novel protocol being developed and optimized to achieve maximum lutein recovery from microalgae Scenedesmus sp. biomass. Results showed that 60% potassium hydroxide solution with acetone in the ratio of 0.1 (ml/ml) was the ideal binary phase solvent composition. Empirical model developed using response surface methodology revealed highest lutein content can be recovered through MABS extraction method at 55 °C treatment temperature, 36 min in extraction time, 0.7 (mg/ml) for biomass to solvent ratio, 250 Watt microwave power and 250 rpm stirring speed. This optimized novel protocol had increased the amount of lutein recovered by 130% and shorten the overall extraction time by 3-folds.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

In many cases, the diagnosis of ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease is straightforward, especially when patients have a typical presentation and characteristic histopathological features. Knowledge of the full clinical history is very important, particularly past and recent medical history, drug history, foreign travel, or known contact with individuals with specific infection. Discussion of all cases of suspected  within a multidisciplinary team meeting is required to ensure that clinical, radiological, and pathological features can be correlated. Mimics of  can be divided into 4 categories: 1) those due to specific infection, 2) those due to a specific localized inflammatory process, 3) those due to iatrogenic causes, and 4) other rarer causes. Accurate diagnosis of  and exclusion of these mimics are crucial for patient management. Once a diagnosis of  has been proffered by a pathologist, it is very difficult to "undiagnose" the condition when an alternative diagnosis or "mimic" has been subsequently identified. The histological diagnosis of each of these  mimics is discussed in detail, with guidance on how to avoid the pitfall of missing these sometimes very subtle and "difficult to diagnose" conditions.© 2019 Crohn's & Colitis Foundation.

We aimed to calculate the relative hazard of CKD among patients with , adjusted for CKD risk factors, and to determine whether  medications are associated with change in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).We performed a retrospective cohort study of data from The Health Improvement Network. Patients with  (n=17,807) were matched for age, sex, and practice to individuals without  (n=63,466). The relative hazard of CKD, stages 3 through 5D, in patients with  was calculated using a Cox proportional hazards model adjusted for common CKD risk factors. We also evaluated the association of 5-ASAs, azathioprine, and methotrexate with change in eGFR using a longitudinal model.After we controlled for risk factors associated with CKD, we found  to be associated with development of CKD in patients 16-77 years old. As patient age increased, the adjusted hazard ratio for CKD decreased monotonically, from 7.88 (95% CI, 2.56-24.19) at age 16 to 1.13 (95% CI, 1.01-1.25) at age 77. In the longitudinal analysis, exposure to 5-ASAs or methotrexate was not associated with change in eGFR, whereas azathioprine was associated with a slightly higher eGFR (0.32 mL/min/1.73 m; 95% CI, 0.16-0.48).In a retrospective study of more than 80,000 persons, we found that  is associated with increased risk of CKD, and the hazard ratio is highest among younger patients.

We sought to ascertain safety and efficacy of excisional hemorrhoidectomy in CD.A retrospective review of all adult CD patients undergoing excisional hemorrhoidectomy between January 1, 1995, and January 1, 2019, at 2  referral centers was performed. Data collected included patient demographics, clinical characteristics of CD (anorectal symptoms; prior nonoperative hemorrhoidal therapy; presence of other perianal disease; and activity, duration, and anatomic location of CD), and postoperative complications including bleeding, wound healing, and need for further therapy or surgical intervention after surgery.A total of 36 adult patients with Crohn's disease with symptomatic hemorrhoidal disease were included. The study cohort included 16 males (44%), and median age was 49 (range, 21 to 77) years. Predominant symptoms included pain (n = 16; 44%), prolapse (n = 8; 22%), and bleeding (n = 12; 33%). Sixteen patients (44%) had nonoperative therapy before surgery. Twenty-four patients (67%) had other perianal disease. At the time of hemorrhoidectomy, 9 patients (25%) were exposed to corticosteroids, 8 patients (25%) to immunomodulators, and 9 patients (25%) to biologics. During a median follow-up time of 31.5 (range, 1 to 255) months after hemorrhoidectomy, 4 patients (11%) had complications (1 developed a stricture, 1 developed a perianal abscess/fistula, 1 had a nonhealing wound, and 1 had hemorrhoidal recurrence).Our data suggest that excisional hemorrhoidectomy may be performed safely in CD patients who have failed nonoperative hemorrhoidal therapy without concern for de novo perianal disease or need for proctectomy.Hemorrhoidal disease is common in patients with Crohn's disease.

Descriptive summary statistics was used.In North America, about one-quarter of gastroenterology and radiology participants reported using bowel US for ; over 3-fourths expressed an interest in using US more often. Bowel US was performed more frequently for Crohn's disease. Both groups agreed the main limitation to using bowel US was concern for inter-observer variability and operator-dependent factors; radiologists reported that other modalities are more effective to assess , whereas gastroenterologists reported unfamiliarity with bowel US indications and techniques.Our data show there is significant interest among both radiologists and gastroenterologists in using bowel US.

Clinical consequences such as carrying out abdominal ultrasound, endoscopy, drug modification or FC re-measurement at the next ambulatory presentation or during in-patient stay were collected. Statistical analysis was performed to determine the association between clinical decision-making and patient's characteristics, especially FC value.Overall, 192 (67%) clinical consequences were noted in both cohorts. In the case cohort 174 (91%) implications were noted compared to 18 (9%) in the control cohort (P < 0.001). In the case cohort, significantly more clinical consequences were detected in patients with Crohn's disease (CD) as well as in ulcerative colitis (UC) patients with a FC value > 250 mg/Kg than in patients with a value of ≤ 250 mg/Kg. In CD patients with high FC values significantly increased numbers of abdominal ultrasounds, endoscopies and FC re-measurements were noted.

Here, we report an interventional prospective cohort study performed to elucidate the extent of and processes underlying microbiota engraftment in  patients after FMT treatment. The cohort included two categories of patients: (1) patients with moderate to severe Crohn's disease (CD)（Harvey-Bradshaw Index ≥ 7, n = 11） and (2) patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) (Montreal classification S2 and S3, n = 4). All patients were treated with a single FMT (via mid-gut, from healthy donors) and follow-up visits were performed at baseline, 3 days, one week, and one month after FMT (missing time points included). At each follow-up time point, fecal samples and clinical metadata were collected. For comparative analysis, 10 fecal samples from 10 healthy donors were included to represent the diversity level of normal gut microbiota. Additionally, the metagenomic data of 25 fecal samples from 5 individuals with metabolic syndrome who underwent autologous FMT treatment were downloaded from a previous published paper to represent fluctuations in microbiota induced during FMT. All fecal samples underwent shotgun metagenomic sequencing. We found that 3 days after FMT, 11 out of 15 recipients were in remission (3 out of 4 UC recipients; 8 out of 11 CD recipients). Generally, bacterial colonization was observed to be lower in CD recipients than in UC recipients at both species and strain levels. Furthermore, across species, different strains displayed disease-specific displacement advantages under two-disease status. Finally, most post-FMT species (> 80%) could be properly predicted (AUC > 85%) using a random forest classification model, with the gut microbiota composition and clinical parameters of pre-FMT recipients acting as factors that contribute to prediction accuracy.© 2019 The Authors.

Our previous studies have shown that exposure to GW chemicals resulted in altered microbiome which was associated with damage associated molecular pattern (DAMP) release followed by neuro and gastrointestinal inflammation with loss of gut barrier integrity. Enteric glial cells (EGC) are emerging as important regulators of the gastrointestinal tract and have been observed to change to a reactive phenotype in several functional gastrointestinal disorders such as IBS and . This study is aimed at investigating the role of dysbiosis associated EGC immune-activation and redox instability in contributing to observed gastrointestinal barrier integrity loss in GWI via altered tight junction protein expression. Using a mouse model of GWI and  studies with cultured EGC and use of antibiotics to ensure gut decontamination we show that exposure to GW chemicals caused dysbiosis associated change in EGCs. EGCs changed to a reactive phenotype characterized by activation of TLR4-S100β/RAGE-iNOS pathway causing release of nitric oxide and activation of NOX2 since gut sterility with antibiotics prevented this change. The resulting peroxynitrite generation led to increased oxidative stress that triggered inflammation as shown by increased NLRP-3 inflammasome activation and increased cell death. Activated EGCs  and  were associated with decrease in tight junction protein occludin and selective water channel aquaporin-3 with a concomitant increase in Claudin-2. The tight junction protein levels were restored following a parallel treatment of GWI mice with a TLR4 inhibitor SsnB and butyric acid that are known to decrease the immunoactivation of EGCs. Our study demonstrates that immune-redox mechanisms in EGC are important players in the pathology in GWI and may be possible therapeutic targets for improving outcomes in GWI symptom persistence.Copyright © 2019 Kimono, Sarkar, Albadrani, Seth, Bose, Mondal, Li, Kar, Nagarkatti, Nagarkatti, Sullivan, Janulewicz, Lasley, Horner, Klimas and Chatterjee.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31613652>Marked regional variations in the prevalence of inflammatory bowel disease in a limited geographical region are not associated with compounds in the drinking water.</a></h1><p> The incidence of autoimmune diseases, especially inflammatory bowel disease (), has increased substantially.

Safety outcomes were extracted by medical chart review. For an updated literature review, EMBASE, Medline, and CENTRAL were searched to identify studies evaluating the safety of combination biologic and antirejection therapy in  patients.In the case series, 19 patients were identified. Most underwent LT for primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC; 14/19, 74%) treated with anti-integrins (8/19, 42%) or tumor necrosis factor α (TNF) antagonists (6/19, 32%). Infections occurred in 11/19 (58%) patients, most commonly Clostridium difficile (4/19, 21%). Two patients required colectomy, and 1 patient required re-transplantation. In the literature review, 13 case series and 8 case reports reporting outcomes for 122  patients treated with biologic and antirejection therapy post-LT were included. PSC was the indication for LT in 97/122 (80%) patients, and 91/122 (75%) patients were treated with TNF antagonists. Infections occurred in 32/122 (26%) patients, primarily Clostridium difficile (7/122, 6%).Inflammatory bowel disease patients receiving combination biologic and antirejection therapy post-LT appeared to be at increased risk of Clostridium difficile. Compared with the general liver transplant population in the published literature, there was no increased risk of serious infection.© 2019 Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation.

Articles published in English during January 1998 - June 2018 that compared diagnostic FC testing in primary care and outpatient hospital settings with a reference test and employed the standard enzyme-linked immunosorbent FC assay method with a cut-off of 50 or 100 μg/g faeces were included. Study quality was assessed with QUADAS-2, an evidence-based quality assessment tool for diagnostic accuracy studies.MEDLINE and EMBASE; reference lists of screened articles.Eighteen relevant studies were identified. For distinguishing patients with organic GID (including ) from those with functional GIDs (16 studies), the estimated sensitivity of FC testing was 81% (95% CI, 74-86%), the specificity 81% (95% CI, 71-88%); area under the curve (AUC) was 0.87. For distinguishing  from functional GIDs (ten studies), sensitivity was 88% (95% CI, 80-93%), specificity 72% (95% CI, 59-82%), and AUC 0.89. Assuming a population prevalence of organic GID of 1%, the positive predictive value was 4.2%, the negative predictive value 100%. The difference in sensitivity and specificity between FC testing cut-offs of 50 μg/g and 100 μg/g faeces was not statistically significant (P = 0.77).FC testing is clinically useful for distinguishing organic GID (including ) from functional GIDs, and its incorporation into clinical practice for evaluating patients with lower gastrointestinal symptoms could lead to fewer patients with functional GIDs undergoing colonoscopy, reducing costs for both patients and the health system.CRD4201810507.© 2019 AMPCo Pty Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31625422>Anorectal function and quality of life in  patients with a perianal complaint.</a></h1><p> Anorectal function of inflammatory bowel disease () patients is still poorly understood, with contradictory results. This prospective observational study aimed to analyze the effect of perianal disease on anorectal function and quality of life in  patients.  Patient assessment included full clinical examination, validated scores, anorectal manometry, three-dimensional endoanal ultrasonography, and endoscopy. The Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire was adopted to evaluate patients' quality of life.  From January to November 2016, 37 consecutive  patients (30 Crohn's disease, 7 ulcerative colitis) and 20 controls were enrolled in the study. Twenty-five patients had a history of perianal fistula, 9 reported fecal incontinence, and 2 had anal fissure. Fecal incontinent patients were older, had a longer disease duration, and higher bowel movement number than continent patients. Endoanal ultrasound findings were normal in all volunteers, while pathological features were found in 31/37 patients. Rectal sensory testing and anal pressure did not differ between the  patients and controls. However, the rectoanal inhibitory reflex was normally elicited in all controls vs. 32/37 (86%)  patients; 25/37 (68%)  patients showed manometric features of dyssynergic defecation. Rectal inflammation and incontinence were associated with low maximum anal resting pressure. The quality of life score was lower in ulcerative colitis patients than in Crohn's patients and significantly lower in fecal incontinent patients.  Anorectal function is impaired in  patients with perianal disease. Fecal incontinence correlates with poorer quality of life. Anorectal manometry and ultrasonography are useful tools for evaluating  patients.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31681784>Inflammatory Bowel Disease ()-A Textbook Case for Multi-Centric Banking of Human Biological Materials.</a></h1><p>Inflammatory bowel disease () is a chronic relapsing inflammatory condition affecting mainly the gastro-intestinal tract with two main entities: Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Although the exact mechanisms underlying the initial development of  are not fully understood, it is believed that an abnormal immune response is elicited against the intestinal microbiota in genetically predisposed individuals. Crucial elements of the etiopathogenesis have been elucidated by research using human biological materials. The estimated prevalence of  is 0.5% in the Western world. Although incidence rates are increasing, both conditions are not "common" in general terms mandating a multicentric approach. Biological material from numerous Belgian patients have been collected over time in a number of university hospitals in Belgium (UH Ghent: 800 CD patients, 350 UC patients, 600 normal controls; UH Leuven: 2,600 CD patients, 1,380 UC patients, 98 IC/IBDU patients, 6,260 normal controls). Within the setting of the Flemish Center Medical Innovation (CMI) initiative and later on the Flemish biobank network a prospective study was set-up across three Belgian  centers (University Hospitals Brussels, Ghent, and Leuven). Human biological materials and data have been collected prospectively from newly diagnosed CD and UC patients. The analyses hereof have generated new insights which have been published in the most renowned journals. The approach of well-thought off, multi-centric, structured, and systematic biobanking has proven to be a success-story and thus a textbook case for multi-centric banking of human biological materials.

CD4CD8αα IELs are one of the most important types of IELs, and they play an irreplaceable role in maintaining the balance of the intestinal immune system. CD4CD8αα IELs are often regarded as a special subtype of CD4 IELs that can express CD8αα on their cytomembrane. Hence, CD4CD8αα IELs not only have the ability to modulate the functions of immune cells but also are regarded as cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). Transcription factors, microbes, and dietary factors have a substantial effect on the development of CD4CD8αα IELs, which make them exert immunosuppression and cytotoxicity activities. In addition, there is an intimate relationship between CD4CD8αα IELs and inflammatory bowel disease (), whereas it is still unclear how CD4CD8αα IELs influence . As such, this review will focus on the unparalleled differentiation of CD4CD8αα IELs and discuss how these cells might be devoted to tolerance and immunopathological responses in the intestinal tract. In addition, the role of CD4CD8αα IELs in  would also be discussed.Copyright © 2019 Zhou, Qiu and Yang.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31641205>DSS-induced colitis produces inflammation-induced bone loss while irisin treatment mitigates the inflammatory state in both gut and bone.</a></h1><p>Chronic pediatric inflammatory bowel disease () leads to lack of bone accrual, bone loss, and increased fractures. Presently there is no cure, and many  treatments incur negative side effects. We previously discovered treatment with exogenous irisin resolved inflammatory changes in the colon, gut lymphatics, and bone in a mild  rodent model. Here we assess irisin treatment in severe  induced via dextran sodium sulfate (DSS). Male Sprague Dawley rats (2-mo-old) were untreated (Con) or given 2% DSS in drinking water. In week two, half of each group (Con + Ir and DSS + Ir) received injections of recombinant irisin (i.p., 2x/wk). After 4 weeks, gut inflammation was associated with declines in bone mineral density and cancellous bone volume. Furthermore, elevated osteocyte TNF-α, interleukin-6, RANKL, OPG, and sclerostin corresponded with higher osteoclast surfaces and lower bone formation rate in DSS animals as well as lower ultimate load. While irisin treatment improved colon inflammation, there were no improvements in bone density or bone mechanical properties; however, irisin elevated bone formation rate, decreased osteoclast surfaces, and reduced osteocyte pro-inflammatory factors. These data highlight the negative impact of chronic gut inflammation on bone as well as the therapeutic potential of irisin as an anti-inflammatory treatment.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31614204>Polysaccharides derived from Morinda citrifolia Linn reduce inflammatory markers during experimental colitis.</a></h1><p>There are many reports of pharmacological activities of extracts and fractions of different vegetable-derived products in the scientific literature and in folk medicine. Ethnopharmacological use of these products by various communities continues to be extensively explored, and they account for more than half of all medications used worldwide. Polysaccharides (PLS) extracted from plants such as Morinda Citrifolia Linn present therapeutic potential in treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases () such as ulcerative colitis (UC).To evaluate the anti-inflammatory action of Noni PLS against the intestinal damage in UC induced by acetic acid in mice.In acetic acid-induced colitis, the mice were treated intraperitoneally (ip) with PLS (0.1, 0.3, and 3.0 mg/kg) or subcutaneously (sc) with dexamethasone (2.0 mg/kg) 30 min before euthanasia to determine the best dose of PLS with an anti-inflammatory effect in the course of UC. The colonic tissue samples were collected for macroscopic, wet weight, microscopic and biochemical (myeloperoxidase (MPO), glutathione (GSH), malondialdehyde (MDA), nitrate/nitrite (NO/NO), cytokines, and cyclooxygenase (COX-2)) analyses.Treatment with PLS reduced the intestinal damage induced by acetic acid as it reduced macroscopic and microscopic scores and the wet weight of the colon. In addition, MPO activity and levels of GSH, MDA, NO/NO, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and COX-2 expression reduced.This study suggests that PLS exhibits anti-inflammatory action against intestinal damage by reducing inflammatory cell infiltration, oxidative stress, pro-inflammatory action of cytokines, and COX-2 expression in the inflamed colon. PLS shows therapeutic potential against inflammatory disorders like UC.Copyright © 2019.

Growing evidence suggests that gut microbiota can interfere with chemotherapeutic and immunosuppressant drugs, used in the treatment of these diseases, reducing or facilitating drug efficacy. In particular, the effect of intestinal microflora through translocation, immunomodulation, metabolism, enzymatic degradation and reduction of bacterial diversity seems to be one of the reasons of interindividual variability in the therapeutic response. Although the extent of the role of intestinal microflora in chemotherapy and immunosuppression remains still unresolved, current evidence on bacterial compositional shifts will be taken in consideration together with clinical response to drugs for a better and personalized therapy.

So, we tried our best to investigate the mechanism and signaling pathway of MAST3 in RA progression. In the synovial tissue and FLSs of AA rats, we have found that MAST3 was significantly up-regulated than normal. Furthermore, MAST3 overexpression could promote proliferation and inflammatory response of FLSs.

Some patients have recurrence of flares, or become antibiotic dependent, and require repeated courses or prolonged periods of antibiotic therapy. We investigated microbial factors associated with response to antibiotic treatment and development of antibiotic dependence in patients with pouchitis.We performed a prospective study of 49 patients who had undergone pouch surgery at a tertiary center in Israel. Disease activity was determined based on clinical, endoscopic, and histologic criteria. Pouch phenotype was defined as recurrent acute pouchitis (n=6), chronic pouchitis and Crohn's-like disease of the pouch (n=27), normal pouch from patient with ulcerative colitis (n=10), and normal pouch from patient with familial adenomatous polyposis (n=6). Fecal samples (n=234) were collected over time during or in the absence of antibiotic treatment (ciprofloxacin and/or metronidazole). Thirty-three patients were treated with antibiotics, for a median of 425 days of cumulative antibiotic therapy, during follow up. Calprotectin was measured and fecal DNA was sequenced using shotgun metagenomics and analyzed with specifically designed bioinformatic pipelines. Bacterial strains were isolated from fecal samples. We assessed their ciprofloxacin resistance and ability to induce secretion of inflammatory cytokines by human intestinal epithelial cells HT-29.Most antibiotic-treated patients (79%) had a clinical response to each course of antibiotics. However, 89% of those who completed a 4-weeks course relapsed within 3 months. Median calprotectin levels decreased by 40% in response to antibiotics. Antibiotic treatment reduced disease-associated bacteria such as Clostridium perfringens, Ruminococcus gnavus, and Klebsiella pneumoniae but also beneficial species such as Faecalibacterium prausnitzii. The microbiomes of antibiotic-responsive patients were dominated by facultative anaerobic genera (Escherichia, Enterococcus, and Streptococcus), with multiple ciprofloxacin-resistance mutations in drug target genes and confirmed drug resistance. However, these strains had lower potential for virulence and did not induce secretion of inflammatory cytokines by epithelial cells. After antibiotic cessation, patients had an abrupt shift in microbiome composition, with blooms of oral and disease-associated bacteria. In addition, antibiotic treatment enriched for strains that acquired multidrug resistance loci, encoding enzymes that confer resistance to non-related antibiotics including extended-spectrum beta-lactamases.The efficacy of antibiotic treatment of pouchitis might be attributed to the establishment of antibiotic-resistant microbiome with low inflammatory potential. This microbiome might provide resistance against colonization by bacteria that promote inflammation. To avoid progression to antibiotic-dependent disease and its consequences, strategies such as short-term alternating antibiotics and nutrition- and microbiome-based interventions should be considered.Copyright © 2019 AGA Institute.

Transition probabilities, quality of life, and costs were estimated using real world data. Propensity score matching was used to ensure comparability between patients in the early (intervention) and late/no (comparator) biologic initiation strategies. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained is reported in Swiss francs (CHF). Sensitivity and scenario analyses were performed.Total costs and QALYs were higher for the intervention (CHF384,607; 16.84 QALYs) compared to comparator (CHF340,800; 16.75 QALYs) strategy, resulting in high ICERs (health system: CHF887,450 per QALY; societal: CHF449,130 per QALY). Assuming a threshold of CHF100,000 per QALY, in probabilistic sensitivity analysis the intervention strategy had a 0.1 and 0.25 probability of being cost-effective from the health system and societal perspectives, respectively. In addition, ICERs improved when we assumed a 30% reduction in biologic prices (health system: CHF134,502 per QALY; societal: intervention dominant).Early biologic use was not cost-effective considering a threshold of CHF100,000 per QALY compared to late/no biologic use. However, early identification of patients likely to need biologics and future drug price reductions through increased availability of biosimilars may improve the cost-effectiveness of an early treatment approach.Copyright © 2019 European Crohn’s and Colitis Organisation (ECCO).

TNFi exposure was defined as a prescription for adalimumab, etanercept, infliximab, certolizumab, or golimumab, and the primary outcome was incident psoriasis. IRs and standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) were calculated. Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess the association of psoriasis with TNFi exposure and other risk factors.Of the 4111 children who met inclusion criteria, 1614 (39%) had TNFi exposure and 2497 (61%) did not with 4705 and 6604 person-years of follow-up, respectively. There were 58 (IR 12.3 per 1000 person-years) and 25 (IR 3.8 per 1000 person-years) cases of psoriasis in children with and without TNFi exposure, respectively. The SIR was 18 (95% confidence interval [CI] 15, 22) overall, 30 (95% CI 23, 39) for children with TNFi exposure, and 9.3 (95% CI 6.3, 14) for children without TNFi exposure. The hazard ratio (HR) of psoriasis comparing TNFi exposure to no TNFi exposure was 3.84 (95% CI 2.28, 6.47, p<0.001).Children with , JIA, and CNO had an increased rate of psoriasis compared to the general pediatric population, with the highest rate in those with TNFi exposure.© 2019, American College of Rheumatology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31622979>The ACS National Surgical Quality Improvement Program-Inflammatory Bowel Disease Collaborative: Design, Implementation, and Validation of a Disease-specific Module.</a></h1><p>Surgery for inflammatory bowel disease () involves a complex interplay between disease, surgery, and medications, exposing patients to increased risk of postoperative complications. Surgical best practices have been largely based on single-institution results and meta-analyses, with multicenter clinical data lacking. The American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Project (ACS-NSQIP) has revolutionized the way in which large-volume surgical outcomes data have been collected. Our aim was to employ the ACS-NSQIP to collect disease-specific variables relevant to surgical outcomes in .A collaborative of 13 high-volume  surgery centers was convened to collect 5 -specific variables in NSQIP. Variables included biologic and immunomodulator medications usage, ileostomy utilization, ileal pouch anastomotic technique, and colonic dysplasia/neoplasia. A sample of the Surgical Clinical Reviewer collected data was validated by a colorectal surgeon at each institution, and kappa's agreement statistics generated.Over 1 year, data were collected on a total of 956 cases. Overall, 41.4% of patients had taken a biologic agent in the 60 days before surgery. The 2 most commonly performed procedures were laparoscopic ileocolic resections (159 cases) and subtotal colectomies (151 cases). Overall, 56.8% of cases employed an ileostomy, and 134 ileal pouches were constructed, of which 92.4% used stapled technique. A sample of 214 (22.4%) consecutive cases was validated from 8 institutions. All 5 novel variables were shown to be reliably collected, with excellent agreement for 4 variables (kappa ≥ 0.70) and very good agreement for the presence of colonic dysplasia (kappa = 0.68).We report the results of the initial year of implementation of the first disease-specific collaborative within NSQIP. The selected variables were demonstrated to be reliably collected, and this collaborative will facilitate high-quality, large case-volume research specific to the  patient population.© 2019 Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation.

We investigated the role of LINC01234 in CRC development and confirmed its correlation with Krüppel-like factor 6 (KLF6), a tumor suppressor gene that is dysregulated in CRC.We tested mRNA levels using quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR). Tissue samples from patients with CRC, inflammatory bowel disease (), hyperplastic polyp, and adenoma were included. Correlations between clinicopathological parameters, overall survival (OS) rate, and LINC01234 were analyzed using Kruskal-Wallis H test. Additionally, cell proliferation, apoptosis, and tumor formation in nude mice were tested to investigate the mechanism of LINC01234. Western blotting was used to determine protein levels.LINC01234 expression was significantly upregulated in CRC tissues and CRC cell lines than in non-tumor tissues and normal epithelial cells, respectively. LINC01234 was associated with high tumor stage, larger tumor size, and metastasis. Patients with higher LINC01234 expression showed reduced OS. Cell proliferation was inhibited by LINC01234 knockdown, whereas apoptosis was enhanced. Mice injected with SW480 cells with LINC01234 knockdown displayed decreased tumor volume, weight, and Ki-67 levels compared with those injected with control cells. KLF6 was negatively regulated by LINC01234. Overexpression of KLF6 showed effects similar to those observed following LINC01234 knockdown on cell proliferation and apoptosis.LINC01234 could be a prognostic biomarker in CRC patients. Upregulation of LINC01234 in CRC promotes tumor development through negative regulation of KLF6.© The Korean Society for Laboratory Medicine.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31603356>Microbiota and mucosal defense in : an update.</a></h1><p>: Inflammatory bowel diseases () are on the rise worldwide. This review covers the current concepts of the etiology of Crohn´s disease and ulcerative colitis by focusing on an unbalanced interaction between the intestinal microbiota and the mucosal barrier. Understanding these issues is of paramount importance for the development of targeted therapies aiming at the disease cause.: Gut microbiota alterations and a dysfunctional intestinal mucosa are associated with . Here we focus on specific defense structures of the mucosal barrier, namely antimicrobial peptides and the mucus layer, which keep the gut microbiota at a distance under healthy conditions and are defective in .: The microbiology of both forms of  is different but characterized by a reduced bacterial diversity and richness. Abundance of certain bacterial species is altered, and the compositional changes are related to disease activity. In  the mucus layer above the epithelium is contaminated by bacteria and the immune reaction is dominated by the antibacterial response. Human genetics suggest that many of the basic deficiencies in the mucosal response, due to Paneth cell, defensin and mucus defects, are primary.

However, significant challenges still exist in Latin America to facilitate the access of biological agents for physicians and patients.The aim of this review was to summarize current evidence on penetration of biological agents for CD and UC in Latin America.Data are derived from a previous complete systematic review that explored different characteristics of inflammatory bowel diseases () in Latin America. The studies fully included in this previous systematic review which contained detailed descriptions of the percentage of use of biological agents in different cohorts throughout Latin American and Caribbean countries were included, and descriptive findings were compiled, describing CD and UC penetration of these drugs in different patient cohorts from different countries.From the 61 studies included in the original systematic review, only 19 included data of the percentage of patients treated with biological agents. Anti-TNF use in CD varied from 1.51% in Mexico up to 46.9% in Colombia, with most of the studies describing anti-TNF use in approximately 20%-40% of CD patients. On the other side, the frequency of the use of biologics was clearly lower in UC, varying from 0% in 2009 to up 16.2% in 2018, according to two different Mexican studies. Only two studies described the penetration of anti-TNF agents in  overall: 13.4% in a Colombian and 37.93% in a Brazilian study. No studies described percentage of use of new biologic agents (vedolizumab and ustekinumab).Penetration of anti-TNF agents in Latin America is comparable to the rest of the world in CD, but lower in UC.

Data were analysed in induction, maintenance and overall (patients receiving ≥ 1 dose of tofacitinib 5 or 10 mg b.d. in any phase 2, 3 or OLE study) cohorts.1157 patients (2404 patient-years' exposure; ≤ 6.1 years' tofacitinib treatment) were evaluated in the overall cohort. In induction, one placebo-treated patient had DVT and one had PE; no tofacitinib-treated patients had DVT/PE. In maintenance, one placebo-treated patient had DVT and one had PE; no tofacitinib-treated patients had DVT/PE. In the overall cohort, one patient had DVT (incidence rate [patients with events/100 patient-years; 95% CI]: 0.04 [0.00-0.23]); four had PE (0.16 [0.04-0.41]); all received predominant dose tofacitinib 10 mg b.d.; all had venous thromboembolism risk factors alongside UC.In this post hoc analysis of patients with UC, during tofacitinib exposure, one patient had DVT and four had PE, all during the OLE study, on predominant dose 10 mg b.d.

In all cases of perianal CD, medical and surgical treatments should be used in tandem by a multidisciplinary team. Significant development has been made in the treatment of Crohn's-related fistulas, particularly minimally invasive options with recent clinical trials showing success with mesenchymal stem cell applications. Inevitably, some patients with severe refractory disease may require fecal diversion or proctectomy.

While the core machinery is known, the molecular basis of the epigenetic regulation of autophagy and its role in colon inflammation remain largely undefined. Here, we report that BRG1, an ATPase subunit of the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, is required for the homeostatic maintenance of intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) to prevent the inflammation and tumorigenesis. BRG1 emerges as a key regulator that directly governs the transcription of Atg16l1, Ambra1, Atg7 and Wipi2, which are important for autophagosome biogenesis. Defective autophagy in BRG1-deficient IECs results in excess reactive oxygen species (ROS), which leads to the defects in barrier integrity. Together, our results establish that BRG1 may represent an autophagy checkpoint that is pathogenetically linked to colitis and is therefore likely a potential therapeutic target for disease intervention.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31631055>Skeletal status assessed by quantitative ultrasound and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry in children with inflammatory bowel disease: A 2-year prospective study.</a></h1><p>To assess the bone status in children with inflammatory bowel diseases () using quantitative ultrasound (QUS) measurement and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) at baseline and after two years of adequate treatment of the  and bone protection medication.Sixteen children (six boys) with , aged 13.4±2.4 years, were examined at baseline and two years later.

QUS measurements were performed in patients and controls - 48 healthy children.Mean Z-scores for TB- and s-BMD were significantly below zero for both, baseline and follow-up (-2.61±0.99 and -2.48±0.88 for TB, and -1.83±1.33 and -1.61±1.19 for s-BMD, respectively), and did not differ significantly, as well as mean Ad-SoS Z-score. The changes in time of TB Z-score and body weight Z-score correlated positively (r=0.63; P<0.01). The QUS results did not differ between patients and controls. There was a negative correlation between the baseline nutritional status and the activity of the disease, as well as of the number of flares before the enrolment and Ad-SoS Z-score.BMD was found to be lowered both at baseline and follow-up. No further deterioration was observed during 2-year follow-up. Proper treatment, defined as treatment following ECCO Guidelines, may allow to keep a similar trend in the development of bone tissue as in healthy children. The bone properties assessed by QUS method did not differ between patients and controls.

Patchouli alcohol (PA) has anti-inflammatory effects; however, the effect of PA on  pathogenesis remains largely unknown.The aim of the present study was to investigate the anti-inflammatory effect of PA, primarily focused on crosstalk between PA-mediated PXR activation and NF-κB inhibition.We evaluated the anti-inflammatory effect of PA with respect to PXR/NF-κB signalling using in vitro and in vivo models. In vitro, PA, identified as a PXR agonist, was evaluated by hPXR transactivation assays and through assessing for CYP3A4 expression and activity. NF-κB inhibition was analysed based on NF-κB luciferase assays, NF-κB-mediated pro-inflammatory gene expression, and NF-κB nuclear translocation after activation of PXR by PA. In vivo, colonic mPXR and NF-κB signalling were analysed to assess PA-mediated the protective effect against dextran sulphate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of PXR was further evaluated by examining PA protection against DSS-induced colitis.PA induced CYP3A4 expression and activity via an hPXR-dependent mechanism. PA-mediated PXR activation attenuated inflammation by inhibiting NF-κB activity and nuclear translocation. The anti-inflammatory effect of PA on NF-κB was abolished by PXR knockdown. PA prevented DSS-induced inflammation by regulating PXR/NF-κB signalling, whereas pharmacological PXR inhibition abated PA-mediated suppressive effects on NF-κB inflammation signalling.PA activates PXR signalling and suppresses NF-κB signalling, consequently causing amelioration of inflammation. Our results highlight the importance of PXR-NF-κB crosstalk in colitis and suggest a novel therapeutic reagent.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

However, its effect on the development of inflammatory bowel disease () and the underlying mechanism have not been clarified. This study aimed to assess the clinical value of ERβCD4 T cells in  patients and examine the anti-inflammatory role of ERβ activation in dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced chronic colitis in mice. We investigated the effects of ERB041 (an ERβ-specific agonist) on inflammatory cytokines and pro-inflammatory T-cell and regulatory T-cell (Treg) responses in murine colitis. We tested the role of ERβ activation on Treg differentiation and its activity to suppress T-cell proliferation in vitro. We found that reduced frequency of circulating ERβCD4 T cells in  patients was negatively correlated with inflammation and disease severity. ERβ and FoxP3 expression co-localized in the intestinal tissues of  patients. Treatment with ERB041 significantly mitigated colitis-induced weight loss, inflammation, and disease severity. It also restored the ERβCD4 T cell population in the spleen and colon lamina propria of these mice. ERB041 treatment inhibited CD4CD25 and CD8 T cell infiltration and restored Tregs and activated T-cell immunoreceptor with Ig and ITIM domains (TIGIT) Tregs in the colon lamina propria. In vitro, we found that ERβ activation enhanced Treg differentiation, immunosuppression, and TGF-β1/Smad signaling in CD4 T cells. Our data suggest that ERβCD4 T cells represent a potential biomarker for evaluating  disease severity, and ERβ activation may be valuable for the treatment of  by enhancing the Treg response.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

We report the prevalence, mortality, and overall burden of  in 195 countries and territories between 1990 and 2017, based on data from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2017.We modelled mortality due to  using a standard Cause of Death Ensemble model including data mainly from vital registrations. To estimate the non-fatal burden, we used data presented in primary studies, hospital discharges, and claims data, and used DisMod-MR 2.1, a Bayesian meta-regression tool, to ensure consistency between measures. Mortality, prevalence, years of life lost (YLLs) due to premature death, years lived with disability (YLDs), and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) were estimated.

Inferring potential related microbes for diseases can not only promote disease prevention, diagnosis and treatment, but also provide valuable information for drug development. Considering that experimental methods are expensive and time-consuming, developing computational methods is an alternative choice. However, most of existing methods are biased towards well-characterized diseases and microbes. Furthermore, existing computational methods are limited in predicting potential microbes for new diseases.Here, we developed a novel computational model to predict potential human microbe-disease associations (MDAs) based on Weighted Meta-Graph (WMGHMDA). We first constructed a heterogeneous information network (HIN) by combining the integrated microbe similarity network, the integrated disease similarity network and the known microbe-disease bipartite network. And then, we implemented iteratively pre-designed Weighted Meta-Graph search algorithm on the HIN to uncover possible microbe-disease pairs by cumulating the contribution values of weighted meta-graphs to the pairs as their probability scores. Depending on contribution potential, we described the contribution degree of different types of meta-graphs to a microbe-disease pair with bias rating. Meta-graph with higher bias rating will be assigned greater weight value when calculating probability scores.The experimental results showed that WMGHMDA outperformed some state-of-the-art methods with average AUCs of 0.9288, 0.9068 ±0.0031 in global leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV) and 5-fold cross validation (5-fold CV), respectively. In the case studies, 9, 19, 37 and 10, 20, 45 out of top-10, 20, 50 candidate microbes were manually verified by previous reports for asthma and inflammatory bowel disease (), respectively. Furthermore, three common human diseases (Crohn's disease, Liver cirrhosis, Type 1 diabetes) were adopted to demonstrate that WMGHMDA could be efficiently applied to make predictions for new diseases. In summary, WMGHMDA has a high potential in predicting microbe-disease associations.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31599799>Venous involvement in inflammatory disorders.</a></h1><p>To review the association of venous thrombosis and inflammatory disorders.Various systemic inflammatory diseases of which Behçet's syndrome is the prototype are associated with an increased risk of venous thrombosis. Recent data indicate that venous wall thickness is increased among Behçet's syndrome patients with no history of venous thrombosis and thrombosis in Behçet's syndrome could be a unique model of inflammation-induced thrombosis. Patients with inflammatory bowel disease () have a two to three time-fold increased risk of developing thromboembolic complications compared with general population. The risk of venous thrombosis is increased after surgical interventions and is higher in ulcerative colitis compared with Crohn's disease. Despite similarities with Behçet's syndrome, anticoagulation is advised as the main treatment in , while there is uncertainty about the duration of antithrombotic prophylaxis. Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitides and ankylosing spondylitis are also other inflammatory disorders associated with a thrombotic risk.Underlying mechanisms of venous thrombosis in inflammatory disorders are not clearly understood. How we might prevent thrombosis, should we screen asymptomatic patients, what should we use for the treatment (immunosuppression or anticoagulation or both) and what should be the duration of this treatment also need to be addressed. Finally, the link between inflammation and thrombosis should be more intensively studied.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31632367>Macrophage Migration Inhibitory Factor Triggers Inflammatory Responses During Very Virulent Infectious Bursal Disease Virus Infection.</a></h1><p>Infectious bursal disease () is one of the main threats to the poultry industry worldwide. In China, very virulent  virus (vvIBDV) is the main prevalent virus strain, causing inflammation, immunosuppression, and high mortality in young chickens. To determine whether this acute inflammation can trigger lesions or even death in chickens, it is important to study the mechanism of vvIBDV pathogenicity. Thus, in the current study, we investigated the inflammation response, bursal lesions, and mortality in chickens caused by vvIBDV at different time points postinfection. Results showed an upregulation of proinflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-1β and interleukin-18, and macrophage infiltration in bursa in response to vvIBDV infection. High-throughput proteomic sequencing based on isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation showed that chicken macrophage migration inhibitory factor (chMIF) was upregulated uniquely in primary bursal cells infected with vvIBDV compared with infection by nonpathogenic attenuated IBDV. We confirmed that chMIF was upregulated by vvIBDV infection both  and . Moreover, chMIF was extracellularly secreted by infected DT40 and primary bursal cells. Further experiments revealed that the secreted chMIF could induce migration of peripheral blood mononuclear cells and promote transcription of proinflammatory cytokines in chicken primary macrophages. Notably, these effects of chMIF could be reduced by using an MIF specific inhibitor. Thus, our study elucidates critical molecular determinants underlying vvIBDV-mediated initiation of acute inflammation, which might be pivotal to understand the mechanism of vvIBDV pathogenicity.Copyright © 2019 Liu, Li, Qi, Wang, Yang, Wu, Yan, Li, Pan, Gao, Gao, Liu, Zhang, Cui, Li, Wang and Wang.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31632373>Administration of  Ameliorates Dextran Sulfate Sodium-Induced Ulcerative Colitis in Mice.</a></h1><p>Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) develop as a result of complex interactions among genes, innate immunity and environmental factors, which are related to the gut microbiota. Multiple clinical and animal data have shown that  is associated with a healthy mucosa. However, its precise role in colitis is currently unknown. Our study aimed to determine its protective effects and underlying mechanisms in a dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis mouse model. Twenty-four C57BL/6 male mice were administered  Muc or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) once daily by oral gavage for 14 days. Colitis was induced by drinking 2% DSS from days 0 to 6, followed by 2 days of drinking normal water. Mice were weighed daily and then sacrificed on day 8. We found that  improved DSS-induced colitis, which was evidenced by reduced weight loss, colon length shortening and histopathology scores and enhanced barrier function. Serum and tissue levels of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (TNF-α, IL1α, IL6, IL12A, MIP-1A, G-CSF, and KC) decreased as a result of  administration. Analysis of 16S rDNA sequences showed that  induced significant gut microbiota alterations. Furthermore, correlation analysis indicated that pro-inflammatory cytokines and other injury factors were negatively associated with , , and , which were prominently abundant in -treated mice. We confirmed that  treatment could ameliorate mucosal inflammation either via microbe-host interactions, which protect the gut barrier function and reduce the levels of inflammatory cytokines, or by improving the microbial community.

We propose to compare technical characteristics and results of three different assays on a cohort of 35 patients under infliximab (IFX) and suffering from inflammatory bowel disease ().s-IFXt and ADAb were systematically measured with three ELISA kits: Lisa-Tracker® Duo infliximab (Theradiag®), Ridascreen® IFX Monitoring (R-Biopharm AG®) and Promonitor® IFX (Progenika Biopharma SA®).The main technical features that differed between kits for measuring s-IFXt were: (i) TNF coating, (ii) immune complexes revelation strategy and/or (iii) interference with other anti-TNFα agents. For kits measuring ADAb, they were revelation steps and unit of results. There was an excellent mathematical correlation of s-IFXt between assays however Bland-Altman analysis denoted (i) s-IFXt were on average 48 to 69% higher in Ridascreen® than in the other two assays, and (ii) elevated s-IFXt were higher with Promonitor® compared to Lisa-Tracker®. As a consequence, there were some substantial discrepancies between assays for classification of s-IFXt into concentration ranges. Despite unstandardized units, pairwise qualitative comparison showed a perfect agreement between the three pairs of ADAb assays.Our data show that the evaluated assays are not quantitatively interchangeable due to substantial variations in some results that could lead, for some patients, to divergent therapeutic decisions. We remind to be cautious when comparing study results issued from different kits and recommend using the same assay for the longitudinal follow-up of  patients.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Observation started with the date of the first prescription of index tumor necrosis factor α-inhibitors (anti-TNFα) or vedolizumab (VDZ) therapy and lasted 12 months. Non-persistence was assumed in case of a switch to another biologic or a treatment gap of >90 days.We included 1,248  biologic treatment starters (502 adalimumab, 77 golimumab, 441 infliximab, 228 VDZ); 837/411 were biologic-naïve (bio-naïve)/ biologic-experienced (bio-experienced). Mean age of bio-naïve/bio-experienced anti-TNFα patients was 39.2/38.1 years (54.9%/56.7% female) and 42.6/37.8 years for VDZ patients (56.3%/54.9% female). Seven hundred and seventy-two patients (61.9%) were persistent with their index biologic therapy after 12 months (61.9%/61.8% bio-naïve/bio-experienced). Percentage of persistent patients was 69.7% for VDZ (65.6%/71.3%) and 60.1% for anti-TNFα (61.4%/55.5%).

Mice with  induced by dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) in drinking water exhibit depressive-like behavior. The presence of Lactobacillus in the gut microbiota is associated with major depressive disorder. Therefore, we examined whether Enterococcus faecalis 2001 (EF-2001), a biogenic lactic acid bacterium, prevents DSS-induced depressive-like behavior and changes in peripheral symptoms.We evaluated colon inflammation and used the tail suspension test to examine whether EF-2001 prevents -like symptoms and depressive-like behavior in DSS-treated mice. The protein expression of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP), and cleaved caspase-3 in the rectum and hippocampus was assessed by western blotting. Hippocampal neurogenesis, altered nuclear factor-kappa B (NFκB) p65 morphometry, and the localization of activated NFκB p65 and XIAP were examined by immunohistochemistry.Treatment with 1.5% DSS for 7 days induced -like pathology and depressive-like behavior, increased TNF-α and IL-6 expression in the rectum and hippocampus, activated caspase-3 in the hippocampus, and decreased hippocampal neurogenesis. Interestingly, these changes were reversed by 20-day administration of EF-2001. Further, EF-2001 administration enhanced NFκB p65 expression in the microglial cells and XIAP expression in the hippocampus of DSS-treated mice.EF-2001 prevented -like pathology and depressive-like behavior via decreased rectal and hippocampal inflammatory cytokines and facilitated the NFκB p65/XIAP pathway in the hippocampus.

In particular, an antigenically modified isolate of very virulent IBDV (vvIBDV) called 99323 was detected in Egypt nearly twenty years ago; this isolate was shown to be experimentally controlled by an antigenically classical live vaccine. However, acute  is still reported, even in vaccinated flocks, and little is known about the genetic and antigenic properties of viruses currently circulating in Egypt. In the present study, ten samples collected in Egyptian broiler farms in 2015 as well as five samples collected in 2001 were analyzed. Genetic analyses of partial VP2 sequences revealed that 8 isolates clustered with vvIBDV strains, and 5 with tissue culture adapted and vaccine strains. Similar results were observed for partial VP1 sequences with the exception of isolate 160019, for which VP2 clustered with the vaccine strain Bursine while VP1 clustered with vvIBDV, suggesting reassortment. For isolates genetically related to vvIBDV, antigenic profiling revealed two patterns: while some isolates exhibited typical European vvIBDV reactivity with lack of binding of mAbs 5, other revealed extensive antigenic modifications, with lack of binding of mAbs 3, 5, 6, 8 and 9, similar to isolate 99323. These different patterns were associated with a single amino acid mutation at position 321 of VP2 that is located within peak P. Full genome sequencing was performed for three isolates, among which two were representative of the two antigenic patterns observed for vvIBDV as well as the reassortant isolate 160019. This study highlights the co-circulation of both antigenically typical and modified vvIBDV during the last fifteen years in Egypt.Copyright © 2018.

The present study aimed to investigate the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetic profile of infliximab (IFX) in pediatric patients with moderate-to-severe UC and inadequate response to existing treatment.This open-label, uncontrolled, multicenter, Phase 3 trial was conducted at 17 centers in Japan between April 2012 and September 2014. Pediatric patients (aged 6-17 years) diagnosed with moderate-to-severe UC received a treatment protocol comprising 5 mg/kg IFX at Weeks 0, 2, and 6, and Clinical Activity Index (CAI)-based responders at Week 8 also received treatment at 8-week intervals at Weeks 14 and 22, with a final evaluation at Week 30.A total of 21 patients were treated in this study. IFX therapy rapidly improved clinical symptoms, and this effect was maintained for up to 30 weeks. Overall CAI-based remission rate was 42.9% and overall Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index (PUCAI)-based remission rate was 19.0%.

Thus, a comprehensive understanding of the consequences of blocking IL-6 is imperative. We investigated these consequences by evaluating the effects of IL-6 deletion on the spontaneous colitis of IL-10 deficient mice (IL-10-/-).IL-6/IL-10 double-deficient mice (IL-6-/-/IL-10-/-) were generated and analyzed for intestinal inflammation, general phenotypes, and molecular/biochemical changes in the colonic mucosa by comparing to those of WT and IL-10-/- mice.Unexpectedly, the IL-6-/-/IL-10-/- mice manifested more pronounced gut inflammation and earlier disease onset than IL-10-/- mice, both locally (colon and small bowel) and systemically (splenomegaly, ulcerative dermatitis, leukocytosis, neutrophilia, and monocytosis). IL-6-/-/IL-10-/- mice exhibited elevations of multiple cytokines (IL-1β, IL-4, IL-12, TNFα) and chemokines (MCP-1 and MIG), but not IFN-γ (Th1), IL-17A and IL-17G (Th17), or IL-22 (Th22). FOXP3 and TGF-β, two key factors for Regulatory T (Treg) cell differentiation, were significantly down-regulated in the colonic mucosa, but not in the thymus or mesenteric lymph nodes, of IL-6-/-/IL-10-/- mice. CTLA-4 was diminished while iNOS was upregulated in the colonic mucosa of IL-6-/-/IL-10-/- mice.In IL-10-/- mice, complete IL-6 blockade significantly aggravates gut inflammation, at least in part by suppressing Treg/CTLA-4 and promoting the IL-1β/Th2 pathway. In addition, the double mutant exhibits signs of severe systemic inflammation. Our data define a new function of IL-6 and suggest that caution should be exercised when targeting IL-6 in  patients, particularly those with defects in IL-10 signaling.Copyright © 2019 European Crohn’s and Colitis Organisation (ECCO).

Here, we investigated how chronic nuclear factor (NF)- κB activation, which occurs in human , promotes TNF-dependent IEC death in mice.Human  specimens were stained for p65 and cleaved caspase-3. C57BL/6 mice with constitutively active IKKβ in IEC (Ikkβ(EE)), Ripk1 knockin mice, and Ripk3 mice were injected with TNF or lipopolysaccharide. Enteroids were also isolated from these mice and challenged with TNF with or without RIPK1 and RIPK3 inhibitors or butylated hydroxyanisole. Ripoptosome-mediated caspase-8 activation was assessed by immunoprecipitation.NF-κB activation in human  correlated with appearance of cleaved caspase-3. Congruently, unlike normal mouse IECs that are TNF-resistant, IECs in Ikkβ(EE) mice and enteroids were susceptible to TNF-dependent apoptosis, which depended on the protein kinase function of RIPK1. Constitutively active IKKβ facilitated ripoptosome formation, a RIPK1 signaling complex that mediates caspase-8 activation by TNF. Butylated hydroxyanisole treatment and RIPK1 inhibitors attenuated TNF-induced and ripoptosome-mediated caspase-8 activation and IEC death in vitro and in vivo.Contrary to common expectations, chronic NF-κB activation induced intestinal crypt apoptosis after TNF stimulation, resulting in severe mucosal erosion. RIPK1 kinase inhibitors selectively inhibited TNF destructive properties while preserving its survival and proliferative properties, which do not require RIPK1 kinase activity.
