The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of diets supplemented with cooked red lentils on the colonic microenvironment (microbiota composition and activity and epithelial barrier integrity and function). C57Bl/6 male mice were fed one of five diets: a control basal diet (BD), a BD-supplemented diet with 5, 10 or 20% cooked red lentils (by weight), or a BD-supplemented diet with 0.7% pectin (equivalent soluble fiber level as found in the 20% lentil diet). Red lentil supplementation resulted in increased: (1) fecal microbiota α-diversity; (2) abundance of short-chain  acid ()-producing bacteria (e.g.,  and ); (3) concentrations of fecal SCFAs; (4) mRNA expression of  receptors (G-protein-coupled receptors () and tight/adherens junction proteins (Zona Occulden-1 (), Claudin-2, E-cadherin). Overall, 20% lentil had the greatest impact on colon health outcomes, which were in part explained by a change in the soluble and insoluble fiber profile of the diet. These results support recent public health recommendations to increase consumption of plant-based protein foods for improved health, in particular intestinal health.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31511468>Effect of Storage Condition on Oil Oxidation of Flat-European Hybrid Hazelnut.</a></h2><p>In order to study the oxidative stability of hazelnut oil stored at room temperature, hazelnut oil accelerated oxidized at 62°C was used to determine peroxide value (POV), p-anisidine value (p-AV), total oxidation value (TOTOX), the content of   and  oxidative products. The correlation between the content of   or  oxidative products and three peroxidation indexes was analyzed. The results showed that the relative content of linoleic acid in hazelnut oil decreased significantly at the duration of accelerated oxidation (p < 0.05), which was in line with the zero-order oxidation kinetics model. The absolute content of four   all accorded with the zero-order oxidation kinetics model. Both relative and absolute content of linoleic acid can set up a slightly negative linear correlation with POV, p-AV and TOTOX, respectively (p < 0.05). The oxidation of unsaturated   in hazelnut oil produced a variety of  oxidation products, among which hexanal, 2-octenal, 2-decenal and 3-octene-2-one could establish a significantly positive correlation with POV, p-AV and TOTOX at a certain period of time, which could be used as a new index to evaluate the oxidative decomposition of unsaturated   in hazelnut oil during storage.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31649644>Caecal Microbiota of Experimentally Infected Chickens at Different Ages.</a></h2><p> is the most common bacterial cause of foodborne zoonosis in the European Union. Infections are often linked to the consumption and handling of poultry meat. The aim of the present study was to investigate the caecal microbiota of birds infected with  at different ages. Therefore, a total of 180 birds of the laying hybrid Lohmann Brown-Classic were housed in 12 subgroups of 15 animals each in three performed repetitions. Three birds per subgroup were experimentally infected with  at an age of about 21 days and about 78 days (4.46 ± 0.35 log CFU/bird). Twenty-one days after experimental infection, microbiome studies were performed on 72 caecal samples of dissected birds (three primary infected and three further birds/subgroup). Amplification within the hypervariable region V 4 of the 16S rRNA gene was performed and sequenced with the Illumina MiSeq platform. Statistical analyses were performed using SAS Enterprise Guide (version 7.1) and R (version 3.5.2). Both factors, the experimental replication ( < 0.001) and the chickens' age at infection ( < 0.001) contributed significantly to the differences in microbial composition of the caecal samples. The factor experimental replication explained 24% of the sample's variability, whereas the factor age at infection explained 14% thereof. Twelve of 32 families showed a significantly different count profile between the two age groups, whereby strongest differences were seen for seven families, among them the family  (adjusted  = 0.003). The strongest difference between age groups was seen for a bacterial species that is assigned to the genus  which in turn belongs to the family  (adjusted  < 0.0001). Correlation analyses revealed a common relationship in both chicken ages at infection between the absolute abundance of  and , which consists of the genus  In general, concentrations of particular  (VFA) demonstrated a negative correlation to absolute abundance of , whereby the strongest link was seen for n-butyrate (-0.51141;  < 0.0001). Despite performing consecutive repetitions, the factor experimental replication contributed more to the differences of microbial composition in comparison to the factor age at infection.Copyright © 2019 Hankel, Jung, Kuder, Keller, Keller, Galvez, Strowig and Visscher.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31463982>Dynamic role of single-celled fungi in ruminal microbial ecology and activities.</a></h2><p>In ruminants, high fermentation capacity is necessary to develop more efficient ruminant production systems. Greater level of production depends on the ability of the microbial ecosystem to convert organic matter into precursors of milk and meat. This has led to increased interest by animal nutritionists, biochemists and microbiologists in evaluating different strategies to manipulate the rumen biota to improve animal performance, production efficiency and animal health. One of such strategies is the use of natural feed additives such as single-celled fungi yeast. The main objectives of using yeasts as natural additives in ruminant diets include; (i) to prevent rumen microflora disorders, (ii) to improve and sustain higher production of milk and meat, (iii) to reduce rumen acidosis and bloat which adversely affect animal health and performance, (iv) to decrease the risk of ruminant-associated human pathogens and (v) to reduce the excretion of nitrogenous-based compounds, carbon dioxide and methane. Yeast, a natural feed additive, has the potential to enhance feed degradation by increasing the concentration of  during fermentation processes. In addition, microbial growth in the rumen is enhanced in the presence of yeast leading to the delivery of a greater amount of microbial protein to the duodenum and high nitrogen retention. Single-celled fungi yeast has demonstrated its ability to increase fibre digestibility and lower faecal output of organic matter due to improved digestion of organic matter, which subsequently improves animal productivity. Yeast also has the ability to alter the fermentation process in the rumen in a way that reduces methane formation. Furthermore, yeast inclusion in ruminant diets has been reported to decrease toxins absorption such as mycotoxins and promote epithelial cell integrity. This review article provides information on the impact of single-celled fungi yeast as a feed supplement on ruminal microbiota and its function to improve the health and productive longevity of ruminants.© 2019 The Society for Applied Microbiology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31650328>Successful elevation of circulating acetate and propionate by dietary modulation does not alter T-regulatory cell or cytokine profiles in healthy humans: a pilot study.</a></h2><p>Increased circulating concentrations of short-chain   () achieved by ingestion of high-fibre diets is associated with anti-inflammatory effects through promotion of FoxP3+ regulatory T(reg) cells in mouse models. This study aimed to determine whether similar increments in blood  levels can be achieved in humans and whether these are associated with similar immune modulatory effects.In a pilot single-blinded, randomised, controlled cross-over study in ten healthy subjects, the effects were determined of high- (39 g/day) and low-fibre (18 g/day) intake (all food provided) on  (gas chromatography), proportions of Treg cells (flow cytometry) and a panel of cytokines (multiplex methodology) measured in peripheral blood at day 5 of each diet.Actual fibre intake differed between the diets by 19 [16-21] g/day (P< 0.001). Median [range] total plasma  levels with high-fibre intake were 174.5 [104.8-249.5] µmol/L, which were greater than those associated with low-fibre intake at 59.0 [26.5-79.9] (P < 0.001). Differences were significantly different for both acetate and propionate. The frequencies of total CD4 T cells and T-regulatory cells, and concentrations of inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines were not significantly different between the dietary interventions.Plasma  levels can be modulated by altering dietary fibre consumption in healthy individuals with increments similar to those achieved in murine studies. Five days of diet intervention did not result in changes in regulatory T-cell proportions and cytokine concentrations in peripheral blood, and may require longer duration of dietary change.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31554647>Changes in the gut microbiota during and after commercial helium-oxygen saturation diving in China.</a></h2><p>The influence of commercial helium-oxygen saturation diving on divers' gut microbiotas was assessed to provide dietary suggestion.Faecal samples of 47 divers working offshore were collected before (T1), during (T2) and after (T3) saturation diving. Their living and excursion depths were 55-134 metres underwater with a saturation duration of 12-31 days and PaO of 38-65 kPa. The faecal samples were examined through 16S ribosomal DNA amplicon sequencing based on the Illumina sequencing platform to analyse changes in the bacteria composition in the divers' guts.Although the α and β diversity of the gut microbiota did not change significantly, we found that living in a hyperbaric environment of helium-oxygen saturation decreased the abundance of the genus , an obligate anaerobe, from 2.43%±3.83% at T1 to 0.79%±1.23% at T2 and 0.59%±0.79% at T3. Additionally, the abundance of some short-chain  acid ()-producing bacteria, such as , rectale group and , showed a decreased trend in the order of before, during and after diving. On the contrary, the abundance of species, such as , , , , ,  and , showed an increasing trend, but most of them were pathogens.Occupational exposure to high pressure in a helium-oxygen saturation environment decreased the abundance of  and some -producing bacteria, and increased the risk of pathogenic bacterial infection. Supplementation of the diver diet with probiotics or prebiotics during saturation diving might prevent these undesirable changes.© Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019. No commercial re-use.

The effects of different pH (5.5, 6.5, and uncontrolled) on the VFAs concentration, composition, acidogenic efficiency and microbial community distribution were investigated. The results showed that the highest concentration of VFAs was 267.8 ± 8.9 mg COD/g VS at pH of 6.5, and the highest percentage of butyric acid (79.8%) was followed by propionic acid and acetic acid at the end of the reaction. Microbial analysis showed that the contents of Vagococcus and Actinomyces increased, while the contents of Bacteroides and Fermentimonas decreased during anaerobic fermentation. The comparative high pH induced the accumulation of butyric acid.

Two-phase anaerobic digestion was proposed in this study. Acidogenic fermentation was carried out with corn straw hydrolysate as feedstock for  (VFAs) production. Using anaerobic sludge (AnS), different inoculum to substrate ratios (ISRs) of 0.5:1, 1:1 and 2:1 were investigated. The highest VFAs yield was obtained at ISR of 0.5:1.VFAs composition analysis showed that butyric acid was the predominant acid, followed by acetic acid and propionic acid. The effects of AnS and aerobic sludge (AeS) on the acidogenic performance of hydrolysate were compared. The optimum VFA yields were 0.38 g/g COD-added for AnS and 0.32 g/g COD-added for AeS with HRT of 5 d, respectively. The bacterial diversities of inocula and digestates were analyzed by high-throughput sequencing. Two origins of inocula had distinct bacterial structures, but they did share core communities that included Firmicutes, Chloroflexi, Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes at phylum level. The bacterial communities of both digestates changed significantly as compared with those in inoculum. Firmicutes was absolutely dominant in all the bacterial species. Therefore, the AeS could be an option as the acidogenic inoculum. The microbial information will be beneficial for the enrichment and acclimatization of microbes. In methanogenic process, VFAs obtained in acidogenic stage could be efficiently converted into methane. The ultimate methane yield at organic loading rate (OLR) of 8 g/L·d could reach 290 mL CH/g COD-added and 279 mL CH/g COD-added for AnS and AeS acidified digestate. Two-phase anaerobic digestion was proved to be suitable for bioconversion of lignocellulosic hydrolysate into biogas.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

However, the effects of genistein supplementation in early life on metabolic health in later life are largely unclear. Our objective was to investigate whether maternal genistein intake could mitigate the deleterious influence of a maternal high-fat diet on glucose and lipid metabolism in offspring and to explore the role of gut microbiota in mediating the transgenerational effects. C57BL/6 female mice were fed either a high-fat diet (HF), high-fat diet with genistein (0.6 /kg diet) (HFG) or normal control diet (C) for 3 weeks before pregnancy and throughout pregnancy and lactation. The male offspring had  access to normal chow diet from weaning to 24 weeks of age. Then the content of inguinal subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) and epididymal visceral adipose tissue (VAT) were weighed. Glucose tolerance test (GTT), the level of serum insulin and lipid profiles were analyzed. The caecal contents were collected for 16S rDNA sequencing. The results showed that maternal genistein intake could significantly reduce blood glucose levels during GTT, fasting insulin levels, VAT mass and serum triglyceride levels as well as increase high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in adult male offspring. Significant decrease of germs from the Tenericutes phylum and enrichment of  as well as  (short-chain  acid)-producing bacteria, including , and , in offspring of genistein fed dams might play crucial roles in the improvement of glucose and lipid metabolism. Overall, early-life genistein intake attenuated the harmful effects of maternal HF on metabolism in adult offspring and the protective effects were associated with the alterations in gut microbiota, which provides new evidence and targets for mitigate the poor effects of adverse early-life exposures on metabolic health in later life.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31588658>Glucorticoid-induced obesity individuals have distinct signatures of the gut microbiome.</a></h2><p>The human intestine and its resident microbiota are known to play an essential role in the pathogenesis of primary obesity. However, a little is known of the gut microbiota profiles in individuals with obesity induced by glucocorticoid (GC) therapy. Here, we recruited 28 people with GC-induced obesity and 27 age- and gender-matched healthy controls, whose feces have been collected separately, to delineate the gut microbial characteristics in GC-induced obesity individuals. High-throughput Illumina sequencing targeting the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene has been applied to analyze the structure of the intestinal microbiome. Gas chromatography was also used to measure levels of short-chain   (SCFAs), a subset of key gut microbial metabolites mainly produced by Bacteroidetes. We found dramatically decreased gut microbial diversity in individuals with GC-induced obesity. In addition, the bacterial communities of the GC-induced obesity group were enriched in Firmicutes (e.g., genus Streptococcus) and depleted in Bacteroidetes. Furthermore,  content was decreased in GC-induced obesity status. Overall, this study conducted a case-control study with 55 participants in which we analyzed gut microbiota to develop intestinal microbial profiles of patients undergoing long-term treatment with GCs.

When 30 g/L of acetic acid was used as a carbon source, direct addition of de-lignified loofah sponge or sawdust increased the extracellular lipid content to 33.94% and 53.25%, respectively. The latter reduced the energy input of lipid extraction process from 0.86 to 0.57 GJ per ton of biodiesel production. To relieve the inhibition caused by 40 g/L acetic acid, immobilization of oleaginous yeast on de-lignified sawdust increased the lipid concentration and yield from 3.83 g/L, 0.18 g/g C to 7.15 g/L, 0.20 g/g C, respectively. These improvements occurred due to the cell-immobilized sawdust which play an important role in the loading of cells and adsorption of acetic acid.

In contrast, pigs in a natural setting are manipulating fibre-rich plant material from a young age. Moreover, dietary fibre affects gastrointestinal tract (GIT) development and health in older pigs. We hypothesised that supplemental diets that contain vegetal fibres are accelerating GIT development in suckling piglets in terms of size and functionality. From d 2 of life, sow-suckled piglets had access to a low fibre diet (CON), a diet with a fermentable long-chain arabinoxylan (lc-AXOS), a diet with a largely non-fermentable purified cellulose (CELL), or a diet containing both fibres. During the initial 2 weeks, the control diet was a high-density milk replacer, followed by a dry and highly digestible creep meal. Upon weaning at 25 d, 15 piglets from each treatment group, identified as eaters and originating from six or seven litters, were sacrificed for post-mortem examination of GIT morphology, small intestinal permeability and metabolic profile of the digesta. The microbiota composition of the mid-colon was evaluated in a sub-set of ten piglets.No major statistical interactions between the fibre sources were observed. Piglets consumed the fibre-containing milk supplements and creep diets well. Stomach size and small intestinal permeability was not affected. Large intestinal fill was increased with lc-AXOS only, while relative large intestinal weight was increased with both fibre sources ( < 0.050). Also, CELL decreased ileal pH and tended to increase ileal DM content compared to CON ( < 0.050). Moreover, the concentration of  was increased in the caecum ( < 0.100) and mid-colon ( < 0.050) by addition of CELL. lc-AXOS only stimulated caecal propionate ( < 0.050). The microbiota composition showed a high individual variation and limited dietary impact. Nonetheless, CELL induced minor shifts in specific genera, with notable reductions of -.Adding dietary fibres to the supplemental diet of suckling piglets altered large intestinal morphology but not small intestinal permeability.

The methane yield of PAC reactor (dosage of PAC is 50% of the  solids) amounted to 210 mL·gVS, which is 49% higher than that of control. PAC addition significantly enhanced the biodegradation process, as the reduction rate of total solids (TS) and  solids (VS) were increased by 36.4% and 34.1%, respectively, compared to the control. Inhibitory substrate adsorption experiments showed that PAC has significant adsorption (13.6 mg g) for VFAs, while PG showed almost no adsorption (0.81 mg g). Microbial community structure analysis showed hydrogenotrophic methanogens (Methanobrevibacter and Methanosphaera) were reduced in the PAC reactor, while methanogens (Methanobacterium) which can also use formate as electron donor were increased. PAC amendment reshaped the microbial community in the SS-DAD system which may result in shifting of the major electron carrier from hydrogen to formate and increasing electron transfer efficiency of the SS-DAD system.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The present study aimed to investigate the impact of AMPs on ameliorating rumen fermentation function and rumen microorganisms in goats. Eighteen 4-month-old Chuanzhong black goats were used in a 60-day experiment (6 goats per group). Group I was used as the control and was fed a basal diet, the group II were fed the basal diet supplemented with 2 g of AMPs [per goat/day] and group III were fed the basal diet supplemented 3 g of AMPs [per goat/day], respectively. Rumen fluid samples were collected at 0, 20 and 60 days. Bacterial 16S rRNA genes and ciliate protozoal 18S rRNA genes were amplified by PCR from DNA extracted from rumen samples. The amplicons were sequenced by Illumina MiSeq. Rumen fermentation parameters and digestive enzyme activities were also examined. Our results showed that dietary supplementation with AMPs increased the levels of the bacterial genera Fibrobacter, Anaerovibrio and Succiniclasticum and also increased the ciliates genus Ophryoscolex, but reduced the levels of the bacterial genera Selenomonas, Succinivibrio and Treponema, and the ciliate genera Polyplastron, Entodinium, Enoploplastron and Isotricha. Supplementation with AMPs increased the activities of xylanase, pectinase and lipase in the rumen, and also increased the concentrations of acetic acid, propionic acid and total . These changes were associated with improved growth performance in the goats. The results revealed that the goats fed AMPs showed improved rumen microbiota structures, altered ruminal fermentation, and improved efficiency regarding the utilization of feed; thereby indicating that AMPs can improve growth performance. AMPs are therefore suitable as feed additives in juvenile goats.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31610486>Effect of low severity hydrothermal pretreatment on anaerobic digestion performance of corn stover.</a></h2><p>The anaerobic digestion (AD) performance of corn stover was investigated under low hydrothermal pretreatment (HP) severity. Pretreated corn stover, with and without ammonia was examined at the three temperatures (50, 70, and 90 °C) coupled with different pretreatment time (24-72 h). The results showed that the pH value decreased with increasing pretreatment time for the same temperature. The highest  (VFAs) concentration (4616.23 mg/L) was achieved at a HP severity of 4.56. The highest removal rate of cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin were 19.62%, 25.53%, and 32.91% for HP with ammonia (HPA) severities of 3.34, 3.34, and HP severity of 4.35, respectively. The maximum methane yield of corn stover was 148.19 mL/g∙VS under 50 °C held for 24 h (HPA severity of 2.59), which was 31.35% higher than that of the untreated corn stover. The research results suggest that properly pretreatment severity can play an important role in promoting methane production.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, a full-scale pilot testing was performed with side-by-side operation of a conventional anaerobic-anoxic-aerobic (A2O) process versus a S2EBPR process. A comparison of the performance, activity and microbial community between the two configurations was performed. The results demonstrated that, with the same influent wastewater characteristics, S2EBPR configuration showed improved P removal performance and stability than the conventional A2O configuration, especially when the mixers in the side-stream anaerobic reactor were operated intermittently. Mass balance analysis illustrated that both denitrification and EBPR were enhanced in S2EBPR configuration, where return activated sludge was diverted into the anaerobic zone to promote fermentation and enrichment of polyphosphate accumulating organisms (PAOs), and the influent was bypassed to the anoxic zone for enhancing denitrification. A relatively higher PAO activity and total PAO abundance were observed in S2EBPR than in A2O configuration, accompanied by a higher degree of dependence on glycolysis pathway than tricarboxylic acid cycle. No significant difference in the relative abundances of putative PAOs, including Ca. Accumulibacter and Tetrasphaera, were observed between the two configurations. However, higher microbial community diversity indices were observed in S2EBPR configuration than in conventional one. In addition, consistently lower relative abundance of known glycogen accumulating organisms (GAOs) was observed in S2EBPR system. Extended anaerobic retention time and conditions that generate continuous and more complex  in the side-stream anaerobic reactor of S2EBPR process likely give more competitive advantage for PAOs over GAOs. PAOs exhibited sustained EBPR activity and delayed decay under extended anaerobic condition, likely due to their versatile metabolic pathways depending on the availability and utilization of multiple intracellular polymers. This study provided new insights into the effects of implementing side-stream EBPR configuration on microbial populations, EBPR activity profiles and resulted system performance.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The aim of this study was to determine the effect of fish meal (FM) and mealworm meal (MWM) included in complete pelleted diets on nutrient digestibility and gastrointestinal function in chinchillas. The experiment was performed on 24 male, divided into three groups, n=8. Control group (C) was fed a diet containing 10% soybean meal (SBM). In the experimental group FM, chinchillas received a diet containing 3% fish meal, and the diet administered to the experimental group MWM was supplemented with 4% dried mealworm larvae meal. The nutrient digestibility of diets was determined. At the end of the experiment animals were euthanized and their digestive tracts were removed to analyze gut activity. FM group animals were characterized by lower crude fat digestibility, whereas both alternative protein sources improved the digestibility of acid detergent fiber (ADF). A considerable increase in the activity of cecal intracellular and extracellular bacterial enzymes (in particular β-glucosidase, β-galactosidase and β-xylosidase) was noted in the FM group, which however did not increase the concentrations of short-chain   (). The inclusion of MWM in chinchilla diets shifted the bacterial fermentation site from the cecum (lowest  pool) to the colon (highest  pool), thus enabling to derive additional energy from less digestible dietary components. In conclusion, chinchilla diets can be supplemented with small amounts of animal protein such as fish meal and dried mealworm larvae meal.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31581733>Specific Wheat Fractions Influence Hepatic Fat Metabolism in Diet-Induced Obese Mice.</a></h2><p>Low whole grain consumption is a risk factor for the development of non-communicable diseases such as type 2 diabetes. Dietary fiber and phytochemicals are bioactive grain compounds, which could be involved in mediating these beneficial effects. These compounds are not equally distributed in the wheat grain, but are enriched in the bran and aleurone fractions. As little is known on physiological effects of different wheat fractions, the aim of this study was to investigate this aspect in an obesity model. For twelve weeks, C57BL/6J mice were fed high-fat diets (HFD), supplemented with one of four wheat fractions: whole grain flour, refined white flour, bran, or aleurone. The different diets did not affect body weight, however bran and aleurone decreased liver triglyceride content, and increased hepatic n-3 polyunsaturated  acid (PUFA) concentrations. Furthermore, lipidomics analysis revealed increased PUFA concentration in the lipid classes of phosphatidylcholine (PC), PC-ether, and phosphatidylinositol in the plasma of mice fed whole grain, bran, and aleurone supplemented diets, compared to refined white flour. Furthermore, bran, aleurone, and whole grain supplemented diets increased microbial α-diversity, but only bran and aleurone increased the cecal concentrations of short-chain  . The effects on hepatic lipid metabolism might thus at least partially be mediated by microbiota-dependent mechanisms.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31686768>Prebiotic UG1601 mitigates constipation-related events in association with gut microbiota: A randomized placebo-controlled intervention study.</a></h2><p>Constipation is a common functional gastrointestinal disorder and its etiology is multifactorial. Growing evidence suggests that intestinal dysbiosis is associated with the development of constipation. Prebiotics are subjected to bacterial fermentation in the gut to produce short-chain   (SCFAs), which can help relieve constipation symptoms. The prebiotic UG1601 consists of inulin, lactitol, and aloe vera gel, which are known laxatives, but randomized, controlled clinical trials that examine the effects of this supplement on gut microbiota composition are lacking.To assess the efficacy of the prebiotic UG1601 in suppressing constipation-related adverse events in subjects with mild constipation.Adults with a stool frequency of less than thrice a week were randomized to receive either prebiotics or a placebo supplement for 4 wk. All participants provided their fecal and blood samples at baseline and at the end of intervention. Gastrointestinal symptoms and stool frequency were evaluated. The concentrations of serum endotoxemia markers and fecal SCFAs were determined. The relative abundance of -producing bacteria and the gut microbial community in the responders and non-responders in the prebiotics supplementation group were evaluated.There were no significant differences in gastrointestinal symptoms between groups, although the prebiotic group showed greater symptom improvement. However, after prebiotic usage, serum cluster of differentiation (CD) 14 and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) concentrations were significantly decreased (CD14,  = 0.012; LPS,  < 0.001). The change in LPS concentration was significantly larger in the prebiotic group than in the placebo group ( < 0.001). Fecal SCFAs concentrations did not differ between groups, while the relative abundance of , a major butyrate producer, was significantly increased in the prebiotic group ( = 0.045). The abundances of the phylum Firmicutes and the family Lachnospiraceae (phylum Firmicutes, class Clostridia) ( = 0.009) were decreased in the responders within the prebiotic group. In addition, the proportions of the phylum Firmicutes, the class Clostridia, and the order Clostridiales were inversely correlated with several fecal SCFAs ( < 0.05).Alterations in gut microbiota composition, including a decrease in the phylum Firmicutes and an increase in butyrate-producing bacteria, following prebiotic UG1601 supplementation might help alleviate symptom scores and endotoxemia.©The Author(s) 2019.

However, the metabolite-sensing G-protein-coupled receptors that regulate colonic ILC3s remain poorly understood. We found that colonic ILC3s expressed Ffar2, a microbial metabolite-sensing receptor, and that Ffar2 agonism promoted ILC3 expansion and function. Deficiency of Ffar2 in ILC3s decreased their in situ proliferation and ILC3-derived interleukin-22 (IL-22) production. This led to impaired gut epithelial function characterized by altered mucus-associated proteins and antimicrobial peptides and increased susceptibility to colonic injury and bacterial infection. Ffar2 increased IL-22 CCR6 ILC3s and influenced ILC3 abundance in colonic lymphoid tissues. Ffar2 agonism differentially activated AKT or ERK signaling and increased ILC3-derived IL-22 via an AKT and STAT3 axis. Our findings suggest that Ffar2 regulates colonic ILC3 proliferation and function, and they identify an ILC3-receptor signaling pathway modulating gut homeostasis and pathogen defense.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Three Mono Trap RCC18 adsorbents were used to extract samples.  components were analyzed by gas phase-olfaction-mass spectrometry. The main odor-active substances were identified by aroma extraction dilution analysis. The overall odor profile was analyzed by electronic nose. Overall sensory evaluation showed that metallic and grassy in Chinese carp were heavier than those in American. Trimethylamine, ketones, aldehydes, and alcohols were the main odor components in the two species. Flavor dilution factors indicated that hexanal (grassy), 1-octen-3-ol (mushroom-like), and 2,3-pentanedione (milky) were important. Trimethylamine, 1-pentene-3-ol, 2,3-pentanedione, pentanal, 3-methyl-1-butanol, hexanal, 1-Hexanol, heptanal, 1-heptanol, 1-octen-3-ol, octanal, 2,3-pentanedione. D-limonene, nonanal, decanal, and naphthalene were the main flavor substances. The contents and intensities of  substances are generally higher in American than in Chinese silver carp. PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: The large numbers of American silver carp are problematic in the Great Lakes. Pollution of the water environment may cause contamination in the fish body and the smell of freshwater fish is heavy and unacceptable.

In this study, thermal-alkaline (THALK), ozonation (OZN), electrolysis (EC) and NaClO-promoted electrolysis (EC-AOP) were investigated to facilitate WAS solubilization and production of  (VFAs). EEMF-PARAFAC and FT-ICR-MS were employed to characterize the transformation of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in WAS fermentation liquors at molecular level. THALK achieved the highest fluorescence intensity of C1 protein after pretreatment. Proteins and lipids were the dominant DOM in the pretreated WAS, while the DOM shifted towards substances with higher H/C and lower O/C after fermentation. The BNR results showed that THALK (100%) and EC-AOP (96.9%) outperformed other groups (78.9-90.3%) in terms of NO-N removal, indicating the significant impact of DOM compositions. Overall, these results demonstrated that THALK and EC-AOP effectively enhanced release of VFAs and DOM, which subsequently improved NO-N removal efficiency.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The rates of gas production were higher for swedes than for kales ( < 0.01). No differences between the brassica species ( > 0.05) were observed in the total VFA production, whereas kales had a higher proportion of acetate and swedes had higher proportions of butyrate ( < 0.05). Only the swede varieties showed differences in VFA production ( < 0.05). The soluble fraction "a", potential and effective in situ DM degradability were higher in swedes ( < 0.01), but kales presented greater DM and CP degradation rates.

A diet with corn was ground and extruded in two different ways, obtaining Low RS (2.2 g/kg DM; 99.9% of SG) and High RS (15.3 g/kg DM; 62.6% of SG). Each diet was fed to adults (4.0 ± 0.7 years) or old beagle dogs (11.5 ± 0.4 years) in a 2 (ages) x 2 (RS amounts) factorial arrangement with 8 dogs per food. Data were evaluated by analysis of variance, and postprandial responses by analysis of variance of repeated measurements over time ( < 0.05). Diet × age interaction was observed for protein ATTD, with lower values for old dogs fed High RS than those for the other treatments ( < 0.05). No age or diet effect was verified for the ATTD of other nutrients and faecal score. Faecal moisture and pH were higher for adults than that for old dogs ( < 0.05). The High RS food increased acetate, propionate and butyrate concentrations in faeces, regardless of age ( < 0.01). Old dogs presented lower acetate and total short-chain   () and higher lactate and ammonia than adults ( < 0.05). Only for old dogs the intake of the High RS food reduced ammonia and increased faecal lactate ( < 0.05). An age × diet interaction was verified for glucose postprandial response, with lower values for old dogs fed High RS food ( < 0.05), while no differences were found for the other treatments. Old dogs had higher postprandial insulin secretion regardless of the diet ( < 0.05), and lower insulin increment at 180 min after the meal when fed the Low RS than when fed the High RS food ( < 0.05). In conclusion, the diet with lower SG and higher RS improved the intestinal microenvironment, with higher butyrate and total  without altering faeces production or score. Old dogs presented less acetate and total  and higher lactate and ammonia in faeces than adults. The High RS food increased lactate and reduced ammonia in faeces of old dogs, with possible positive influences for gut health. Old dogs had higher postprandial insulin secretion than that of adults to maintain blood glucose, and the diet with higher RS content reduced the postprandial glucose response of old dogs.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31661720>Changes of gut microbiota during silybin mediated treatment of high-fat diet-induced nonalcoholic  liver diseasein mouse.</a></h2><p>Gut microbiota involved in pathogenesis of nonalcoholic  liver disease (NAFLD).

In the present experiment, we study the function of acetate (a major  in the rabbit gut) on fat metabolism. Ninety rabbits (40 days of age) were randomly divided into three groups: a sham control group (injection of saline for four days); a group experiencing subcutaneous injection of acetate for four days (2 g/kg BM per day, one injection each day, acetate); and a pair-fed sham treatment group.

Activated G protein-coupled receptor 41/43, adenosine monophosphate activated protein kinase (AMPK) and extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2 signal pathways were likely to participate in the regulation in lipid accumulation of acetate. Acetate reduced hepatic triglyceride content by inhibiting  acid synthesis, enhancing  acid oxidation and lipid output. Inhibited peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α () and activated AMPK and ERK1/2 signal pathways were related to the process in liver.

The zero-liquid-discharge (ZLD) method of combining FGD brines and CCRs in solidification/stabilization (S/S) is promising due to its potential of treating both wastes in the same process. This study evaluated the performance of such a ZLD method for immobilizing heavy metals (Se, As, Cd and Cr) and chloride in FGD wastewater and/or CCRs. Effects of different coal fly ash (bituminous (BCFA) and sub-bituminous ()), activating agent (Portland cement (PC) and lime) and pretreatment of brines by zero valent iron (ZVI) on the S/S process were evaluated. Short-term and long-term leaching tests were conducted to evaluate performance of the S/S solids in pollutant retainment. The pre-treatment of FGD brine by ZVI enhanced the retainment of heavy metals when BCFA was used, but not when  was used since it already performed quite well without ZVI pretreatment. Quantitative X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy analyses strongly indicated the formation of Friedel's salt, CaAl(OH)(Cl,OH)·2HO, is critical in the retainment of heavy metals and chloride.  contained higher lime and reactive aluminate contents than BCFA; thus, S/S solids made with  contained higher amounts of Friedel's salt.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, sixteen growing pigs were infused with saline or sodium propionate solution (25 mL, 2 mol/L), respectively through a cecal fistula twice a day during a 28 days experimental period. The results showed that the cecal infusion of the  propionate decreased serum and liver triglyceride levels, and increased serum PYY secretion in growing pigs. Hepatic metabolomics identified 12 metabolites that were significantly altered by propionate. These included decreased levels of lipid metabolism related stearic acid and glycerol-2-phosphate; increased levels of TCA cycle components including malic acid, fructose-6-phosphate, and succinic acid; and decreased levels of the amino acid metabolism products aspartic acid and serine. Hepatic transcriptomics demonstrated that propionate inhibited  acid synthesis and promoted lipid metabolic process.

Total Clematis triterpenoid saponins (CTSs) prepared from Clematis mandshurica Rupr. possess therapeutic benefits for arthritic diseases. However, the poor pharmacokinetic properties of CTSs have obstructed the translation of these natural agents to drugs. Here, we examined the effects of CTSs on arthritis symptoms, gut microbiota and SCFAs in rats with collagen-induced arthritis (CIA). Our results showed that the arthritis index scores of CIA rats treated with CTSs were significantly lower than those of the model group. Most importantly, CTSs moderated gut microbial dysbiosis and significantly downregulated the total  concentration in CIA rats. Compared to the control group, CTSs treatment have no significant side effects on the gut microbiota and  metabolism in normal rats. Two differential analyses (LEfSe and DESeq2) were combined to study the details of the changes in gut microbiome, and twenty-four marker taxa at the genus level were identified via a comparison among control, model and CIA rats treated with high doses of CTSs. In particular, the mostly significantly increased gram-negative (G) and decreased gram-positive (G) genera in CIA rats were well restored by CTSs. The observed  concentrations demonstrated that CTSs tend to maintain the balance of the gut microbiota. The data presented herein suggest that CTSs could ameliorate arthritis-associated gut microbial dysbiosis and may be potential adjuvant drugs that could provide relief from the gastrointestinal damage caused as a side effect of commonly used drugs.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The minimum inhibitory concentration/minimum bactericidal concentration test was conducted. Bacteria were treated with a , together with clinically used endodontic treatment methods such as triple antibiotics (metronidazole, minocycline, and ciprofloxacin) and chlorhexidine gluconate (CHX) to determine the effects of combination treatment. Of the SCFAs, propionate had a bacteriostatic effect, inhibiting the growth of E. faecalis in a dose-dependent manner and also that of clinical strains of E. faecalis isolated from dental plaques. Meanwhile, acetate and butyrate had minimal effects on E. faecalis growth. Moreover, propionate inhibited the growth of other Enterococci including E. faecium. In addition, combination treatment of propionate and triple antibiotics led to further growth inhibition, whereas no cooperative effect was observed at propionate plus CHX. These results indicate that propionate attenuates the growth of Enterococci, suggesting propionate as a potential agent to control Enterococcal infections, especially when combined with triple antibiotics.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31597393>Extensive Ruminant Production Systems and Milk Quality with Emphasis on Unsaturated  Compounds, Antioxidant Protection Degree and Phenol Content.</a></h2><p>Dairy products from grazing ruminant have numerous positive effects on human health thanks to their higher content essential  , vitamins, and polyphenols. Compared to livestock fed a conventional maize silage- and/or grain-based diet, grass-fed livestock produce milk with higher levels of n-3  , vitamins A, E, carotenoids, and phenols. The effect is even more pronounced if animals are grazing on legume/forbs-rich grasslands. This review argues, based on the available literature, about the effect of grazing ruminant on milk and cheese quality, including the hedonistic aspects, pointing out the link between territory and dairy products quality (Protected Designation Origin; Protected Geografic Origin; namely PDO and PGI labels). Moreover, it points out the main plant biomarkers which can be used to discriminate grazing sourced from stall-fed sourced milk and dairy products. Overall milk and cheese sourced from grazing animals (cows, sheep and goat) showed higher levels (compared to stall system) of FA, vitamins, phenols, putatively beneficial for consumers' health. FA and plant secondary metabolites can also affect flavor and some nutritional and technological features of dairy products such as their antioxidant protection degree. This would favour a fair pricing of dairy products sourced from grazing systems and the persistence of viable and sustainable extensive production systems.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31421592>Effect of thermal activated peroxydisulfate pretreatment on short-chain   production from waste activated sludge anaerobic fermentation.</a></h2><p>The effect of thermal activation of peroxydisulfate (PDS) pretreatment on anaerobic fermentation (AF) of waste activated sludge (WAS) was investigated. WAS pretreatment was conducted at 35 °C and 55 °C with PDS dosage increasing from 0.1 to 0.9 mM/g TSS (total suspended solids). Experimental results showed that sludge solubilization and short chain   (SCFAs) production were significantly improved after pretreatment, while methanogenesis was severely inhibited. The maximum total SCFAs yield of 3183.51 mg COD/L occurred at 55 °C with 0.3 mM PDS/g TSS addition and day 9 of AF, which was 2.1, 1.3 and 1.1 fold of the blank, 55 °C and 35 °C + 0.3 mM PDS/g TSS pretreated samples, respectively. In addition, thermal activated PDS pretreatment could enhance the dewaterability of fermented sludge, which was advantageous for subsequent disposal of sludge.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The composition of the microbiome in IF represents an important variable in the physiology and prognosis of this disease.We sought to compare the intestinal microbiome and  concentration of children who require parenteral nutrition (PN) with that of children with short-bowel syndrome (SBS) who have discontinued PN and with age-matched controls, using high-throughput sequencing to investigate host-microbe interactions.Fifty-three samples were submitted over 6-15 months. Six children with SBS + IF submitted 34 samples, and 6 children with SBS with discontinued PN submitted 15 samples; these were compared with samples from 5 control children. Fecal samples were analyzed by 16S ribosomal RNA partial gene sequencing using the MiSeq Illumina sequencer. SCFAs were measured in stool samples by mass spectrometry.Butyrate quantity was near absent in children with IF compared with that in controls (median 0.37 nmol/mg vs 10.92 nmol/mg; P < .0001). Similarly, commensal anaerobes known to produce , including Ruminococcaceae and Lachnospiraceae, were reduced in those with SBS. SBS + IF enteric samples demonstrated a 168-fold increase in the relative abundance of the Escherichia genus seemingly attributable to the species Escherichia coli.The reduced relative abundance of butyrate-producing Clostridia as well as decreased intestinal butyrate concentration in children with IF support further investigation in therapeutic options that target butyrate-producing bacterial communities or butyrate supplementation.© 2019 American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31602443>Altered short chain  acid profiles induced by dietary fiber intervention regulate AMPK levels and intestinal homeostasis.</a></h2><p>The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of dietary intervention on intestinal microbiota-mediated change in short chain  acid () profile and intestinal homeostasis. Sequencing of the 16S rDNA of gut bacteria, metagenomics, intestinal epithelial transcriptomics, and metabonomics were conducted. Results showed that the dietary interventions altered the microbiota composition of cecal digesta, microbiota-mediated metabolism, and the gene expression profile in intestinal epithelial cells. Compared with red meat-diet-fed mice, fiber-diet-fed mice presented a shift in the gut microbiome toward increased production of butanoate, which was accompanied by up-regulation of microbiota- and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-dependent gene expression and decrease in serum concentrations of trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), triglyceride (TG) and glucose (GLU). The results suggested a new regulatory mechanism via which butanoate and AMPK activation contributed to intestinal integrity and homeostasis by affecting metabolism, intestinal barrier function and transporter expression.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31552757>Effects of dietary alpha-ketoglutarate on bacteria profiles in the faeces of lactating sows and their suckling piglets.</a></h2><p>The aim of the study was to investigate the effects of dietary alpha-ketoglutarate (AKG) on the faecal bacteria composition of suckling piglets after supplementation of AKG to the diet of lactating sows. After farrowing, the sows were assigned to either a normal lactation diet (control group,  = 12) or a diet supplemented with 0.25% AKG (AKG group,  = 12) based on body weight (BW) and parity. During the 21-d suckling period, BW and diarrhoea occurrences of piglets were recorded daily, while faeces were sampled weekly from sows and piglets. The levels of pH, ammonia, short-chain   () and lactate in the faeces of piglets were determined. In particular, bacteria profiles in faeces of sows and their suckling piglets were examined by Illumina sequencing. The results showed that the AKG diet altered the faecal bacteria composition in sows during the 21-d lactation period, leading to increases ( < 0.05) in the abundances of genera  and , but decreases ( < 0.05) in the abundances of genera  and . AKG supplement to the sows during lactation indirectly enhanced (< 0.05) bacterial richness and  levels (especially, acetate) in the faeces of piglets during the 21-d suckling period. It is suggested that maternal AKG supplementation alters the composition of faecal bacteria in the sows, and increases the faecal bacteria richness and acetate levels in the piglets, which might be associated with an enhanced growth performance of piglets.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31591683>Comprehensive relationships between gut microbiome and faecal metabolome in individuals with type 2 diabetes and its complications.</a></h2><p>As the treatment regimens such as metformin could confound the correlation between type 2 diabetes (T2D) and gut microbiome, we should revisit the relationship between gut microbiota and T2D patients who are not currently treated with metformin.The study recruited 65 T2D patients: 49 with and 16 without diabetic complications, and 35 healthy controls. We sequenced the 16S rRNA V3-V4 region of gut microbiota and detected metabolites based on liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC/MS) and gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC/MS) in faecal samples.The composition of both the gut microbiota and faecal metabolites changed significantly with T2D patients. The abundance of Proteobacteria and the ratio of Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes were higher in T2D patients than healthy subjects, and the short chain   (SCFAs), bile  and lipids of T2D patients were significantly disordered. Moreover, the abundances of certain -producing bacteria (Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae etc.) were significantly increased in T2D patients, while the faecal SCFAs concentrations were significantly decreased. It's suggested that the role of -producing bacteria was not simply to produce SCFAs. Then we identified 44 microbial modules to explore the correlations between the gut microbiota and metabolic traits. Specially, most modules including certain -producing bacteria were comprehensively correlated to body mass index, the levels of blood glucose, blood pressure, blood cholesterol and faecal bile  and lipids.Our study identified the relationships between the gut microbiota and faecal metabolites, and provided a resource for future studies to understand host-gut microbiota interactions in T2D.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31419123>Methyl Jasmonate Promotes Phospholipid Remodeling and Jasmonic Acid Signaling To Alleviate Chilling Injury in Peach Fruit.</a></h2><p>Chilling injury (CI) is a physiological disorder induced by cold, which heavily limit crop production and postharvest preservation worldwide. Methyl jasmonate (MeJA) can alleviate CI in various fruit species, including peach; however, the underlying molecular mechanism is poorly understood. Here, changes in contents of phenolics, lipids, and jasmonic acid (JA) and gene expressions are compared between MeJA and control fruit. Exogenous MeJA inhibited expressions of , , and  but did not affect the phenolic content. Furthermore, MeJA fruit showed lower relative electrolyte leakage, indicating less membrane damage. Meanwhile, the enrichment of linoleic acid in the potential lipid biomarkers, especially phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, and phosphatidylglycerol, coincided with lower expressions of  but higher  and JA content. In the JA signaling pathway, MeJA significantly upregulated expressions of  and  but downregulated .

Insects embody a promising answer for being highly nutritious and for showing traits leading to a circular bioeconomy. Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) at sea-water stage was fed diets with a partial or complete substitution of fishmeal with meal of Hermetia illucens larvae reared on a media containing Ascophyllum nodosum mixed with organic wastes (60:40). The present study aimed to assess the quality of fillets by characterizing its physico-chemical traits with conventional and innovative methods, such as proton transfer reaction-time of flight-mass spectrometer (PTR-ToF-MS) technique, allowing to analyze samples at room temperature. Finally, steamed fillets underwent a consumer test to enquire the liking of consumers and their intention of re-consumption.Our main findings showed that a complete dietary substitution of fishmeal with H. illucens larvae meal did not impair the physico-chemical quality of A. salmon fillets. Notably, neutral n-3 polyunsaturated   (PUFA) slightly but significantly increased in the fillets of A. salmon fed H. illucens, also due to the additional fish oil present in the diets containing insect. The  organic profile was not altered by the different diets. The consumer liking test revealed that Italian consumers appreciated the tested salmon irrespective of the administered feed.Tailoring the insect  acid profile by rearing the larvae on a PUFA-rich substrate, coupled with a dietary modulation of the oily source, can successfully maintain or even increase the cardioprotective characteristics of fillets.

Compared with the Fe-free digesters spiked with 200 mg/L SDZ (R), treatments with 5.0 g/L Fe (R) significantly accelerated and optimized the acidification process by enriching Clostridia and Bacteroidia (key members responsible for VFAs/H production), providing more readily available substrates for methanogenesis. Furthermore, Fe increased the overall abundance of hydrogenotrophic methanogens, specifically toxicant resistant Methanoculleus and Methanosphaera spp. were selectively enriched, helping achieve a 36.9% higher CH yield and a 26.4% greater total solids removal efficiency. A positive correlation between the solid content and the SDZ concentration adsorbed in SM was observed. The addition of Fe increased the distribution of SDZ in liquid and facilitated its removal through the enhanced biodegradation and physicochemical processes. Overall, the total SDZ removal efficiency was improved by 86.8% with Fe.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

A high-fat diet combined with a streptozotocin (STZ) abdominal injection were used to induce diabetes in the rats. After 4 weeks, the intestinal histopathological analysis of the ileum was observed by transmission electron microscopy. The fasting blood glucose (FBG), plasma insulin, glucose tolerance (OGTT) and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels were measured. The expression of tight junction (TJ) proteins in the ileum was measured using western blotting. The molecular ecology of the fecal gut microbiota was analyzed by 16S rDNA high-throughput sequencing. The contents of the short-chain   (SCFAs) in feces were measured using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).After propolis treatment, compared to the model group, FBG and HbA1c levels declined, while the glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity index (ISI) increased. The levels of TJ proteins in the ileum increased in the propolis groups. The tight junctions and gap junctions of the intestinal epithelium were also improved in the propolis groups. The contents of the feces acetic acid, propionic acid and butyrate were increased in the propolis groups. 16S rDNA high-throughput sequencing revealed that the composition of the gut microbiota of rats in the propolis supplement group was significantly improved.Compared to the model group, propolis exerted hypoglycemic effects in diabetic rats, and it repaired intestinal mucosal damage, benefited the communities of the gut microbiota and increased  levels in diabetic rats.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Cellular immunity is also impaired, resulting in a higher incidence of viral infections when compared with standard chemotherapy. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivates in seropositive patients under immunosuppression after allogeneic HSCT, causing complications, such as pneumonitis, gastroenteritis, and retinitis. Because intervention before the onset of disease, rather than after, can improve prognosis, preemptive therapy guided by early detection of CMV reactivation has been extensively used. Recently, the introduction of a less myelotoxic agent, letermovir, has enabled prophylactic therapy to be administered safely and effectively. In addition, prophylactic letermovir is expected to reduce transplant-related mortality. However, the onset of CMV infection/disease as either a breakthrough infection or after the discontinuation of letermovir is still problematic.

Our previous study demonstrated that cerebral ischemic stroke triggers dysfunctional gut microbiota and increased intestinal permeability. In this study, we aimed to clarify the mechanism by which gut microbiota and SCFAs can treat cerebral ischemic stroke in rat middle cerebral artery occlusion models and use the information to develop new therapies. Our results show that oral administration of non-absorbable antibiotics reduced neurological impairment and the cerebral infarct volume, relieved cerebral edemas, and decreased blood lipid levels by altering the gut microbiota. We also found that ischemic stroke decreased intestinal levels of SCFAs. And that transplanting fecal microbiota rich in these metabolites was an effective means of treating the condition. Compared with other SCFAs, butyric acid showed the highest negative correlation with ischemic stroke. Supplementation with butyric acid treated models of ischemic stroke effectively by remodeling the gut microbiota, enriching the beneficial Lactobacillus, and repairing the leaky gut. In conclusion, interfering with the gut microbiota by transplanting fecal bacteria rich in SCFAs and supplementing with butyric acid were found to be effective treatments for cerebral ischemic stroke.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

We investigated the persistence of differences in CH emission between groups of cows categorized as either low or high emitters over a 5-mo period. Two feeding regimens (pasture vs. indoors) were used. Early- to mid-lactation Holstein Friesian cows were categorized as low or high emitters (n = 10 each) retrospectively, using predictions from milk mid-infrared (MIR) spectra, before the start of the experiment. Data from MIR estimates and from measurements with the GreenFeed (GF; C-Lock Technology Inc., Rapid City, SD) system over the 5-mo experiment were combined into 7-, 14-, and 28-d periods. Feed intake, eating and ruminating behavior, and ruminal fluid traits were determined in two 7-d measurement periods in the grazing season. The CH emission data were analyzed using a split-plot ANOVA, and the repeatability of each of the applied methods for determining CH emission was calculated. Traits other than CH emission were analyzed for differences between low and high emitters using a linear mixed model. The initial category-dependent differences in daily CH production persisted over the subsequent 5 mo and across 2 feeding regimens with both methods. The repeatability analysis indicated that the biweekly milk control scheme, and even a monthly scheme as practiced on farms, might be sufficient for confirming category differences. However, the relationship between CH data estimated by MIR and measured with GF for individual cows was weak (R = 0.26). The categorization based on CH production also generated differences in CH emission per kilogram of milk; differentiation between cow categories was not persistent based on milk MIR spectra and GF. Compared with the high emitters, low emitters tended to show a lower acetate-to-propionate ratio in ruminal , whereas feed intake and ruminating time did not differ. Interestingly, the low emitters spent less time eating than the high emitters. In conclusion, the CH estimation from analyzing the milk MIR spectra is an appropriate proxy to form and regularly control categories of cows with different CH production levels. The categorization was also sufficient to secure similar and persistent differences in emission intensity when estimated by MIR spectra of the milk. Further studies are needed to determine whether MIR data from individual cows are sufficiently accurate for breeding.The Authors.

Batch assays working at pH 6 revealed an increment of 9.0%, 7.9%, and 4.1% (on COD basis) of VFA concentration when adding 2.5%, 3.5%, and 4.5% / of mature compost, respectively, even though the  solids (VS) concentration of food waste was lower in the tests with increasing doses of mature compost. For batch tests at pH 7, this VFA generation improvement was lower, even though enhanced COD solubilization was recorded. Operating in semi-continuous conditions at 35 °C, pH of 6, and hydraulic retention time (HRT) of 3.5 days, the addition of 2.5% / of mature compost led to a VFA concentration up to 51.2 ± 12.3% more (on VS basis) when compared to a reference reactor without compost addition. Moreover, the percentage of butyric acid on VS basis in the fermentation broth working at a pH of 6 increased from up to 12.2 ± 1.9% (0% compost addition) to up to 23.5 ± 2.7% (2.5% compost addition). The VFA production was not improved when a higher percentage of mature compost was used (3.5% instead of 2.5% /), and it slightly decreased when mature compost addition was lowered to 1.5% /. When working at a pH of 7 in the semi-continuous fermenters with the addition of 2.5% / mature compost at an HRT of 3.5 days, an improvement of 79% and 104% of the VFA concentration (on VS basis) were recorded as compared to fermenters working at a pH of 6 with 2.5% and 0% / of mature compost addition, respectively. At a pH of 7, higher production of propionic and valeric  was found with respect to the reactor working at a pH of 6. The effect of pH on VFA generation was estimated to have greater contribution than that of only biological pretreatment using mature compost. At a pH of 7, the VFA yield was higher for the fermenter working with 2.5% / mature compost but at a pH of 7 and HRT of 5 days, the effect of mature compost on VFA production improvement was lower than that obtained at a pH of 6. Moreover, higher solubilization in terms of soluble chemical oxygen demand and total ammonium was detected when biological pretreatment using mature compost was applied at both a pH of 6 and a pH of 7, which indicates enhanced hydrolysis in both conditions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31514374>Effects of Phytonutrients on Ruminal Fermentation, Digestibility, and Microorganisms in Swamp Buffaloes.</a></h2><p>This experiment aimed to use dietary sources containing phytonutrients (PTN) such as mangosteen peel powder (MSP) and banana flower powder (BFP) as sources of phytonutrients. Four swamp buffalo bulls fitted with rumen fistulae were used as experimental animals. A digestion trial covering four periods was used according to a 4 × 4 Latin square design with four treatments: Treatment 1 (T1) = control (Cont), T2 = supplementation of PTN1 fed at 100 g/d, T3 = supplementation of PTN2 fed at 100 g/d, and T4 = supplementation of PTN3 fed at 100 g/d. The experiment was conducted for four periods; each period lasted for 21 days. All animals were fed a concentrate mixture at 0.5% body weight, while rice straw, water, and mineral blocks were fed ad libitum. The findings revealed significant increases in the digestibility of neutral detergent fiber (NDF) and acid detergent fiber (ADF), while no changes in dry matter feed consumption occurred due to PTN supplementation. Rumen fermentation end-products, such as total  (TVFA), propionic acid (C), and butyric acid (C), were notably enhanced ( < 0.05) and there were the highest in PTN2 and PTN3, whilst acetic acid (C) was significantly decreased with PTN supplementation groups. Furthermore, the rumen protozoal population was suppressed ( < 0.05), which resulted in decreased rumen methane production ( < 0.05), while the bacterial population was enhanced. Using PTN sources can improve rumen fermentation as well as mitigating rumen methane production.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31654924>Biogas production estimation using data-driven approaches for cold region municipal wastewater anaerobic digestion.</a></h2><p>The objective of this study was to estimate biogas (including methane, carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulphide) production rates from the anaerobic digesters at the Saskatoon Wastewater Treatment Plant (SWTP), Saskatchewan, Canada. Average daily ambient temperatures typically fluctuate between -40 °C and 30 °C over the year making the management of the SWTP processes challenging. Operating parameters were taken from 2014 to 2016 including  (VFAs), total solids, fixed solids,  solids, pH, and inflow rate. The input parameters were processed using two methods including a correlation test and principal component analysis (PCA) to determine highly correlated variables prior to use in models. The two models used to estimate biogas production rates are a multi-layered perceptron feed forward artificial neural network (ANN) and an adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) with grid partition (GP), subtractive clustering (SC) and fuzzy c-means clustering (FCMC). The models using PCA processed variables had reasonable performances with shorter model processing times, while reducing model input data. Among various structures of ANN and ANFIS models for estimation of biogas generation, the ANFIS-FCMC results had better agreement with the observed data. Its average approximation of emission rates of CH, CO and HS from the wastewater digesters were 3,086, 6,351, and 41.5 g/min, respectively. Our group is assessing similar estimation methodology for the remaining SWTP wastewater treatment processes that are more highly impacted by the seasonal temperature variations including primary and secondary treatment processes.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Guidelines for laboratory studies stipulate specific densities, sex ratios, and biting rates, whereas those for field studies are governmentally required before a promising repellent can be registered for human use. These protocols stipulate minimum biting rates alone. Relatively little is known, however, about the influence of mosquito density and sex ratio on their biting propensity, either in the field or laboratory. Using Environmental Protection Agency guidelines for cage testing, we studied the influence of mosquito density and sex ratio in laboratory repellency tests of the biopesticide Ethyl butylacetylaminopropionate (IR3535) (20%) against three mosquito species (, , and ). DEET [3-(-acetyl--butyl) aminopropionic acid ethyl ester] (20%) in a laboratory prepared formulation was used as a comparison article. Studies were conducted by trained investigators at the BioAgri Laboratories in Brazil. We found that higher mosquito density generally decreased protection time, but that the influence of sex ratio was more complex. The presence of male mosquitoes increased protection times against  and  perhaps because mate-seeking males interfered with female feeding. Interestingly, by contrast, protection times decreased against  in the presence of males. Such considerations may potentially assist in improving the match between cage and field testing under a broader range of conditions that permit more accurate labeling of repellents for safe and effective use by consumers.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31433440>Sea buckthorn seed oil reduces blood cholesterol and modulates gut microbiota.</a></h2><p>Sea buckthorn seed oil (SBSO) has been used as a functional food in the prevention of heart diseases. The present study investigates the effects of SBSO on blood cholesterol and the gut microbiota in hypercholesterolemia hamsters. Four groups of hamsters (n = 8 each) were given one of four diets, namely a non-cholesterol control diet (NCD), a high-cholesterol control diet (HCD) containing 0.1% cholesterol, and an HCD diet with sea buckthorn seed oil replacing 50% lard (SL) or replacing 100% lard (SH). Feeding SL and SH diets could reduce blood total cholesterol by 20-22%. This was accompanied by the down-regulation of the gene expression of acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase 2 (ACAT2), microsomal triacylglycerol transport protein (MTP), and ATP-binding cassette transporter8 (ABCG8). SBSO supplementation also increased the production of intestinal short-chain   and fecal outputs of neutral sterols. Metagenomic analysis demonstrated that feeding SL and SH diets could favorably modulate the relative abundance of Bacteroidales_S24-7_group, Ruminococcaceae, and Eubacteriaceae. It was therefore concluded that SBSO was effective in reducing blood cholesterol in hypercholesterolemic hamsters via increasing intestinal cholesterol excretion and promoting the growth of -producing bacteria.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31561307>Assessment of perfluoroalkyl substances levels in tap and bottled water samples from Turkey.</a></h2><p>Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) draw considerable attention for their potential toxic effects in humans and environment. Drinking water is accepted as one of the major exposure pathways for PFASs. In this study, we measured concentrations of 10 perfluoroalkyl substances in 94 tap water samples collected in two different sampling periods (August 2017 and February 2018) from 33 provinces of Turkey, as well as in 26 different brands of plastic and glass-bottled water samples sold in supermarkets in Turkey. Perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA), perfluorobutane sulfonate (PFBS) and perfluoropentanoic acid (PFPeA) were the most frequently detected PFASs in the samples of tap waters. The maximum concentrations in tap waters were measured as 2.90, 2.37, 2.18, 2.04, and 1.93 ng/L, for PFHxA, perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS), perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), and perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA), respectively. The most abundant perfluorinated chemical in tap water samples was PFBA with 17%, followed by PFOS (13%), PFBS (12%), perfluoroheptanoic acid (PFHpA) (11%), PFHxA (11%), and PFOA (11%). The total PFASs concentration in tap water ranged from 0.08 to 11.27 ng/L. As regards bottled waters, the concentrations of PFASs were generally lower than those in tap water samples. These results revealed that tap water samples in Turkey might be considered generally safe based on the established guidelines around the world. However, due to their persistence and potential to accumulate and reach higher concentrations in the environment, careful monitoring of PFASs in all types of water is critical.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

This study evaluated associations of body mass index (BMI) with circulating microbiota biomarkers in African American men (AAM) ( = 75). The main outcomes included fecal microbial community structure (16S rRNA), gut permeability biomarkers (ELISA), and short-chain   (SCFAs, metabolome analysis). These outcomes were compared between obese and non-obese men, after adjusting for age. The results showed that lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP), the ratio of LBP to CD14 (LBP/CD14), and SCFAs (propionic, butyric, isovaleric) were higher in obese ( = 41, age 58 years, BMI 36 kg/m) versus non-obese ( = 34, age 55 years, BMI 26 kg/m) men. BMI correlated positively with LBP, LBP/CD14 ( < 0.05 for both) and SCFAs (propionic, butyric, isovaleric,  < 0.01 for all). In the regression analysis, LBP, LBP/CD14, propionic and butyric  were independent determinants of BMI. The study showed for the first time that selected microbiota biomarkers (LBP, LBP/CD14, propionic and butyric ) together with several other relevant risks explained 39%-47% of BMI variability, emphasizing that factors other than microbiota-related biomarkers could be important. Further research is needed to provide clinical and mechanistic insight into microbiota biomarkers and their utility for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31466285>Administration of an Immune Stimulant during the Transition Period Improved Lipid Metabolism and Rumination without Affecting Inflammatory Status.</a></h2><p>Omnigen-AF (OAF) increases leukocyte functions in immunosuppressed animal models and reduces incidence of infectious diseases in early lactating dairy cows, although its mode of action is still unclear. This study aims to provide a wider perspective of the metabolic effect of OAF to test its potential as a strategy to address metabolic disorders of the transition period. A group of 10 Holstein dairy cows were divided into 2 groups: The treated group (IMS; 5 cows) received 32.5 g of OAF twice a day (65 g d) as top-dress in the morning and afternoon feeds from -55 to 42 days from calving (DFC), whereas the control group (CTR; 5 cows) received no supplementation. From -62 to 42 DFC, body condition score, body weight, dry matter intake, rumination time and milk yield were measured; blood samples were collected weekly to assess a wide hematochemical profile and to test white blood cell functions by  challenge assays. At 30 DFC, rumen fluid was collected and analyzed for pH,  composition, urea nitrogen, and lactate contents. Data were submitted to ANOVA using a mixed model for repeated measures, including treatment, time, and their interaction as fixed effects. OAF decreased blood nonesterified   and beta hydroxybutyrate concentrations and increased rumination time in early lactation. Leukocytes from IMS cows had lower lactate production and lower glucose consumption after  stimulation. OAF did not reduce the acute phase response indicators and reduced the blood concentrations of albumin and antioxidants after calving, suggesting impairment of hepatic functions related to protein synthesis and antioxidant management. Nevertheless, the lack of effect on bilirubin and liver enzymes refutes the possibility of severe liver damage occurring with OAF supplementation. Positive effects in reducing mobilization of body fats and ketogenesis and in increasing rumination time after calving suggest OAF effectiveness in preventing metabolic disorders of the transition period.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31622696>The gut-liver axis in liver disease: pathophysiological basis for therapy.</a></h2><p>The gut-liver axis refers to the bidirectional relationship between the gut and its microbiota, and the liver, resulting from the integration of signals generated by dietary, genetic and environmental factors. This reciprocal interaction is established through the vascular route of the portal vein that carries gut-derived products directly to the liver, and the liver feed-back route of bile and antibody secretion to the intestine. The intestinal mucosal and vascular barrier is the functional and anatomical structure that serves as a playground for the interactions between the gut and the liver, limiting the systemic dissemination of microbes and toxins while allowing nutrients to access the circulation and to reach the liver. The control of microbial communities is critical to maintain homeostasis of the gut-liver axis, and as part of the two-way communication the liver shapes intestinal microbial communities. Alcohol disrupts the gut-liver axis at multiple interconnected levels, including the gut microbiome, mucus, epithelial barrier and antimicrobial peptides production, which increases the microbial exposure and the pro-inflammatory environment of the liver. Growing evidences indicate the pathogenetic role of microbe-derived metabolites, such as trimethylamine, secondary bile ,  and ethanol, in the pathogenesis of non-alcoholic  liver disease. Cirrhosis by itself is associated to profound alterations in gut microbiota and damage at the different levels of defense of the intestinal barrier, including the epithelial, the vascular and the immune barriers. The relevance of the severe disturbance of the intestinal barrier in cirrhosis has been linked to translocation of live bacteria, bacterial infections and disease progression. The identification of the elements of the gut-liver axis primarily damaged in each chronic liver disease offers possibilities to intervention. Beyond antibiotics, upcoming therapies centered in the gut include new generations of probiotics, bacterial metabolites (postbiotics), fecal microbial transplantation, and carbon nanoparticles. FXR-agonists target both the gut and the liver and are currently being tested in different liver diseases. Finally, synthetic biotic medicines, phages that target specific bacteria or therapies that create physical barriers between the gut and the liver offer new approaches of treatment.Copyright © 2019 European Association for the Study of the Liver.

In Experiment 1, twenty goats were fed with an isonitrogenous diet, containing 28% Non-Fiber Carbohydrate (MNFC group,  = 10) or 14% NFC (LNFC group,  = 10). In the MNFC group, the ruminal concentration of Short Chain   () increased, and pH declined. Compared with those in the LNFC group, the microbial protein synthesis in rumen and mRNA abundance of urea transporter B (UT-B) in rumen epithelium increased in the MNFC group, although serum urea-N (SUN) did not differ significantly between groups. Simultaneously, urinal urea-N excretion was reduced in the MNFC group. Significant correlations were found between rumen  and UT-B and between UT-B and urinal urea-N excretion. Furthermore, the abundances of  receptor of GPR41 and GPR43 increased in the rumen epithelium of the MNFC group. These results suggest that increases of SUN transported into the rumen and incorporated into microbial protein and decreases of urinal urea-N excretion are related to ruminal . This is supported by data from our previous study in which added  on the mucosal side caused increases of urea transport rate (flux J urea) from the blood to the ruminal lumen side. In Experiment 2, we used 16S rRNA Amplicon Sequencing to analyze the structure of the ruminal microbiota community in relation to . An additional eight goats were assigned into the MNFC ( = 4) and LNFC ( = 4) groups. The dietary ingredients, chemical composition, and feeding regimes were the same as those in Experiment 1. Constrained correspondence analysis (CCA analysis) revealed NFC promoted the expansion of microbiota diversity, particularly of -producing microbes. The function prediction of 19 upregulated Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) ortholog groups showed an NFC-induced increase of the types and abundances of genes coding for enzymes catalyzing N and  acid metabolism. Based on our present and previous investigations, our results indicate that, in goats consuming a MNFC diet, the facilitated urea transport in the rumen and improved urea N salvage are triggered by an expansion of ruminal microbiota diversity and are signaled by ruminal . This study thus provides new insights into the microbiota involved in the dietary modulation of urea-N salvage in ruminant animals.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31591345>The Role of Dietary Fiber in Rheumatoid Arthritis Patients: A Feasibility Study.</a></h2><p>Short-chain   are microbial metabolites that have been shown to be key regulators of the gut-joint axis in animal models. In humans, microbial dysbiosis was observed in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients as well as in those at-risk to develop RA, and is thought to be an environmental trigger for the development of clinical disease. At the same time, diet has a proven impact on maintaining intestinal microbial homeostasis. Given this association, we performed a feasibility study in RA patients using high-fiber dietary supplementation with the objective to restore microbial homeostasis and promote the secretion of beneficial immunomodulatory microbial metabolites. RA patients ( = 36) under routine care received daily high-fiber bars or cereals for 28 days. Clinical assessments and laboratory analysis of immune parameters in blood and stool samples from RA patients were done before and after the high-fiber dietary supplementation. We observed an increase in circulating regulatory T cell numbers, favorable Th1/Th17 ratios, as well as decreased markers of bone erosion in RA patients after 28 days of dietary intervention. Furthermore, patient-related outcomes of RA improved. Based on these results, we conclude that controlled clinical studies of high-fiber dietary interventions could be a viable approach to supplement or complement current pharmacological treatment strategies.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31689559>Abnormal Eating Patterns Cause Circadian Disruption and Promote Alcohol-Associated Colon Carcinogenesis.</a></h2><p>Alcohol intake with circadian rhythm disruption (CRD) increases colon cancer risk. We hypothesized that eating during or around physiologic rest time, a common habit in modern society, causes CRD and investigated the mechanisms by which it promotes alcohol-associated colon carcinogenesis.Effect of feeding time on CRD was assessed using B6 PER2::LUC mice. TS4Cre×APC mice were used to model colon polyposis and to assess the effects of feeding schedules, alcohol consumption, and prebiotic treatment on microbiota composition, short-chain--acid () levels, colon inflammation and cancer risk. The relationship between butyrate signaling and a proinflammatory profile was assessed by inactivating the butyrate receptor GPR109A.Eating at rest (Wrong-time eating: WTE) shifted the phase of the colon rhythm PER2::LUC mice. In TS4Cre×APC mice, a combination of WTE and alcohol exposure (WTE+Alcohol) decreased the levels of -producing bacteria and of butyrate, reduced colonic densities of Tregs, induced a proinflammatory profile, characterized by hyperpermeability and an elevated mucosal Th17/Treg ratio, and promoted CRC. Prebiotic treatment improved the mucosal inflammatory profile and attenuated inflammation and cancer. WTE+Alcohol-induced polyposis was associated with increased STAT3 expression. Decreased butyrate signaling activated epithelial STAT3 in vitro. The relationship between butyrate signaling and a proinflammatory profile was confirmed in human colorectal cancers using The Cancer Genome Atlas.Abnormal timing of food intake caused CRD and interacts with alcohol consumption to promote colon carcinogenesis by inducing a pro-tumorigenic inflammatory profile driven by changes in the colon microbiota and butyrate signaling.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

A key point to reduce production costs is the design a cell factory that combines the continuous production of drop-in fuel molecules with the ability to recover products from the cell culture at low cost. Medium-chain hydrocarbons seem ideal targets because they can be produced from abundant   and, due to their volatility, can be easily collected in gas phase. However, pathways used to produce hydrocarbons from   require two steps, low efficient enzymes and/or complex electron donors. Recently, a new hydrocarbon-forming route involving a single enzyme called  acid photodecarboxylase (FAP) was discovered in microalgae. Here, we show that in illuminated E. coli cultures coexpression of FAP and a medium-chain  acid thioesterase results in continuous release of  hydrocarbons. Maximum hydrocarbon productivity was reached under low/medium light while higher irradiance resulted in decreased amounts of FAP. It was also found that the production rate of hydrocarbons was constant for at least 5 days and that 30% of total hydrocarbons could be collected in the gas phase of the culture. This work thus demonstrates that the photochemistry of the FAP can be harnessed to design a simple cell factory that continuously produces hydrocarbons easy to recover and in pure form.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31595527>Effect of cinnamon essential oil on gut microbiota in the mouse model of dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis.</a></h2><p>Increasing evidence has confirmed that the antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory effects of cinnamon essential oil (CEO) contribute to protecting against inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis mice model was established to investigate the correlation between the protective effects of CEO and the regulation of intestinal microflora. IBD symptoms were assessed by measuring hemoglobin content, myeloperoxidase activity, histopathological observation, cytokines and TLR4 expression. The alteration of fecal microbiome composition was analyzed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Results indicated that oral administration of CEO enriched with cinnamaldehyde effectively alleviated the development of DSS-induced colitis. In contrast to the inability of antibiotics to regulate flora imbalance, the mice fed with CEO improved the diversity and richness of intestinal microbiota, and modified the community composition with a decrease in Helicobacter and Bacteroides and an increase in Bacteroidales_S24-7 family and -producing bacteria (Alloprevotella and Lachnospiraceae_NK4A136_group). Moreover, correlation analysis showed TLR4 and TNF-α was positively correlated with Helicobacter, but inversely correlated with -producing bacteria. These findings indicated from a new perspective that the inhibitory effect of CEO on IBD was closely related to improving the intestinal flora imbalance. This article is protected by copyright.

We selected studies that provided data on  levels or fecal microbiota abundance in obese and nonobese individuals and then combined the published estimates using a random-effects meta-analysis. Obese individuals had significantly higher fecal concentrations of acetate (SMD (standardized mean differences) = 0.87, 95% CI (confidence interva) = 0.24-1.50,  (-squared) = 88.5), propionate (SMD = 0.86, 95% CI = 0.35-1.36,  = 82.3%), and butyrate (SMD = 0.78, 95% CI = 0.29-1.27,  = 81.7%) than nonobese controls. The subgroup analyses showed no evidence of heterogeneity among obese individuals with a BMI >30 kg/m ( = 0.0%). At the phylum level, the abundance of fecal microbiota was reduced in obese compared to nonobese individuals, but the difference was not statistically significant (Bacteroidetes phylum, SMD = -0.36, 95% CI = -0.73-0.01; Firmicutes phylum, SMD = -0.10, 95% CI = -0.31-0.10). The currently available human case-control studies show that obesity is associated with high levels of  but not gut microbiota richness at the phylum level.

The up-flow MFC was operated for 202 days, obtaining an average power density of 0.13 W/m, and Tepidiphilus was the dominant transcriptionally-active microorganisms. The planktonic community developed in the up-flow MFC was used to inoculate a flow-through MFC resulting in the proliferation of Ureibacillus, whose relative abundance increased from 1 to 61% after 45 days. Despite the differences between the up-flow and flow-through MFCs, including the anode electrode, hydrodynamic conditions, and the predominant microorganism, similar (p = 0.05) volumetric power (0.11-0.13 W/m), coulombic efficiency (16-18%) and acetate consumption rates (55-69 mg/L/d) were obtained from both.

However, it is unclear for the reduction mechanisms of Cr(VI) in an anaerobic hydrogen fermenter, such as reduction kinetics, related electron donors, migration and transformation, reduction site and key components, and related microorganisms. To clarify these issues, a hydrogen fermenter was designed to reduce Cr(VI) at 55 °C with glucose as initial substrate. Results show that 100 mg/L Cr(VI) can be completely reduced (99.5%) to trivalent chromium (Cr(III) through chemical and biological reactions. Bio-reduction dominates Cr(VI) removal in a first-order exponential decay mode with both glucose and its metabolites () as electron donors. Moreover,  are more suitable as electron donors for Cr(VI) bio-reduction than glucose. Bacilli, Clostridia and Thermotogae in the fermenter dominated the reduction of Cr(VI) by regulating the production and composition of extracellular polymers (EPSs), in which carboxyl and hydroxyl groups play an important role for Cr(VI) reduction by coordination. The results can guide us to regulate the bio-reduction of Cr(VI), and provide reference for the development of bio-reduction technology of Cr(VI).Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

These oils have traditionally been studied using sugar-based feedstock, which implies high costs, substrate limitation, and high contamination risks. In this sense, low-cost carbon sources such as  (VFAs) are envisaged as promising building blocks for lipid biosynthesis to produce oil-based bioproducts. VFAs can be generated from a wide variety of organic wastes through anaerobic digestion and further converted into lipids by oleaginous yeasts (OYs) in a fermentation process. These microorganisms can accumulate in the form of lipid bodies, lipids of up to 60% wt/wt of their biomass. In this context, OY is a promising biotechnological tool for biofuel and bioproduct generation using low-cost VFA media as substrates. This review covers recent advances in microbial oil production from VFAs. Production of VFAs via anaerobic digestion processes and the involved metabolic pathways are reviewed.

We hypothesized that total fermentation but not the source (type) of FM would be the main factor in determining cellular /molecular outcomes in the healthy colon epithelia. The main aim of this study was to elucidate the role of two different sources of FM, fructooligosaccharides (FOS) and wheat bran (WB), on the expression of genes involved in short chain  acid () transport, G-protein signaling, apoptosis, cell proliferation and oncogenesis in colon epithelia of healthy rats. Male Fischer 344 rats (n = 10/group) were fed AIN-93G control (0% FM) or experimental diets containing WB (~1%, 2%, or 5% FM) or FOS (~2%, 5%, or 8% FM). Rats were killed after 6 weeks and the colon mucosa was assessed for the expression of target genes using real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. By comparison to the control, dose-related changes of mRNA levels were found in rats fed FOS-based diets, including: (a) upregulation of three  transporters (Smct2, Mct1 and Mct4) but downregulation of Mct2, (b) upregulation of Gpr109a and downregulation of Gpr120, Gpr43, Gprc5a, Rgs2 and Rgs16, (c) upregulation of apoptosis-related genes including Bcl2, Bcl2-like 1, Bak1, Caspase 3, Caspase 8 and Caspase 9, (d) downregulation of the oncogenes and metastasis genes Ros1, Fos, Cd44, Fn1 and Plau, and (e) downregulation of several genes involved in cellular proliferation including Hbegf, Hoxb13, Cgref1, Wfdc1, Tgm3, Fgf7, Nov and Lumican. In contrast, rats fed WB-based diets resulted in dose-related upregulation of mRNA levels of Smct2, Rgs16, Gprc5a, Gpr109a, Bcl2-like 1, Caspase 8, and Fos. Additionally, different gene expression responses were observed in rats fed FOS and WB at 2% and 5% FM. Over all, these gene changes elicited by FOS and WB were independent of the expression of the tumor suppressor Tp53.

The thermosets and composites with unsaturated double bonds curing system are especially concerned due to their versatility. To further exploit such resins, reactive diluents (RDs) with unsaturated sites are usually incorporated to improve their processability and mechanical properties. Traditional RD, styrene, is a toxic  organic compound and one of the anticipated carcinogens warned by the National Institute of Health, USA.

The average specific methane productions of 0.18 L/g VS and 0.17 L/g VS were achieved without biochar at the organic loading rate (OLR) of 3.125 and 6.25 g VS/L/d, respectively. An increase of 12% in methane production was obtained in the presence of biochar at the two operational OLRs. Accumulation of propionic acid was observed associating with AD of DCM, which was substantially alleviated by biochar supplement. The buffer capacity of biochar was supposed to develop through strengthening the buffer system established by NH and . Methanosarcina that can utilize multiple nutrients for methanogenesis was the dominant archaea in the presence of biochar, while the strictly aceticlastic Methanosaeta was dominant in control digester. These results suggest that biochar enhanced methanogenesis through intensifying its available pathway.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The affecting parameters such as IL content, VFA concentration, and the initial pH of the feed solution as well as the type and concentration of the stripping solution were investigated. PIMs performed a much higher selective separation performance toward hexanoic acid. The optimal PIM composed of 60 wt% quaternary ammonium IL with the permeability coefficients for acetic and hexanoic acid of 0.72 and 4.38 µm s, respectively, was determined. The purity of hexanoic acid obtained in the stripping solution increased with an increase in the VFA concentration of the feed solution and decreasing HCl concentration of the stripping solution. The use of NaCO as the stripping solution and the involvement of the electrodialysis process could dramatically enhance the transport efficiency of both VFAs, but the separation efficiency decreased sharply. Furthermore, a coordinating mechanism containing hydrogen bonding and ion exchange for VFA transport was demonstrated. The highest purity of hexanoic acid (89.3%) in the stripping solution demonstrated that this PIM technology has good prospects for the separation and recovery of VFAs from aqueous solutions.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31533283>Sensory Metabolite Profiling in a Date Pit Based Coffee Substitute and in Response to Roasting as Analyzed via Mass Spectrometry Based Metabolomics.</a></h2><p>Interest in developing coffee substitutes is on the rise, to minimizing its health side effects. In the Middle East, date palm ( L.) pits are often used as a coffee substitute post roasting. In this study, commercially-roasted date pit products, along with unroasted and home-prepared roasted date pits, were subjected to analyses for their metabolite composition, and neuropharmacological evaluation in mice. Headspace SPME-GCMS and GCMS post silylation were employed for characterizing its  and non- metabolite profile. For comparison to roasted coffee, coffee product was also included. There is evidence that some commercial date pit products appear to contain undeclared additives. SPME headspace analysis revealed the abundance of furans, pyrans, terpenoids and sulfur compounds in roasted date pits, whereas pyrroles and caffeine were absent. GCMS-post silylation employed for primary metabolite profiling revealed  ' enrichment in roasted pits versus sugars' abundance in coffee. Biological investigations affirmed that date pit showed safer margin than coffee from its LD, albeit it exhibits no CNS stimulant properties. This study provides the first insight into the roasting impact on the date pit through its metabolome and its neuropharmacological aspects to rationalize its use as a coffee substitute.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31416003>Novel unfiltered beer-based marinades to improve the nutritional quality, safety, and sensory perception of grilled ruminant meats.</a></h2><p>Ruminant meat is considered an excellent source of proteins, dietary   and essential minerals. Grilling is a popular cooking method; however, the high temperatures employ could modify the grilled meat quality and safety. In this study, the effects of novel beer-based marinades infused with herbs and spices on the quality, safety, and sensory perception of grilled beef and moose meat is examined. Unmarinated meat showed high content of  lipid oxidation and Maillard reaction products compared to the marinated samples, which contained higher number and abundance of terpenes and sulfur based compounds. Strong relationships between Maillard products and heterocyclic amines formation, as well as between  terpenes and the lipophilic antioxidant activity, were observed in the grilled meats. The findings suggest the unfiltered beer-based marinades were effective in reducing lipid oxidation and Maillard reaction compounds formation, while improving the nutritional quality, safety and sensory preference of grilled ruminant meats.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

However, a lack of physical online sensors, the high price of the available online water-quality analyzers, and the need for regular maintenance and calibration prevent frequent use of online monitoring. Soft-sensors are viable alternatives, with advantages in terms of price and flexibility in operation. As an example, this work presents the development, tuning, implementation, and validation of an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) on a grey-box model to estimate the concentration of  (VFA), soluble phosphates (PO-P), ammonia nitrogen (NH-N) and nitrate nitrogen (NO-N) using simple and inexpensive sensors such as pH and dissolved oxygen (DO). The EKF is implemented in a sequential batch moving bed biofilm reactor (MBBR) pilot scale unit used for biological phosphorus removal from municipal wastewater. The grey-box model, used for soft sensing, was constructed by fitting the kinetic data from the pilot plant to a reduced order version of ASM2d model. The EKF is successfully validated against the standard laboratory measurements, which confirms its ability to estimate various states during the continuous operation of the pilot plant.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31685604>Ketone body receptor GPR43 regulates lipid metabolism under ketogenic conditions.</a></h2><p>Ketone bodies, including β-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate, are important alternative energy sources during energy shortage. β-Hydroxybutyrate also acts as a signaling molecule via specific G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs); however, the specific associated GPCRs and physiological functions of acetoacetate remain unknown. Here we identified acetoacetate as an endogenous agonist for short-chain  acid () receptor GPR43 by ligand screening in a heterologous expression system. Under ketogenic conditions, such as starvation and low-carbohydrate diets, plasma acetoacetate levels increased markedly, whereas plasma and cecal  levels decreased dramatically, along with an altered gut microbiota composition. In addition, -deficient mice showed reduced weight loss and suppressed plasma lipoprotein lipase activity during fasting and eucaloric ketogenic diet feeding. Moreover, -deficient mice exhibited minimal weight decrease after intermittent fasting. These observations provide insight into the role of ketone bodies in energy metabolism under shifts in nutrition and may contribute to the development of preventive medicine via diet and foods.Copyright © 2019 the Author(s).

The in vitro antioxidant activity of the ethyl acetate (EtOAc) and the n-BuOH extracts of this plant were also assayed. To investigate the antioxidant potential, extracts were tested for their capacity to scavenge 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH·) and to inhibit lipid peroxidation using the TBARs method. The contents of total phenolics and flavonoids were measured. Additionally, antiproliferative activity and DNA-damage inhibition of the n-BuOH extract was determined using XCELLigence RTCA instrument and photolyzing 46966 plasmid, respectively. The results exhibited that the scavenging abilities of the EtOAc extract were better than the n-BuOH extract with an IC50= 11.59 µg/mL and 16.67 µg/mL for both extracts, respectively. The phenolic and flavonoid contents were found higher in the n-BuOH and EtOAc extracts. Furthermore, our results showed that n-BuOH extract exhibited a remarkable inhibition of lipid peroxidation with an IC50 of 340.94±7.49 μg/mL and had an antiproliferative effect against Hela cells. Extracts of C. sphaerocephala showed antioxidant activity on scavenging DPPH·.

An in vitro model could be useful to predict the rate fibers are fermented once they reach the colon. Pet food companies are constantly searching for new ingredients to differentiate their products from competitors. Miscanthus grass (MG), pea fiber (PF), and sorghum bran (SB) are novel fiber sources that could be alternatives to standards like cellulose (CE) and beet pulp (BP). The objectives of the study were to determine the effects of fiber source on organic matter disappearance (OMD), estimated organic matter disappearance (EOMD), and fermentation end-product concentrations using an in vitro fermentation procedure and dog fecal inoculum. Total dietary fiber (TDF) residues from MG, CE, BP, PF, and SB were fermented in vitro with buffered dog feces. Fecal samples were collected and maintained in anaerobic conditions until the dilution and inoculation. Test tubes containing the fibrous substrates were incubated for 4, 8, and 12 h at 39 °C. Short-chain   (), branched-chain   (BCFA), OMD, and EOMD were determined for each fiber source and time point. Beet pulp had the highest OMD, EOMD, and  production of all tested fiber sources (38.6% OMD, 26.2% EOMD, 2.72 mmol /g of substrate). Sorghum bran led to greater concentrations of BCFA (59.86 µmol/g of substrate) and intermediate OMD and EOMD compared to the other tested fibers. Cellulose and MG were poorly fermented with the lowest OMD, EOMD, , and BCFA compared to other fibers. In conclusion, MG could be used as an insoluble minimally fermentable replacement fiber for CE in dog foods.© The Author(s) 2019.

The aim of this study was to identify the effect of a short-term diet high in sugar on susceptibility to colitis. Adult wild-type mice were placed on chow or a high sugar diet (50% sucrose) ± acetate. After two days of diet, mice were treated with dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) to induce colitis. Disease severity was assessed daily. Colonic tissues were analyzed for cytokine expression using the MesoScale discovery platform. Intestinal dextran permeability and serum lipopolysaccharide levels (LPS) were measured. Gut microbiota were analyzed by 16s rRNA sequencing and short chain  acid () concentrations by gas chromatography. Bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) were incubated with LPS and cytokine secretion measured. Mice on a high sugar diet had increased gut permeability, decreased microbial diversity and reduced . BMDM derived from high sugar fed mice were highly responsive to LPS. High sugar fed mice had increased susceptibility to colitis and pro-inflammatory cytokine concentrations. Oral acetate significantly attenuated colitis in mice by restoring permeability. In conclusion, short term exposure to a high sugar diet increases susceptibility to colitis by reducing short-chain   and increasing gut permeability.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31581791>Xylanase and xylo- oligosaccharide prebiotic improve the growth performance and concentration of potentially prebiotic oligosaccharides in the ileum of broiler chickens.</a></h2><p>1. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of supplementing broiler diets with xylanase or xylo- oligosaccharide (XOS) on growth performance, the concentration of non-starch polysaccharide (NSP) hydrolysis products in the ileum and concentration of short chain   () in the caeca of broiler chickens.2. In total, 500 male Ross 308 broilers were used in this 29-day (d) study. The treatments were organised into a 2 × 2 plus 1 factorial arrangement consisting of two additives (xylanase or XOS) at two levels (low or high) plus a control treatment with no additives. This gave five treatments with 100 birds in each treatment group. The diets were slightly deficient in protein by 20 g/kg and energy by 1 MJ/kg.3. On d 14 and 28, two birds per pen were euthanised, the caeca content collected and analysed for short chain  acid () concentration. On d 29, six birds per pen were euthanised and ileal digesta were collected and analysed for the concentration of NSP fractions.4. On d 14, caecal acetic acid, iso-butyric acid, iso-valeric acid, n-valeric acid and total  concentrations were significantly greater (P ≤ 0.05) when diets were supplemented with XOS compared with xylanase.5. Ileal concentration of arabinose, galactose and glucuronic acid (GlucA2) were significantly greater (P ≤ 0.05) in the insoluble NSP fraction when diets were supplemented with a high level of xylanase, compared with the control treatment. Ileal concentration of fructose was significantly greater (P ≤ 0.05) in the water soluble NSP when a high level of xylanase or low level of XOS were included in the diet compared with the control.6. It was concluded that xylanase and XOS had similar effects on NSP concentration and  in the caeca, although there was little effect on performance. This observation demonstrated further benefits of xylanase supplementation in wheat-based broiler diets beyond digesta viscosity reduction and the release of extra nutrients.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31562378>Intestinal inflammation increases convulsant activity and reduces antiepileptic drug efficacy in a mouse model of epilepsy.</a></h2><p>We studied the effects of intestinal inflammation on pentylenetetrazole (PTZ)-induced seizures in mice and the effects thereon of some antiepileptic and anti-inflammatory treatments to establish if a link may exist. The agents tested were: alpha-lactoalbumin (ALAC), a whey protein rich in tryptophan, effective in some animal models of epilepsy and on colon/intestine inflammation, valproic acid (VPA), an effective antiepileptic drug in this seizure model, mesalazine (MSZ) an effective aminosalicylate anti-inflammatory treatment against ulcerative colitis and sodium butyrate (NaB), a short chain  acid () normally produced in the intestine by gut microbiota, important in maintaining gut health and reducing gut inflammation and oxidative stress. Intestinal inflammation was induced by dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) administration for 6 days. Drug treatment was started on day 3 and lasted 11 days, when seizure susceptibility to PTZ was measured along with intestinal inflammatory markers (i.e. NF-κB, Iκ-Bα, COX-2, iNOS), histological damage, disease activity index (DAI) and  concentration in stools. DSS-induced colitis increased seizure susceptibility and while all treatments were able to reduce intestinal inflammation, only ALAC and NaB exhibited significant antiepileptic properties in mice with induced colitis, while they were ineffective as antiepileptics at the same doses in control mice without colitis. Interestingly, in DSS-treated mice, VPA lost part of its antiepileptic efficacy in comparison to preventing seizures in non-DSS-treated mice while MSZ remained ineffective in both groups. Our study demonstrates that reducing intestinal inflammation through ALAC or NaB administration has specific anticonvulsant effects in PTZ-treated mice. Furthermore, it appears that intestinal inflammation may reduce the antiepileptic effects of VPA, although we confirm that it decreases seizure threshold in this group. Therefore, we suggest that intestinal inflammation may represent a valid antiepileptic target which should also be considered as a participating factor to seizure incidence in susceptible patients and also could be relevant in reducing standard antiepileptic drug efficacy.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31620454>Conversion of Branched-Chain Amino  to Corresponding Isoacids - An  Tool for Estimating Ruminal Protein Degradability.</a></h2><p>In this paper we describe a study that evaluates the applicability of an  fermentation model to assess the resistance of protein supplements to rumen degradation. The protein sources used were: soybean meal (SBM); whey protein (WHEY), which was expected to be rapidly degraded, and yeast-derived microbial protein (YMP), which was proposed to be resistant to rumen degradation. The basal diet was composed of grass silage and a commercial compound feed. The protein supplements were added at three isonitrogenous doses. Fermentation was monitored for 24 h and gas production, , lactic acid, and ammonia were analyzed at three timepoints. Protein degradation was estimated by determining the extent to which branched-chain amino  (BCAA) introduced with the protein supplement were converted to corresponding branched-chain  (BCVFA). At the highest dose of WHEY, 60% of introduced valine, leucine, and isoleucine was recovered as isobutyric, 2-methylbutyric, and isovaleric acid (products of BCAA decarboxylation and deamination), respectively. The BCVFA detected represented 50% of added BCAA with SBM, but <15% with YMP. Further indications that YMP protein is resistant to degradation were provided by analysis of ammonia. With YMP, the residual ammonia concentration only marginally exceeded that of the cultures with no protein supplementation, while it increased dose-dependently when the vessels were supplemented with WHEY or SBM. This suggests that with WHEY and SBM, the rate of deamination exceeded the rate of ammonia assimilation by bacteria. Residual ammonia and BCVFA, the two indicators of protein fermentation, were strongly correlated. Overall bacterial activity was monitored as yield of gas, , and bacteria. These three correlating parameters showed that WHEY only modestly stimulated fermentation, whereas SBM and YMP stimulated fermentation extensively, possibly owing to their higher carbohydrate content. The results presented suggest that the  fermentation method was suitable for detecting differences in resistance of protein supplements to rumen degradation and following a full method validation could be a useful tool for diet formulation. The data obtained suggested that YMP was the most resistant and WHEY the most susceptible to degradation.Copyright © 2019 Apajalahti, Vienola, Raatikainen, Holder and Moran.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31681339>Chemical Composition of Mango ( L.) Fruit: Nutritional and Phytochemical Compounds.</a></h2><p>Mango fruit has a high nutritional value and health benefits due to important components. The present manuscript is a comprehensive update on the composition of mango fruit, including nutritional and phytochemical compounds, and the changes of these during development and postharvest. Mango components can be grouped into macronutrients (carbohydrates, proteins, amino , lipids, , and organic ), micronutrients (vitamins and minerals), and phytochemicals (phenolic, polyphenol, pigments, and  constituents). Mango fruit also contains structural carbohydrates such as pectins and cellulose. The major amino  include lysine, leucine, cysteine, valine, arginine, phenylalanine, and methionine. The lipid composition increases during ripening, particularly the omega-3 and omega-6  . The most important pigments of mango fruit include chlorophylls ( and ) and carotenoids. The most important organic  include malic and citric , and they confer the fruit acidity. The  constituents are a heterogeneous group with different chemical functions that contribute to the aromatic profile of the fruit. During development and maturity stages occur important biochemical, physiological, and structural changes affecting mainly the nutritional and phytochemical composition, producing softening, and modifying aroma, flavor, and antioxidant capacity. In addition, postharvest handling practices influence total content of carotenoids, phenolic compounds, vitamin C, antioxidant capacity, and organoleptic properties.Copyright © 2019 Maldonado-Celis, Yahia, Bedoya, Landázuri, Loango, Aguillón, Restrepo and Guerrero Ospina.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31487531>Butyrate mediated regulation of RNA binding proteins in the post-transcriptional regulation of inflammatory gene expression.</a></h2><p>Short chain   (SCFAs) are produced by commensal bacteria in the gut and are known to reduce inflammation through transcriptional inhibition of cytokines and inflammatory proteins such as cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). Butyrate is a  that was reported to alter the mRNA stability of inflammatory genes by increasiing the expression of the RNA binding protein (RBP) Tristetraprolin (TTP). We have hypothesized that butyrate may regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally through global effects on the expression or cytoplasmic translocation of RBPs. Using bioinformatics analyses of publicly available microarray data as well as colon cancer cell lines treated with sodium butyrate, we have observed that butyrate treatment led to a general reduction in expression of several (but not all) RBPs and inhibition in the cytosolic translocation of HuR, a well-known stabilizing RBP. This was reflected in reduced NanoLuc reporter activity of several different AU-rich element (ARE) sequences in the presence of butyrate; this suppression was retained even when HuR was overexpressed. Mechanistically, we have shown that reduced activity of HuR was related to decreased phosphorylation of p38 and MK2 and enhanced phosphorylation of Chk2. As a proof of concept, we show butyrate-mediated inhibition in binding of HuR to the 3'UTR of COX-2 mRNA resulting in reduced mRNA and protein levels of the inflammatory gene. Overall, our data suggest that butyrate can reduce the expression of inflammatory genes not only by transcriptional regulation, but also by post-transcriptional regulation via inhibition of mRNA stabilizing proteins.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Early-life iron deficiency may alter the developing microbiota, which may or may not be reversible with subsequent dietary iron repletion. Thus, the aim of this study was to determine whether early-life iron deficiency and subsequent repletion alter colonic microbial composition and fermentation end-product concentrations in pigs.  Forty-two male pigs received either control (CONT, 21.3 mg Fe/L) or iron-deficient (ID, 2.72 mg Fe/L) milk replacer treatments from postnatal day (PND) 2 to 32. Subsequently, 20 pigs continued through a series of age-appropriate, iron-adequate diets from PND 33 to 61. Contents from the ascending colon (AC) and rectum (feces) were collected at PND 32 and/or 61. Assessments included microbiota composition by 16S rRNA sequencing and   acid (VFA) concentrations by gas chromatography methods. Data were analyzed using a 1-way ANOVA and PERMANOVA to assess the main effects of early-life iron status on all outcomes.  In AC samples, 15 genera differed ( < 0.05) between ID and CONT pigs, while 27 genera differed ( < 0.05) in fecal samples at PND 32. Early-life ID pigs had higher ( = 0.012) relative abundance of  in AC samples compared with CONT pigs. In feces, ID pigs had lower ( < 0.05) relative abundances of  and  from the families of Clostridiaceae, Lachnospiraceae, and Ruminococcaceae.

Beta diversity differed at PND 32 in both AC and feces between CONT and ID pigs but no differences remained at PND 61. At PND 32, the total VFA concentration was higher in ID pigs compared with CONT pigs in both AC ( = 0.003) and feces ( = 0.001), but no differences in VFA concentrations persisted to PND 61.

Commonly known as a kind of constituent macromolecules, non-digestible polysaccharides have always been fermented by the intestinal microbiota. Nostoc commune Vaucher (N. commune) has always been appreciated as a healthy food and supplementation worldwide as it is rich in nutrients. Particularly, polysaccharides account for 60% of the dry weight of N. commune. In this study, we examined the protective effects of the polysaccharides isolated from N. commune (NVPS) against colitis-associated colon tumorigenesis in mice treated with azoxymethane (AOM) and dextran sulfate sodium salt (DSS) and the impact of these polysaccharides on the intestinal microbiota. NVPS were administered to mice through an intragastric gavage for 14 weeks. Our results demonstrated that the treatment with NVPS significantly decreased the number and sizes of tumors and reduced the incidence of intestinal tumors. Using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and qPCR, we analyzed the bacterial composition of the fecal samples obtained from mice. The results demonstrated that the alterations in the abundance of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes caused by the AOM/DSS treatment were significantly reversed in response to the NVPS treatment. Moreover, the short-chain  acid ()-producing genera, including butyric acid-producing genera (Butyricicoccus, Butyrivibrio and Butyricimonas) and acetic acid-producing genera (Lachnospiraceae UCG 001, Lachnospiraceae UCG 006, and Blautia), were drastically enriched following the NVPS intervention. These compositional alterations induced by the NVPS were associated with the suppressed colonic inflammation and carcinogenesis. In conclusion, our results demonstrated an appreciable capability of NVPS to restore the gut microbiota profile altered by AOM/DSS, indicating the potential of NVPS as a promising prebiotic candidate for the prevention and treatment of colorectal cancer.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31541792>Intermittent micro-aeration: New strategy to control   acid accumulation in high organic loading anaerobic digestion.</a></h2><p>This study developed an intermittent oxidation-reduction potential (ORP)-controlled micro-aeration system for high solids anaerobic digestion (AD) of lignocellulosic biomass without  (VFA) accumulation at high organic loading rate (OLR). Traditional AD of Napier grass, a model lignocellulosic biomass, at an OLR of 5 g  solids (VS)/L/day resulted in an accumulation of total VFA concentration up to 9.2 g/L as acetic acid (HAc) equivalent, causing rapid drops in pH and methane yield, and driving the digester to the verge of failure. Once intermittent (every 24 h) ORP-controlled micro-aeration (at ORP of -470 mV) was initiated, the total VFA concentration rapidly decreased to 3.0 g HAc/L and the methane yield improved, resulting in stable digester performance without the need for alkalinity supplementation or OLR reduction. By combining reactor performance results, mass balance analyses, microbial community characterization data, and a bioenergetic evaluation, this study suggested that rapid VFA conversion and CH production were carried out by facultative anaerobes and hydrogenotrophic methanogens under micro-aerobic conditions. This novel operating approach can be applied as an effective control strategy for high OLR AD processes especially in the event of VFA accumulation.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

A Platform to Establish Madeira Wine Aroma Descriptors.</a></h2><p>In the present study we aimed to investigate the  organic compounds (VOCs) that may potentially be responsible for specific descriptors of Madeira wine providing details about Madeira wine aroma notes at molecular level. Moreover, the wine aroma profile, based on the obtained data, will be a starting point to evaluate the impact of grape variety (Malvasia, Bual, Sercial, Verdelho and Tinta Negra), type (sweet, medium sweet, dry and medium dry), and age (from 3 to 20 years old) on Madeira wine sensorial properties. Firstly, a comprehensive and in-depth Madeira wine  profiling was carried out using headspace solid-phase microextraction combined with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (HS-SPME/GC-qMS). Secondly, a relation among the varietal, fermentative and aging aroma compounds, and their aroma descriptors with the Madeira wine sensorial properties was assessed. A total of 82 VOCs, belonging to different chemical families were identified, namely 21 esters, 13 higher alcohols, ten terpenic compounds, nine  , seven furanic compounds, seven norisoprenoids, six lactones, four acetals, four  phenols and one sulphur compound. From a sensorial point of view, during the aging process the wine lost its freshness and fruitiness odor related to the presence of some varietal and fermentative compounds, whereas other descriptors such as caramel, dried fruits, spicy, toasty and woody, arose during ageing. The Maillard reaction and diffusion from the oak were the most important pathways related with these descriptors. A relationship-based approach was used to explore the impact of grape variety, wine type, and age on Madeira wine sensorial properties based on shared number of VOCs and their odors.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31627109>The role of a newly isolated strain Corynebacterium pollutisoli SPH6 in waste activated sludge alkaline fermentation.</a></h2><p>Alkaline fermentation has been considered as one of the efficient methods for waste activated sludge (WAS) treatment, but usually limited by microbial fermentation activities under extreme pH condition. One newly isolated alkali-tolerant strain Corynebacterium pollutisoli SPH6 was used to assess its potential role and effect on WAS alkaline fermentation process. Results from response surface method showed that the optimal organic nitrogen degradation rate by SPH6 was obtained under temperature of 35 °C, initial pH of 10, shaking speed of 80 rpm, inoculation ratio of 6.5%. Batch-scale experiments demonstrated that, compared with the control group, the inoculation of SPH6 finally achieved higher productions with 13.4% of carbohydrates, 27.1% of protein and 25.4% of total  (VFAs), and more predominant functional bacteria characterized by high-throughput sequencing, such as genera Acinetobacter in phylum Proteobacteria, Tissierella and Acetoanaerobium in phylum Firmicutes. The strain SPH6 might play a vital role in maintaining and facilitating the growth and diversity of functional bacteria in WAS alkaline fermentation process.

This study evaluated the impact of a yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and microalgae (Aurantiochytrium limacinum) supplementation on caecal, colonic and faecal microbial ecosystem and on blood inflammatory parameters of horses fed high-fibre or high-starch diets. Six fistulated geldings in a 2×2 Latin-square design were alternatively supplemented and received during each period 100% hay (4 weeks) followed by a 56/44 hay/barley diet (3 weeks). Caecal, colonic and faecal samples were collected 4h after the morning meal three times per diet, at 5-day intervals, to measure bacterial richness, diversity, and composition and microbial end-products. Blood was simultaneously collected for measuring inflammatory markers. The starchy diet clearly modified the microbial ecosystem in the three digestive segments, with an increase of the amylolytic function and a decrease of the fibrolytic one. However no effect of the diet was observed on the blood parameters. When horses were supplemented, no significant change was found in lipopolysaccharides, Prostaglandin-E2, Serum Amyloid A concentrations and complete blood count neither in cellulose-utilising, starch-utilising and lactate-utilising bacteria concentrations nor in the  and lactate concentrations and pH. Under supplementation, relative abundance of Family XIII Clostridiales increased in caecum and faeces irrespective of diet, and relative abundance of Veillonellaceae was higher during hay/barley diet in colon and faeces. Most variations of faecal bacterial taxa under supplementation were not observed in the hindgut. However, all variations suggested that supplementation could increase the fibrolytic function whatever the diet, and limit dysbiosis when horses' diet changed from high-fibre to high-starch.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31414382>Enterocin M and Sage Supplementation in Post-weaning Rabbits: Effects on Growth Performance, Caecal Microbiota, Fermentation and Enzymatic Activity.</a></h2><p>The effects of enterocin (Ent) M and sage extract applied separately and in combination were investigated. EntM (E 50 μL/animal/day in water) and sage extract (S 10 μL/animal/day in water) were applied individually and in combination (E+S) to rabbits during 21 days of treatment. The rabbits' growth was not significantly influenced by the additives. Lower feed conversion (FC) was noted in the experimental groups compared with controls, with the lowest data detected in E. The antimicrobial activity of EntM was noted (in E+S: lactic acid bacteria-P < 0.01; in E, E+S: enterococci, enterobacteria-P > 0.05; in E: clostridia-P > 0.05). The most significant changes in fermentation between weaned and older rabbits were noted in amylolytic activity at day 21 (E P < 0.05; E + S P < 0.05); prolonged reduction effect of sage extract on amylolytic activity was observed. The activity of cellulase, pectinase and xylanase was higher in older than in younger animals. Decrease in lactic acid and  was noted during EntM administration, with significant effect on propionic acid concentration (E P < 0.05; E+S P < 0.001). The sage extract reduced propionic acid (S P < 0.001) and butyric acid levels (S P < 0.05) and increased the concentrations of butyric, iso-valeric, valeric, caproic  and lactic acid (P < 0.001). It seems to be that EntM and sage supplementation may improve the economy of rabbit farms (increased FC) and the health status of rabbits (reduction of spoilage microbiota, enhanced enzymatic activities in caecum).</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31408740>Comparative study on metabolic changes of Aspergillus oryzae isolated from fermented foods according to culture conditions.</a></h2><p>Aspergillus oryzae is an important microbial starter for making diverse fermented foods due to its high hydrolytic enzyme activities. In this study, two strains of A. oryzae (AOB/AOK) with different activities of hydrolytic enzymes, such as α-amylase, protease and lipase, were cultured under various conditions of temperature, fermentation time, and initial pH. Comparative mass spectrometry (MS) based metabolomic analysis was performed to obtain primary metabolites and secondary  metabolite data sets. In the results of partial least square-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA),   and  metabolites derived from   and amino  mainly contributed to AOK with higher protease and lipase activities, whereas carbohydrate-derived volatiles, sugars and sugar alcohols were related to main metabolites of AOB with higher α-amylase activity. The temperature and initial pH were critical factors for the generation of primary metabolites and secondary  metabolites, such as organic ,  -derived volatiles, and some amino , in both A. oryzae strains. This study demonstrated that the specific culture conditions were closely linked to the formation of primary metabolites and secondary  metabolites of A. oryzae.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Sludge pretreatments have been previously used in hydrogen production; however, information about how they can affect VFAs production from microalgae is still lacking. Thermal pretreatment was studied at: (i) 80 °C for 10 and 30 min; (ii) 120 °C for 10 and 30 min; and (iii) 100 °C for 20 min. 2-bromoethanesulfonate (BES) at 10 mM and 30 mM was used as chemical pretreatment. Besides, a combination of both pretreatment methods (80 °C and 120 °C at 10 mM and 30 mM BES) was also tested. Thermal pretreatment increased organic matter conversions into VFAs (up to 71% COD-VFAs/COD) when compared to control values (40% in the untreated anaerobic sludge). Acetic acid was the most abundant VFAs at high temperatures (120 °C) and when BES was employed (up to 60% and 40%, respectively, in terms of COD). On the other hand, propionic acid was the most abundant product at low temperatures and in the untreated anaerobic sludge (up to 60% in terms of COD). This research work might set guidelines in order to choose a suitable sludge pretreatment for VFAs production from microalgae.Copyright © 2019.

In this study, two recyclable gels (sodium alginate/Ca/fiber:  hydrogels; cellulose nanofiber/chitosan: CNFCS aerogels) were successfully fabricated using the facile method. Additionally, the as-prepared adsorbents were investigated using a series of characterizations. The adsorption behavior and anti-interference performance of the synthesized gels were compared by choosing methylene blue (MB) as the model pollutant. The kinetic behavior of the gels towards MB was consistent with the pseudo first-order model, and the  hydrogels reached adsorption equilibrium faster than the CNFCS aerogels. The maximum adsorption capacity of MB on the  hydrogels and CNFCS aerogels was 1335.0 and 164.5 mg g (pH = 7.0, dosage: 0.5 g/L; initial concentration from 15 to 180 mg L), respectively. More specifically, we found that the co-existing anions had different effects on MB adsorption over the gels used for MB removal. Furthermore, for the  hydrogels, co-existing natural organic matter (NOM) at low concentrations enhanced MB adsorption, and then stabilized as the concentration of NOM increased. However, this increasing trend was not observed for MB adsorption on CNFCS aerogels; these gels exhibited a slight decrease at first, and then showed no change. Nevertheless, both the gels exhibited superior regeneration and recycling abilities.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Eighteen three-month-old Santa Ines castrated male lambs (16.9 ± 1.43 kg of body weight) were randomly distributed in two experimental treatments: Infected with T. colubriformis (I, n = 9) and Uninfected (U, n = 9). The I lambs received a total of 45,000 L larvae of T. colubriformis (5,000 infective larvae, three times per week for three weeks). Daily feed intake was assessed using the I lambs as a reference for their respective pairs on the U group (pair-fed). Weight, body condition score and faeces (stool) samples were obtained every 15 days for 75 days. In both treatments, faecal egg count (FEC), digesta passage rate, rumen fermentation parameters, protozoa count and short chain   () were evaluated. The lambs presented moderate infection (FEC = 620). The retention time of the digesta in the rumen-reticulum segment was lower (P < 0.05) in I lambs. The I lambs presented no inappetence, however, lower concentrations of total  and butyrate, while higher acetate concentration were observed in these lambs (P < 0.05). The present findings highlight that T. colubriformis infection decreased the retention time (solid and liquid content) of the digesta in the rumen-reticulum, as well as negatively affected lamb growth.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The host's genetic background, including the different isoforms of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene, can exert an influence over microbiota composition. Exposure to the widely-used pesticide chlorpyrifos (CPF), can lead to dysbiosis and alter the levels of metabolites produced by the microbiota, such as short-chain   (SCFAs). This study was aimed at assessing the contribution of the APOE genotype and early exposure to CPF on gut microbiota and  in brain. For it, C57BL/6, apoE3-and apoE4-TR mice were orally exposed to CPF from postnatal day (PND) 10 to PND 15. Microbiota in the gut and  in the brain were assessed at PND 15 after CPF exposure. Differences between genotypes at different taxonomic levels were found, A. muciniphila presented greater abundance in APOE4 genotype, but was reduced by CPF exposure. APOE and CPF influenced cerebral SCFAs, with APOE3 genotype showing the highest levels of acetic, propionic and butyric  and CPF exposure inducing the highest levels of isovaleric and 4-methylvaleric .

The protein and vitamin content, as well as essential  , gives them an appropriate composition to complete the nutritional requirements. However, meat constituents are susceptible to degradation processes. Among them, the most important, after microbial deterioration, are oxidative processes, which affect lipids, pigments, proteins and vitamins. During these reactions a sensory degradation of the product occurs, causing consumer rejection. In addition, there is a nutritional loss that leads to the formation of toxic substances, so the control of oxidative processes is of vital importance for the meat industry. Nonetheless, despite lipid oxidation being widely investigated for decades, the complex reactions involved in the process, as well as the different pathways and factors that influenced them, make that lipid oxidation mechanisms have not yet been completely understood. Thus, this article reviews the fundamental mechanisms of lipid oxidation, the most important oxidative reactions, the main factors that influence lipid oxidation, and the routine methods to measure compounds derived from lipid oxidation in meat.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31616670>Colonic Microbiota and Metabolites Response to Different Dietary Protein Sources in a Piglet Model.</a></h2><p>Dietary protein sources have the potential to affect the colon microbiome of piglets that will subsequently have a large impact on metabolic capabilities and hindgut health. This study explored the effects of different protein sources on the growth performance, diarrhea rate, apparent ileal digestibility (AID) of crude protein (CP), colonic mucin chemotypes, colonic microbiome, and microbial metabolites of piglets. Twenty-four piglets were randomly divided into four groups that received isoenergetic and isonitrogenous diets containing either Palbio 50 RD (P50), Soyppt-50% (S50), concentrated degossypolized cottonseed protein (CDCP), or fish meal (FM) as the sole protein source. The experimental diets did not affect the estimated daily gain (EDG), but P50 increased fecal score compared with S50 and CDCP. CDCP increased, but P50 reduced AID of CP in comparison to FM and S50. S50 and CDCP increased the amount of mixed neutral-acidic mucins relative to P50. Venn analysis identified unique OTUs in the P50 (13), CDCP (74), FM (39), and S50 (31) groups. The protein sources did not change the colonic bacterial richness or diversity. High  abundance in the P50 and FM, great abundant of  in the CDCP, and high  abundance in the S50 were found. The CDCP tended to elevate valeric acid and branched chain  acid (BCFA) concentrations compared with the other diets. The P50 and FM groups had greater ammonia nitrogen and methylamine contents than the S50 and CDCP groups. There was a positive correlation between the  and ammonia nitrogen, the  and short chain  acid (), and a negative correlation between the  and BCFA. These findings suggested short-term feeding of different protein sources did not affect the piglets' growth, but P50 increased the diarrhea rate. Potential pathogenic bacteria and detrimental metabolites appeared in the colons of piglets fed P50 and FM, whereas, beneficial effects were conferred upon piglets fed CDCP and S50, thus indicating that available plant proteins (cotton seed, soy) added to the diets of piglets enhanced colon health by reducing protein fermentation.Copyright © 2019 Li, Chang, Hou, Song, Fan, He and Hou.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31396536>Xiao-Qing-Long Tang Prevents Cardiomyocyte Hypertrophy, Fibrosis, and the Development of Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Faction in Rats by Modulating the Composition of the Gut Microbiota.</a></h2><p>Changes in the gut microbiota are associated with cardiovascular disease progression.

This study aimed to identify the microbial basis of flavor by identifying the combined effects of LD type lactic acid bacteria (LAB) starters and Penicillium camemberti on the generation of metabolites during the ripening process. Metabolomics analyses were performed on three model cheeses: normal cheese, no-mold cheese with only LAB, and no-LAB cheese with only white mold. Aroma compounds and their potential precursors were analyzed using headspace solid-phase microextraction-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) and solvent extraction-GC/MS, respectively. Measurements during ripening and multivariate analyses on the data revealed the relationship between the microorganisms and metabolic activities, which were classified into four groups: metabolites generated by LAB and degraded by P. camemberti; metabolites generated by P. camemberti and degraded or inhibited by LAB; metabolites generated by P. camemberti and enhanced by LAB; and metabolites exhibiting no interaction between P. camemberti and LAB.

Apparent digestibility of nutrients; total concentration of , acetate and butyrate; and total rumen protozoa population were linearly increased by increasing the levels of bean residues, as replacement with wheat straw (p < .05). Replacement of bean residues in control diets instead of wheat straw or maize silage caused a positive linear incremental trend for average daily gain and total weight gain. There was no significant difference in daily gain, final weight and feed conversion ratio among the treatments. Instead of wheat straw or maize silage, replacement bean residues linearly increased chewing, ruminating and eating activities per neutral detergent fibre intake (p < .05). Carcass traits and physicochemical characteristics of meat were not affected by the treatments. It is advisable to use bean residues in the diet of lambs as an alternative to the wheat straw or maize silage, because no adverse effects were observed on rumen fermentation, blood metabolites and performance; moreover, improvement in average daily gain, total weight gain and digestibility of nutrients, and the fact that bean residue is less expensive than wheat straw and maize silage.© 2019 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31424518>Two different Clostridium perfringens strains produce different levels of necrotic enteritis in broiler chickens.</a></h2><p>Subclinical necrotic enteritis (NE) is primarily caused by the gram-positive bacterium, Clostridium perfringens (Cp). The trend towards removal of in-feed antimicrobials and subsequent increased emergence of infection in poultry has resulted in a wide interest in better understanding of the mechanism behind this disease. The virulence of NE, to a large extent, depends on the virulence of Cp strains. Thus, this study was to assess how 2 different strains of Cp affect performance and gut characteristics of broiler chickens. Ross 308 male broilers (n = 468) were assigned to a 2 × 3 factorial arrangement of treatments with antibiotics (Salinomycin at 72 ppm and zinc bacitracin at 50 ppm -, or +) and challenge (non-challenge, Cp EHE-NE18, or Cp WER-NE36). Oral administration of Eimeria oocysts (day 9) followed by inoculation with 1 mL 108 CFU Cp strains (day 14 and 15) were used to induce NE. Broiler performance was analyzed at day 10, 24, and 35. On day 16, intestinal lesion score and intestinal pH were evaluated and samples of cecal content were analyzed for bacterial counts and short-chain  acid concentrations (). Birds in both challenged groups showed higher feed conversion ratio (FCR), lower weight gain (P < 0.001), increased lesion scores in the jejunum (P < 0.01), and reduced pH in the ileum and cecum (P < 0.01), compared to the non-challenged birds. They also showed decreased numbers of Bacillus spp. (P < 0.001), and Ruminococcus spp. (P < 0.01) in the cecal content. On day 35, the NE36 challenged birds had a lower weight gain (P < 0.001) and higher FCR (P < 0.001) compared to the NE18 challenged birds. Interestingly, cecal Lactobacillus and lactate were increased by the NE challenge (P < 0.001), and to a greater extent in birds challenged with NE36 compared to the NE18 strain (P < 0.001).

While, polygalacturonic acid was fermented by Ba. fragilis, Ba. thetaiotaomicron, and Ba. uniformis. All the screened bacteria significantly decreased the pH from 7 to 5 (pH difference of ≈ 2), which clearly indicated that the above bacteria produced the enzymes necessary for the digestion of the pectic derived polysaccharides. The  profiles of the above screened bacteria clearly demonstrated the production of lactate, acetate and propionate which are the key metabolites involved in maintaining gut health and prevention of several intestinal diseases. Thus, pectic polysaccharides hold potential application in food industry as prebiotic ingredients or dietary fibers.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31528722>Fermentation characteristics of resistant starch, arabinoxylan, and β-glucan and their effects on the gut microbial ecology of pigs: A review.</a></h2><p>Dietary fibers (DF) contain an abundant amount of energy, although the mammalian genome does not encode most of the enzymes required to degrade them. However, a mutual dependence is developed between the host and symbiotic microbes, which has the potential to extract the energy present in these DF. Dietary fibers escape digestion in the foregut and are fermented in the hindgut, producing short-chain   () that alter the microbial ecology in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) of pigs. Most of the carbohydrates are fermented in the proximal part, allowing protein fermentation in the distal part, resulting in colonic diseases. The structures of resistant starch (RS), arabinoxylan (AX), and β-glucan (βG) are complex; hence, makes their way into the hindgut where these are fermented and provide energy substrates for the colonic epithelial cells. Different microbes have different preferences of binding to different substrates. The RS, AX and βG act as a unique substrate for the microbes and modify the relative composition of the gut microbial community. The granule dimension and surface area of each substrate are different, which influences the penetration capacity of microbes. Arabinose and xylan are 2 different hemicelluloses, but arabinose is substituted on the xylan backbone and occurs in the form of AX. Fermentation of xylan produces butyrate primarily in the small intestine, whereas arabinose produces butyrate in the large intestine. Types of RS and forms of βG also exert beneficial effects by producing different metabolites and modulating the intestinal microbiota. Therefore, it is important to have information of different types of RS, AX and βG and their roles in microbial modulation to get the optimum benefits of fiber fermentation in the gut. This review provides relevant information on the similarities and differences that exist in the way RS, AX, and βG are fermented, and their positive and negative effects on  production and gut microbial ecology of pigs. These insights will help nutritionists to develop dietary strategies that can modulate specific  production and promote beneficial microbiota in the GIT of swine.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31448571>Alterations in the human gut microbiome in anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor encephalitis.</a></h2><p>To explore the diversity and composition of the fecal microbiota in patients with anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) encephalitis.We enrolled 10 patients in the acute stage with naïve treatment, seven patients with relapse, 13 patients without relapse in the remission phase, and 12 paired healthy controls. The fecal microbiota in different groups was compared by 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) gene pyrosequencing.Prominent dysbiosis in the gut microbiome of patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis was found. Our primary findings showed that the overall species richness (alpha diversity indexes) of the microbiota was higher in patients than in controls (P < 0.05). Distance-based community analysis revealed that the microbiota differed substantially within all subgroups of patients and controls (P < 0.05). The relative abundance of species heatmap showed a tendency toward depletion for some commensal genera, such as Prevotella_6, Bifidobacterium, Faecalibacterium, and other short-chain  acid ()-producing bacteria. Additionally, our results showed that all subgroups had a distinct bacterial species, with an increase in the genus Fusobacterium in the acute phase group and the genera Streptococcus and Parabacteroides in patients with relapse. However, the genus Bacteroides was very abundant in patients without relapse. Although the findings regarding the Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes (F/B) ratios across the four comparison groups were not statistically significant, the F/B ratio gradually increased in patients from the acute phase group (0.87), to the disease remission group with relapse (1.06), to the group without relapse (1.28), to the healthy group (1.63).Patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis exhibit a substantial alteration in fecal microbiota composition.© 2019 The Authors.

VFAs are considered an excellent carbon source for the biological nutrient removal (BNR) process. Dissolved organic matter (DOM) in fermentation liquid is the direct substrate used for producing VFAs and can greatly influence the effluent quality of BNR process. However, knowledge of DOM characteristics in sludge alkaline fermentation is limited. This study focused on the functional groups, fluorescent components and molecular features of DOM as well as molecular weight of proteins in SS alkaline fermentation (at pH uncontrolled, 7, 8, 9 and 10). Results showed a significantly improved generation of tryptophan-like and tyrosine-like substances as well as molecular weight <1 kDa proteins (381.5 ± 38.4 mg/L) was observed at pH 10 (p < 0.05). Further analysis of DOM molecular characteristics indicated that pH 10 resulted in the highest molecular diversity and the generation or degradation of easily biodegradable lipid-like and proteins/amino sugars-like formulas. The improved solubilization of DOM contributed to VFAs production. Meanwhile, increasing pH to 10 also promoted the release of hard-biodegradable organic matter, e.g., humic-like and lignin-like substances. Additionally, a high diversity of resistant N-containing organic molecules was generated at pH 10. Fermentation of SS at pH 10, is favored to enhance VFAs production and, can also result in a higher content of refractory DOM. This study helps to achieve a comprehensive understanding of SS alkaline fermentation and provides fundamental information for further treatment.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Twenty-four growing Suffolk sheep were divided into three treatments and were fed hay  plus 600 g/d of concentrate containing no PBLC (Control) or PBLC at low dose (80 mg/d; PBLC-L) or high dose (160 mg/d; PBLC-H). After 4 weeks on the diets, samples of ruminal digesta were collected and analyzed for short-chain  acid (), ammonia, and microbiota; microbiota being analyzed in the solid and the liquid digesta fractions separately. Ruminal  and ammonia concentrations were not affected by the PBLC treatments. The microbiota in the solid fraction was more diverse than that in the liquid fraction, and the relative abundance of most taxa differed between these two fractions. In the solid fraction, phylogenetic diversity increased linearly with increased PBLC doses, whereas evenness (lowest in PBLC-L) and Simpson diversity index (greatest in PBLC-H) changed quadratically. In the liquid fraction, however, the PBLC supplementation did not affect any of the microbial diversity measurements. Among phyla,  (highest in PBLC-L) and unclassified_bacteria (lowest in PBLC-L) were altered quadratically by PBLC. ,  (increased linearly),  (increased in PBLC-L),  (decreased in PBLC treatments), and  (increased in PBLC treatments) were affected at the family level. Among genera,  increased linearly in the solid fraction,  increased linearly in the liquid fraction, whereas  increased and  increased linearly with increasing doses of PBLC in both fractions. The PBLC treatments also lowered methanogens within the classes  and . Correlation network analysis revealed positive and negative correlations among many microbial taxa. Differential network analysis showed that PBLC supplementation changed the correlation between some microbial taxa and . The majority of the predicted functional features were different between the solid and the liquid digesta fractions, whereas the PBLC treatments altered few of the predicted functional gene categories.

However, the signature microbiota responsible for linking dietary regimes to rumen function shifts are still unclear. This work analyzed the rumen microbiome and functions affected by an early solid diet regime using a combination of machine learning algorithms.  (i.e., acetate, propionate and butyrate) fermented by microbes were found to increase significantly in the supplementary solid diet groups. Predominant genera were found to alter significantly from unclassified  (non-supplementary group) to  (supplementary solid diet groups). Random Forest classification model revealed signature microbiota for solid diet that positively correlated with macronutrient intake, and linearly increased with   acid production. Bacteria associated with carbohydrate and protein metabolism were also identified. Utilization of a Fish Taco analysis portrayed a set of intersecting core species contributed to rumen function shifts by the solid diet regime. The core community structures consisted of the specific, signature microbiota and the manipulation of their symbiotic partners are manipulated by extra nutrients from concentrate and/or forage, and then produce more  to promote rumen development and functions eventually host development.

The ghrelin receptor [growth hormone secretagogue receptor (GHSR)-1a] is a GPCR expressed throughout both the gut and the brain and plays a crucial role in maintaining energy balance, metabolism, and the central modulation of food intake, motivation, reward, and mood. To date, few studies have investigated the potential of the gastrointestinal microbiota and its metabolites to modulate GPCR signaling. Here we investigate the ability of short-chain   (SCFAs), lactate, and different bacterial strains, including  and  genera, to modulate GHSR-1a signaling. We identify, for what is to our knowledge the first time, a potent effect of microbiota-derived metabolites on GHSR-1a signaling with potential significant consequences for host metabolism and physiology. We show that SCFAs, lactate, and bacterial supernatants are able to attenuate ghrelin-mediated signaling through the GHSR-1a. We suggest a novel route of communication between the gut microbiota and the host  modulation of GHSR-1a receptor signaling. Together, this highlights the emerging therapeutic potential in the exploration of the microbiota metabolome in the specific targeting of key GPCRs, with pleiotropic actions that span both the CNS and periphery.-Torres-Fuentes, C., Golubeva, A.

The results showed that fecal water content increased in treated mice; there was less gut microbiota diversity than in other groups; and there was a large number of fauna in the cecum of the mice. At the same time, the number of short-chain  acid () bacterial producers increased after feeding with oligosaccharides; Lotus seed oligosaccharides (LOS) also enhanced the concentration of SCFAs in the intestine, which also increased the concentration of cytokines in the serum of mice. In conclusion, these findings suggest that LOS or combination with resistant starch has a better effect on relieving constipation.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

In marine diatoms, these molecules can be highly bioactive, impacting zooplankton grazers, bacteria and other phytoplankton. However, the ultimate cause for oxylipin production in diatoms is still poorly understood, from an evolutionary perspective. Here we analysed production of particulate linear oxygenated   (LOFAs, previously named non- oxylipins) from natural phytoplankton collected weekly for 1 year. We demonstrate for the first time that diatoms are the main LOFA producers in natural phytoplankton assemblages. Interestingly, LOFA-per-cell production decreased with increasing diatom density and was not due to major changes in diatom community composition. An inverse relation was confirmed at a global scale by analysing diatom lipoxygenase unigenes and metagenomes from Tara Oceans datasets. A network analysis suggested that different LOFAs could contribute to modulate co-variations of different diatom taxa. Overall, we offer new insights in diatom chemical ecology, possibly explaining the evolution of oxylipin synthesis in diatoms.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31472405>Essential regulators of iron chemical speciation distributions in anaerobic digestion of pretreated food waste: Organic  or inorganic acid radicals?</a></h2><p>In this work, a 30-days batched mesophilic assay on pretreated food waste (PFW) under different inoculum/substrate (I/S) ratios (1:5, 1:2, 1:1, 2:1, 4:1 and 1:0) was carried out, to target the most important parameters in AD matrix on regulating iron (Fe) chemical speciation. Correlation coefficients were calculated within four Fe chemical forms and AD parameters of pH,  (VFAs), inorganic acid radicals (IARs), and alkalinity. Results showed that IARs were not key factors on regulating Fe speciation. Without acidification, IARs showed weak correlations (coefficients < 0.40) with Fe chemical dynamics while other parameters showed stronger correlations (coefficients ≥ 0.60). Under acidification, VFAs initiated the conversion of exchangeable Fe into water soluble fraction.

We performed a systematic review using the PubMed/Medline database including primary articles written in English that measured leptin production or levels as well as  used as an intervention, mechanism or outcome. The search yielded a total of 573 citations; 36 studies were included in the final analysis. The quality of the studies was analyzed through two validated tools based on objective criteria. Overall, the studies presented low risk of bias to construct and statistical validity. However, the majority presented a high risk of attrition and detection bias. In vitro studies (n = 8) consistently demonstrated that  stimulate leptin expression in adipocytes through activation of free  acid receptor 3 (FFAR3). In animal studies (n = 24), interventions to modulate high-fat diet outcomes predominantly caused a decrease in circulating leptin levels and increased , associated with suppressed weight gain. Control of dysbiosis through administration of prebiotics and probiotics also played a role in leptin synthesis in animal studies. In human studies (n = 4) leptin was mainly correlated with adiposity but dysbiosis interfered with this relationship. We conclude that the association between  and leptin remains incompletely understood but occurs mainly through the activation of FFAR3 in adipocytes. However, body fat rather than  remains the main driver for leptin synthesis in vivo.

In this configuration, the process performance in both temperatures were estimated and the microbial communities were characterized by full-length16S rRNA genes and/or microbial activities. In addition, the appropriate solubilization reaction time was assessed. The results revealed that the higher hydrolysis and acidogenesis activities were achieved with longer reaction time of pretreatment (5 days) and thus higher organic nitrogen conversion and alkalinity were attained. Under appropriate pretreatment reaction time, pretreated sludge was characterized by 65% higher organic matters solubilization and 1.4-fold higher  (VFAs) concentration compared to raw sludge. The overall methane yield produced under this scenario was 179 L CH. KgVS, with 15% of the absolute yield was produced in hydrolysis reactor. 50% reduction in bacteria belong to Firmicurtes was observed at mesophilic reactor and meanwhile the relative abundance of Bacteroidetes and Cloacimonetes were enhanced. The predominant methanogens in both stages did not change implying adaptation of Methanothermobacter (>62%) to mesophilic condition. However, increasing acetoclastic methanogens up to 30% in mesophilic reactor indicating methane was produced from pretreated sludge mainly through H- mediated CO reduction and partially from acetate cleavage.

Considering tumor is a type of metabolic disease, we investigated the metabolomics changes in serum and tumor after apatinib treatment and the molecular mechanism of characteristic changes associated with its antitumor efficacy. Molecules in serum and tumor tissue were extracted and analyzed by a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry metabolic platform. Apatinib significantly inhibited e tumor growth and alleviated metabolic rearrangement in both serum and tumor of A549 xenograft mice. Among these endogenous metabolites, 3-hydroxybutyric acid (3-HB) was significantly increased in serum, tumor and liver after apatinib treatment. Interestingly, giving exogenous 3-HB also inhibited tumor growth. Gene expression, dual luciferase reporter gene assay and molecular docking analysis all indicated that apatinib could induce 3-HB production through the dependent activation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) and promotion of  acid utilization in the liver. Therefore, increased content of 3-HB induced by PPARα activation in the liver partially contributed to the antitumor effect of apatinib.

The results show that antibiotic effects on the gut microbiota were stronger in AMC rats relative to AST1D rats.

We found that AMC rats had a more notable metabolic response to antibiotic exposure than AST1D rats.

A similar behavior was shown by the other undesired microbial groups and a complete disappearance of staphylococci was registered. The microbiological counts of 9-month ripened cheeses showed the dominance of LAB and undetectable levels of the undesired bacteria. MiSeq Illumina was applied to better investigate the bacterial composition of ripened cheeses and this technique evidenced that the majority of OTUs belonged to Lactobacillus and Streptococcus genera. The final cheeses were characterized by 67.65% dry matter of which 41.85% of fats and 47.02% of proteins. The main cheese   were palmitic, oleic and myristic  and the saturated  /unsaturated   ratio was 2.17. Forty-one  compounds, including , esters, ketones, alcohols, aldehydes, phenols and one terpene were emitted from the cheese. Sensory evaluation showed a general appreciation for the new cheese product by judges.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Anal sacs are an important odor producing organ found across the carnivorans (species in the mammalian Order Carnivora). Secretions from the anal sac may be used as chemical signals by animals for behaviors ranging from defense to species recognition to signaling reproductive status. In addition, a recent study suggests that domestic cats utilize short-chain free   in anal sac secretions for individual recognition. The fermentation hypothesis is the idea that symbiotic microorganisms living in association with animals contribute to odor profiles used in chemical communication and that variation in these chemical signals reflects variation in the microbial community. Here we examine the fermentation hypothesis by characterizing  organic compounds (VOC) and bacteria isolated from anal sac secretions collected from a male Bengal cat (Felis catus × Prionailurus bengalensis), a cross between the domestic cat and the leopard cat. Both left and right anal sacs of a male Bengal cat were manually expressed (emptied) and collected. Half of the material was used to culture bacteria or to extract bacterial DNA and the other half was used for VOC analysis. DNA was extracted from the anal sac secretions and used for a 16S rRNA gene PCR amplification and sequencing based characterization of the microbial community. Additionally, some of the material was plated out in order to isolate bacterial colonies. Three taxa (Bacteroides fragilis, Tessaracoccus, and Finegoldia magna) were relatively abundant in the 16S rRNA gene sequence data and also isolated by culturing. Using Solid Phase Microextraction (SPME) gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), we tentatively identified 52 compounds from the Bengal cat anal sac secretions and 67 compounds from cultures of the three bacterial isolates chosen for further analysis. Among 67 compounds tentatively identified from bacterial isolates, 51 were also found in the anal sac secretion. We show that the bacterial community in the anal sac consists primarily of only a few abundant taxa and that isolates of these taxa produce numerous volatiles that are found in the combined anal sac  profile. Several of these volatiles are found in anal sac secretions from other carnivorans, and are also associated with known bacterial biosynthesis pathways. This is consistent with the fermentation hypothesis and the possibility that the anal sac is maintained at least in part to house bacteria that produce volatiles for the host.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31437166>The long-term consequences of antibiotic therapy: Role of colonic short-chain   () system and intestinal barrier integrity.</a></h2><p>Epidemiological studies revealed that antibiotics exposure increases a risk of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) development. It remained largely unknown how antibiotic-induced dysbiosis confers the risk for enhanced inflammatory response. The aim of the present study was to test the hypothesis that SCFAs, their receptors and transporters mediate the antibiotic long-term effects on the functional state of colonic mucosa and susceptibility to the experimental colitis. Male Wistar rats were treated daily for 14 days with antibiotic ceftriaxone (300 mg/kg, i.m.) or vehicle; euthanized by CO2 inhalation followed by cervical dislocation in 1, 14 or 56 days after antibiotic withdrawal. We found increased cecum weight and sustained changes in microbiota composition after ceftriaxone treatment with increased number of conditionally pathogenic enterobacteria, E. coli, Clostridium, Staphylococcus spp. and hemolytic bacteria even at 56 days after antibiotic withdrawal. The concentration of SCFAs was decreased after ceftriaxone withdrawal. We found decreased immunoreactivity of the FFA2, FFA3 receptors, SMCT1 and increased MCT1 & MCT4 transporters of SCFAs in colon mucosa. These changes evoked a significant shift in colonic mucosal homeostasis: the disturbance of oxidant-antioxidant balance; activation of redox-sensitive transcription factor HIF1α and ERK1/2 MAP kinase; increased colonic epithelial permeability and bacterial translocation to blood; morphological remodeling of the colonic tissue. Ceftriaxone pretreatment significantly reinforced inflammation during experimental colitis 56 days after ceftriaxone withdrawal, which was confirmed by increased histopathology of colitis, Goblet cell dysfunction, colonic dilatation and wall thickening, and increased serum levels of inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α and IL-10). Since the recognition of the importance of microbiota metabolic activity rather than their composition in the development of inflammatory disorders, e.g. IBD, the present study is the first report on the role of the  system in the long lasting side effects of antibiotic treatment and its implication in IBD development.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31471133>Enantioseparation of three isomeric α-(chlorophenyl)propanoic acid by countercurrent chromatography and investigation of chlorine substituent through characterization of inclusion interaction.</a></h2><p>The influence of chlorine substituents in chiral separation of three racemic 2-(chlorophenyl)propanoic  by countercurrent chromatography using hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin as a chiral additive were mainly investigated in the present paper, including 2-(2-chlorophenyl)propanoic , 2-(3-chlorophenyl)propanoic  and 2-(4-chlorophenyl)propanoic . The influences of chromatographic conditions on the retention behavior were studied by enantioselective liquid-liquid extraction experiments using the methodology of response surface It was found that 2-(3-chlorophenyl)propanoic  could be successfully chiral separated by countercurrent chromatography, while no resolution was achieved for racemic 2-(2-chlorophenyl)propanoic  and 2-(4-chlorophenyl)propanoic  under optimized separation conditions. The formation of 1:1 stoichiometric inclusion compounds between 2-(3-chlorophenyl)propanoic  and HP-β-CD was determined by UV spectra measurements. The inclusion constants for 2-(3-chlorophenyl)propanoic  and HP-β-CD were determined by the Benesi-Hildebrand equation. Meanwhile, the inclusion constants of 2-(3-chlorophenyl)-propanoic acid enantiomer and HP-β-CD were obtained by the pesudophase retention equation in countercurrent chromatography. Furthermore, the inclusion interactions of the three racemates with HP-β-CD were also investigated by the molecular docking. The results obtained from UV spectra measurements and molecular docking showed that the racemate with chlorine substituents in meta-position presented the highest enantiorecognition while the racemates with chlorine substituents in ortho-position had the lowest enantiorecognition. The above results further indicated that forming a stable inclusion complex between racemate and chiral selector is a prerequisite for a successful enantioseparation and at the same time, the difference in inclusion capacity between the two enantiomers is also essential for the enantioseparation.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The objectives of this study were to determine the effects of supplementing SFA in the form of triglycerides (TSFA), as compared to CSFA, on yields, efficiency and diet digestibility in high-yielding dairy cows. Twenty-eight (14 cows in each group) multiparous cows were fed a basal diet supplemented (on DM basis) with either 12 g/kg TSFA (~350 g/cow per day - contained 980 g/kg fat; 882.3 g/kg SFAs) or 14 g/kg CSFA (~440 g/cow per day - contained 800 g/kg fat; 566.4 g/kg SFAs). The supplement amounts in the diet were balanced according to fat content. Rumen samples were taken for measurements of ammonia and  concentrations, and fecal samples were taken for digestibility measurements. The CSFA cows produced 3% higher milk yields (47.6 v. 46.2 kg/day; P < 0.0001) and 4.7% higher 4% fat-corrected milk (FCM; 44.7 v. 42.7 kg/day; P = 0.02) than the TSFA cows. No difference in milk-fat content was observed, but milk-protein content was higher in the TSFA than CSFA cows. Yields of fat and protein were similar, but lactose yields were higher in TSFA cows. There were no differences in dry matter intake or efficiency calculations between groups. The ruminal ammonia concentrations were similar between groups, whereas acetate concentrations and acetate : propionate ratio were greater for CSFA than TSFA cows. The apparent total-tract digestibility of dry (P < 0.0007) and organic matters (P < 0.0003), fat (P < 0.0001), NDF and ADF (P = 0.02) were lower in the TSFA v. CSFA cows. In conclusion, the CSFA-supplemented cows produced 3% higher milk and 4.7% higher 4% FCM than the TSFA cows. However, TSFA supplementation did not depress milk-protein content. The apparent total-tract digestibility was lower for all dietary components in the TSFA cows, which was probably due to the effects of both degree of saturation and triglyceride form of the TSFA supplement. Considering that diets were balanced according to the fat content of the supplements, the lower yields of milk and FCM observed in the TSFA than CSFA cows were likely due to the lower digestibility of the fat and other nutrients in the TSFA cows, which might have negatively influenced the dietary energy content.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31572572>Meat quality,  compounds, and antioxidant properties of lambs fed pasture versus mixed diet.</a></h2><p>The aim of the present work was to investigate the effects of feeding regimens (pasture vs. mixed diet) on meat quality,  compounds, and antioxidant properties in lamb meat. In total, 24 lambs were allotted into two feeding regimens at 10.23 kg live weight. Lambs were fed on pasture grass (PG group,  = 12) or mixed diet (M group,  = 12).   (LT) muscle samples from the M group had a higher intramuscular fat (IMF) ( < 0.05), pHvalue ( < 0.01), and ash ( < 0.05) than the PG group. In contrast, the shear force ( < 0.05), L*( < 0.05), and b* ( < 0.001) in M group were lower than in PG group. Analyses indicated that PG group contained higher linolenic acid (C18:3n3) and docosatrienoic acid (C22:3n6) ( < 0.05) than the M group. Major  compounds in the muscles included hexanal, heptanal, nonanal, octanal, 1-pentanol, 1-hexanol, 1-octen-3-ol, and 2,3-octanedione. The levels of hexanal, nonanal, and 2,3-octanedione were significantly lower in PG lamb muscle ( < 0.01). In contrast, 1-pentanol and 1-hexanol levels were higher in M lamb muscle ( < 0.01). Muscle from PG lamb exhibited higher catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity ( < 0.05). PG muscle also contained a higher radical-scavenging ability (RSA;  < 0.001) and cupric-reducing antioxidant capacity (CUPRAC;  < 0.05). Overall, the improved antioxidant status in PG muscle inhibited lipid peroxidation (aldehydes and ketones), thereby improving the meat quality.© 2019 The Authors.

Even with its increasing applications, there have been no previous theoretical studies that explain the experimental results based on its molecular behavior. In this context, this work used calculations based on the density functional theory (DFT) combined with experimental results to elucidate the decomposition mechanisms of PAA for predicting its stability and the possible products generated from its decomposition. The results obtained showed that the protonation of PAA promoted its spontaneous decomposition in acetic acid and molecular oxygen. The hydrolysis mechanism of PAA in acidic medium indicated that the low energy difference involved in the mechanism's stages is responsible for the equilibrium between PAA and HO. The structural and electronic comparison of PAA with HO showed that the O-O bond length of PAA is longer than that of HO and is also weaker, therefore may demonstrate greater efficiency in advanced oxidative processes by photocatalysis.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Four weeks male hamsters were divided into 3 groups (n=10). Two hypercholesterolemic groups were fed for 35 days with hypercholesterolemic diet, containing 20% (w/w) wheat gluten or casein. Wheat gluten significantly reduced serum total cholesterol (TC), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) concentrations, and also decreased the liver total cholesterol (TC), free cholesterol (FC), cholesterol ester (CE), triglycerides (TG) concentrations. Wheat gluten group had a higher fecal lipids, total cholesterol (TC) and bile  (BA) than that of casein group (p < 0.05). Moreover, wheat gluten significantly increased total short-chain   () concentrations in feces. Sequencing of 16S rRNA gene revealed that intake of wheat gluten decreased the relative abundances of Firmicutes and Erysipelotrichaceae, but to increased the relative abundances of Bateroidetes, Bacteroidales_S24-7_group and Ruminococcaceae. The lipid lowering properties of wheat gluten was associated with the lower ratio of Firmicutes/Bateroidetes, the lower of the bacterial taxa Erysipelotrichaceae and the higher of the bacterial taxa Bacteroidales_S24-7_group and Ruminococcaceae.

These effects have been speculated to occur via the gut microbiome. In this study, we administered either berberine or metformin to db/db mice and investigated changes in body weight, food intake, and blood glucose levels. Fresh stool samples were analyzed using 16 s rDNA high-throughput sequencing to evaluate the gut microbiome. Short-chain   () in the stool were quantified using gas chromatography. The expression of NF-κB signaling pathway and tight junction (ZO1 and occludin) proteins in the intestinal epithelium was determined using qPCR and western blotting. The intestinal barrier structure was examined using transmission electron microscopy and serum lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was measured using a commercial kit. Both berberine and metformin reduced food intake, body weight, and blood glucose and HbA1c levels. Both treatments effectively restored the intestinal  content, reduced the level of serum LPS, relieved intestinal inflammation, and repaired intestinal barrier structure. Intervention with metformin or berberine modified the gut microbiome in db/db mice, increasing the number of -producing bacteria (e.g., Butyricimonas, Coprococcus, Ruminococcus) and reducing opportunistic pathogens (e.g., Prevotella, Proteus). An increased abundance of other probiotics including Lactobacillus and Akkermansia was also observed. Berberine and metformin can modulate the composition of the gut microbiome and reduce body weight, blood glucose levels, and intestinal inflammation in db/db mice, which demonstrates their effectiveness in the reduction of diabetic complications in this model.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

Use of systems like this might be used to predict changes to the emergent properties of the gut ecosystem when diet is altered, with the aim of beneficially affecting human physiology. This study addresses the question as to how bacterial species, characteristic of the human gut microbiota, collectively utilize mixtures of plant polysaccharides such as are found in dietary fiber. Five bacterial species with the capacity to degrade polymers and/or produce acidic fermentation products detectable in human feces were used in the experiments. The bacteria showed preferential use of certain polysaccharides over others for growth, and this influenced their fermentation output qualitatively. These kinds of studies are essential in developing concepts of how the gut microbial community shares habitat resources, directly and indirectly, when presented with mixtures of polysaccharides that are found in human diets. The concepts are required in planning dietary interventions that might correct imbalances in the functioning of the human microbiota so as to support measures to reduce metabolic conditions such as obesity.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31606600>Effect of additional food waste slurry generated by mesophilic acidogenic fermentation on nutrient removal and sludge properties during wastewater treatment.</a></h2><p>Fermentation slurry from food waste (FSFW) generated by acidogenic fermentation at mesophilic temperature was utilized to improve the nutrients removal from wastewater. Organic  (such as lactate and ) in the FSFW behaved as readily biodegradable carbon sources, while the particulate and macromolecular organics acted as slowly biodegradable carbon sources during denitrification processes. The FSFW dosage significantly influenced the nitrogen removal performance, and a C/N ratio (in terms of chemical oxygen demand to nitrogen ratio) of 8 could achieve complete denitrification in the batch tests. In a sequencing batch reactor (SBR) using FSFW for long-term wastewater treatment, extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) gradually accumulated, sludge particle size significantly increased, and microbial communities were selectively enriched, which contributed to promoting the nitrogen (>80%) and phosphate (90.1%) removal efficiencies.

Here, we investigate the extent and functional basis of host-microbial interactions regulating rumen development during the first 6 weeks of life.The use of microbial metagenomics, together with quantification of  (VFAs) and qPCR, reveals the colonization of an active bacterial community in the rumen at birth. Colonization of active complex carbohydrate fermenters and archaea with methyl-coenzyme M reductase activity was also observed from the first week of life in the absence of a solid diet. Integrating microbial metagenomics and host transcriptomics reveals only 26.3% of mRNA transcripts, and 46.4% of miRNAs were responsive to VFAs, while others were ontogenic. Among these, one host gene module was positively associated with VFAs, while two other host gene modules and one miRNA module were negatively associated with VFAs. Eight host genes and five miRNAs involved in zinc ion binding-related transcriptional regulation were associated with a rumen bacterial cluster consisting of Prevotella, Bacteroides, and Ruminococcus.This three-way interaction suggests a potential role of bacteria-driven transcriptional regulation in early rumen development via miRNAs.

The present study determined if gut microbial signatures could transfer cardiovascular risk phenotypes between lean and obese mice using cecal microbiota transplantation (CMT). Pooled cecal contents collected from obese leptin-deficient (Ob) mice or C57Bl/6j control (Con) mice were transplanted by oral gavage into cohorts of recipient Ob and Con mice maintained on identical low-fat diets for 8 weeks (n=9-11/group). Cardiovascular pathology was assessed as the degree of arterial stiffness (aortic pulse wave velocity) and myocardial infarct size following a 45/120 min  global cardiac ischemia/reperfusion protocol. Gut microbiota was characterized by 16s rDNA sequencing, along with measures of intestinal barrier function and cecal short-chain  acid () composition. Following CMT, the gut microbiota of recipient mice was altered to resemble that of the donors. Ob CMT to Con mice increased arterial stiffness, left ventricular (LV) mass and myocardial infarct size, which was associated with greater gut permeability and reduced cecal  concentrations. Conversely, Con CMT to Ob mice increased cecal , reduced LV mass and attenuated myocardial infarct size, with no effects on gut permeability or arterial stiffness. Collectively, these data demonstrate that obesity-related changes in the gut microbiota, independent of dietary manipulation, regulate hallmark measures of cardiovascular pathology in mice, and highlight the potential of microbiota-targeted therapeutics for reducing cardiovascular pathology and risk in obesity.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31493107>Ruminal and histological characteristics and nitrogen balance in lamb fed diets containing cactus as the only roughage.</a></h2><p>This study examined rumen fermentation, histological, blood, and urinary characteristics as well as ammoniacal nitrogen concentration, pH, nitrogen balance, and microbial protein in lamb fed diets containing spineless cactus as the sole roughage source plus levels of wheat bran (WB) in comparison with a control diet based on spineless cactus and buffelgrass. Twenty-eight uncastrated, crossbreed lambs with an average initial weight of 22.6 ± 2.37 kg were used in the experiment. The treatments consisted of a standard diet (control) containing buffelgrass and spineless cactus and three diets containing cactus as the only roughage source plus varied concentrations of WB (30, 37, and 44%, on a dry matter basis). Results were evaluated by analysis of variance, and contrasts were applied at the 5% probability level for mean comparison. Rumen villus height and width were greater and musculature was lower in the lamb fed diets containing 37% and 44% WB compared with those fed control diet.

Although a previous analysis of MS gut microbiota revealed a reduction in species producing short-chain   (SCFAs), the influence of these metabolites on demyelination and remyelination, the critical factors of MS pathogenesis, remains unclear.To investigate the relationship between demyelination and gut microbiota, we administered a mixture of non-absorbing antibiotics or SCFAs to mice with cuprizone-induced demyelination and evaluated demyelination and the accumulation of microglia. To analyze the direct effect of SCFAs on demyelination or remyelination, we induced demyelination in an organotypic cerebellar slice culture using lysolecithin and analyzed the demyelination and maturation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells with or without  treatment.The oral administration of antibiotics significantly enhanced cuprizone-induced demyelination. The oral administration of butyrate significantly ameliorated demyelination, even though the accumulation of microglia into demyelinated lesions was not affected. Furthermore, we showed that butyrate treatment significantly suppressed lysolecithin-induced demyelination and enhanced remyelination in an organotypic slice culture in the presence or absence of microglia, suggesting that butyrate may affect oligodendrocytes directly. Butyrate treatment facilitated the differentiation of immature oligodendrocytes.We revealed that treatment with butyrate suppressed demyelination and enhanced remyelination in an organotypic slice culture in association with facilitating oligodendrocyte differentiation.

Three types of manure [chicken (T1), pig (T2), and cow (T3)] were inoculated with BSFL (1.2:7 ratio on fresh weight basis), three types without BSFL were used as control (T4, T5, and T6), and both were composted for 9 days. The results showed that the BSFL composting reduced the organic matter by 20.31-22.18% and the accumulation of VFAs by 25.58-80.08% as compared to the control. BSFL composting greatly decreased the nitrogen, by 6.08-14.37%.

The first group was fed on a diet without any treatment (CON), while the remaining three diets were added with aflatoxin B1 at 0.25 ppm diet. Diet fed to the third and fourth group of rabbits were further supplemented with sodium bentonite at 5 g/kg (SOB) and coumarin at 5 g/kg (COU) of the diet, respectively. Feeding aflatoxin-contaminated diet (AFL) caused necrosis of liver tissue and reduced the weight gain, average daily gain, feed conversion ratio, nutrient digestibility coefficients, and nitrogen balance of rabbits. This, in turn, was reflected as a reduction in carcass characteristics. The serum collected from rabbits fed aflatoxin-contaminated diet showed decreased levels of total protein, albumin, globulin, glucose, total cholesterol, and triglycerides, and increased concentrations of urea, creatinine, and liver enzymes. Further, aflatoxin diet increased the cecal pH, and decreased the ammonia nitrogen, total , and individual   proportion of cecal fluid. Supplementing sodium bentonite and coumarin at 5 g/kg diet reduced the negative effects of aflatoxin B1 on growth performance, digestibility of nutrients, biochemical parameters, carcass characteristics, and cecal fermentation profile. Furthermore, the coumarin-supplemented group showed better body weight gains and carcass weights compared to the rabbits fed with diets containing sodium bentonite. In conclusion, both sodium bentonite and coumarin supplementation was beneficial in ameliorating the toxicity of aflatoxin B1. Further, the increased body weight gains and better-feed conversion in coumarin-supplemented rabbits project the coumarin as a better anti-aflatoxigenic supplement.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

An efficient and reliable chiral analytical method was developed to determine the glufosinate enantiomers and two metabolites in soil and water samples using high-performance liquid chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry (HPLC-HRMS). The linearities of the matrix-matched calibration curves in five water and four soil samples were good with a correlation coefficient  > 0.998, and the mean recoveries were 85.2-100.4%, with relative standard deviations of 1.0-7.1%. l-Glufosinate was degraded faster than d-glufosinate in four nonsterile natural soil and two nonsterile natural water samples. The degradation half-lives of the enantiomers ranged from 3.4 to 33.0 days in the soil samples, but glufosinate was stable in the five water samples, less than 22% of the applied substance degraded at the end of the experiment (100 days). Degradation in sterile soil was not enantioselective. The two enantiomers were configurationally stable in the four soil and five water samples. In most cases of glufosinate degradation in soils, the percentage of 3-methylphosphinicopropionic in relation to the parent was higher than that of -acetyl-glufosinate. l-Glufosinate was preferentially degraded in the four soils, and formation of 3-methylphosphinicopropionic acid and -acetyl-glufosinate was enantiomer dependent.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31467327>Circulating but not faecal short-chain   are related to insulin sensitivity, lipolysis and GLP-1 concentrations in humans.</a></h2><p>Microbial-derived short-chain   () acetate, propionate and butyrate may provide a link between gut microbiota and whole-body insulin sensitivity (IS). In this cross-sectional study (160 participants, 64% male, BMI: 19.2-41.0 kg/m, normal or impaired glucose metabolism), associations between  (faecal and fasting circulating) and circulating metabolites, substrate oxidation and IS were investigated. In a subgroup (n = 93), IS was determined using a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp. Data were analyzed using multiple linear regression analysis adjusted for sex, age and BMI. Fasting circulating acetate, propionate and butyrate concentrations were positively associated with fasting GLP-1 concentrations. Additionally, circulating  were negatively related to whole-body lipolysis (glycerol), triacylglycerols and free   levels (standardized (std) β adjusted (adj) -0.190, P = 0.023; std β adj -0.202, P = 0.010; std β adj -0.306, P = 0.001, respectively). Circulating acetate and propionate were, respectively, negatively and positively correlated with IS (M-value: std β adj -0.294, P < 0.001; std β adj 0.161, P = 0.033, respectively). We show that circulating rather than faecal  were associated with GLP-1 concentrations, whole-body lipolysis and peripheral IS in humans. Therefore, circulating  are more directly linked to metabolic health, which indicates the need to measure circulating  in human prebiotic/probiotic intervention studies as a biomarker/mediator of effects on host metabolism.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31604174>Cow manure as additive to a DMBR for stable and high-rate digestion of food waste: Performance and microbial community.</a></h2><p>Cow manure (CM) was added to a dynamic membrane bioreactor (DMBR) operated under anaerobic condition for enhancing food waste (FW) digestion for over 300 days with stepwise increase of organic loading rates (OLRs) from 1.07 to 11.9 g COD/L/day. At a FW/CM ratio of 3.5:1 (based on  solids), the mixed liquor pH was always above 8.0 and no apparent  (VFAs) accumulation occurred even at the highest OLR of 11.9 g COD/L/day (hydraulic retention time as 10 days and solid retention time as 15.5 days, correspondingly), indicating a very stable operation condition which resulted in an average CH yield as high as 250 mL/g COD and CH production as high as 2.71 L CH/L/day. The hardly biodegradable organic components, such as cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin, were effectively degraded by 78.3%, 58.8%, and 47.5%, respectively. Significantly high anaerobic digestion reaction ratios, especially the hydrolysis ratio which is usually the limiting factor, were calculated based on experimental results. Furthermore, the high lignocellulase contents and coenzyme F levels, along with the decrease of cellulose crystallinity from 72.6% to 16.4% in the feedstock, provided strong evidence of an enhanced biological activity by CM addition. By high-throughput sequencing analysis, more abundant and diverse bacterial, archaeal, and fungal genera were identified from the DMBR sludge. With CM addition, the biodegradation of lignocellulose might have produced sufficient H and CO for the hydrogenotrophic methanogens such as Methanoculleus, Methanomassiliicoccus, and Methanobacterium, which were highly tolerant to ammonium inhibition, and then the elevated ammonium level would have provided high buffering capacity in the DMBR thus ensuring a stable condition for high rate FW digestion and CH production.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Anaerobic processes are suitable for the treatment of wastewater high in organics to achieve pollution control and recovery of energy as methane and hydrogen, or intermediates for production of biofuels and valuable biochemicals. A distinction between protein hydrolysis and amino acid fermentation, especially for dissolved proteins, is needed to target which one is truly rate-limiting and to effectively harvest bioproducts during anaerobic conversion of these wastewaters. This study explored mesophilic anaerobic hydrolysis and amino acid fermentation of gelatine, as a model for dissolved proteins, at pH 7 and at pH 5.The results showed that at pH 7, protein hydrolysis (first-order rate of 0.15 h) was approximately 5 times faster than acidification of the hydrolysis products (first-order rate of 0.03 h), implying that not hydrolysis but acidification was the rate-limiting step in anaerobic dissolved protein degradation. This was confirmed by (temporary) accumulation of amino . Nineteen different amino  were detected during the first 8 incubation hours of gelatine at neutral pH and the total chemical oxygen demand (COD) of these 19 amino  was up to approximately 40% of the COD of the gelatine that was added. Protein hydrolysis at pH 5 was 2-25 times slower than at pH 7. Shifting the initial pH from neutral to acidic conditions (pH 5) inhibited protein degradation and changed the  (VFA) product profile. Furthermore, the presence or absence of methanogenic activity did not affect the rates of protein hydrolysis and acidification.The findings in this study can help to set a suitable solid retention time to accomplish anaerobic degradation of protein-rich wastewaters in continuous reactor systems. For example, if the target is harvesting VFAs, methanogens can be washed-out for a shorter retention time while amino acid fermentation, instead of hydrolysis as assumed previously, will govern the design and solutions to improve the system dealing with dissolved proteins.© The Author(s) 2019.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31694162>Changed Caecal Microbiota and Fermentation Contribute to the Beneficial Effects of Early Weaning with Alfalfa Hay, Starter Feed, and Milk Replacer on the Growth and Organ Development of Yak Calves.</a></h2><p>This study aimed to investigate the effect of early weaning by supplying calves with alfalfa hay, starter feed, and milk replacer on caecal bacterial communities and on the growth of pre-weaned yak calves. Ten 30-day-old male yak calves were randomly assigned to 2 groups. The maternal grazing (MG) group was maternally nursed and grazed, and the early weaning (EW) group was supplied milk replacer, starter feed, and alfalfa hay twice per day. Compared with the yak calves in the MG group, the yak calves in the EW group showed significantly increased body weight, body height, body length, and chest girth. When suffering to the potential mechanism of improved growth of yak calves, except for the enhanced ruminal fermentation, the significantly increased total , propionate, butyrate, isobutyrate, and valerate in the caecum in the EW group could also serve to promote the growth of calves. By using 16S rDNA sequencing, some significantly increased caecal phylum and genera, which were all related to the enhanced caecal fermentation by utilizing both the fibrous and non-fibrous carbohydrates, were identified in the EW group. In conclusion, early weaning of yak calves by supplying them with alfalfa hay, starter feed, and milk replacer is more beneficial to the growth of yak calves when compared with maternal grazing and nursing, in part due to alterations in caecal microbiota and fermentation.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31400787>Cross-resistance pattern to ACCase-inhibiting herbicides in a novel TrpLeu mutation American sloughgrass (Beckmannia syzigachne) population.</a></h2><p>The plastid acetyl coenzyme carboxylase (ACCase) TrpLeu mutation was identified in a Beckmannia syzigachne population resistant to fenoxaprop-p-ethyl. The pattern of cross-resistance for the TrpLeu mutation is still ambiguous. In this paper, mutant homozygote (1999Leu/Leu, RR) and wild type (1999Trp/Trp, SS) B. syzigachne plants with the same genetic background were purified from the JS-26 population using the dCAPS method. The activity of ACCase in RR and SS was determined. Then, the cross-resistance pattern to ACCase inhibiting herbicides of the TrpLeu mutation was determined using the whole-plant method. ACCase activity showed that the TrpLeu mutation decreased ACCase sensitivity to fenoxaprop-p-ethyl by 2.73-fold. A dose-response experiment indicated that the TrpLeu mutation conferred high resistance to quizalofop-p-ethyl (20.29-fold), metamifop (12.22-fold) and pinoxaden (18.60-fold), moderate resistance to fenoxaprop-p-ethyl (8.20-fold) and sethoxydim (6.38-fold), low resistance to cyhalofop-butyl (2.73-fold) and no resistance to clodinafop-propargyl (1.42 fold) and clethodim (1.59-fold).

We compared the intestinal fermentative capability of stunted and nonstunted ('healthy') children in southern India using two types of RS: high amylose maize starch (HAMS) and acetylated HAMS (HAMSA). Twenty children (10 stunted and 10 healthy) aged 2 to 5 years were fed biscuits containing HAMS (10 g/day) for two weeks followed by a 2-week washout and then HAMSA biscuits (10 g/day) for 2 weeks. Fecal samples were collected at 3-4 day intervals and pH and  analyzed. At entry, stunted children had lower  concentrations compared to healthy children. Both types of RS led to a significant decrease in fecal pH and increase in fecal acetate and propionate in both healthy and stunted children. However, while HAMS increased fecal butyrate in both groups of children, HAMSA increased butyrate in healthy but not stunted children. Furthermore, healthy children showed a significantly greater increase than stunted children in both acetate and butyrate when fed either RS. No adverse effects were reported with either RS. Stunted children have impaired capacity to ferment certain types of RS which has implications for choice of RS in formulations aimed at improving microbial function in stunted children.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31498864>Systematic Review and Meta-analysis: Short-Chain  Acid Characterization in Patients With Inflammatory Bowel Disease.</a></h2><p>Alterations in gut microbiota and short-chain   (SCFAs) have been reported in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), but the results are conflicting. The aim of this study was to perform a meta-analysis to explore the characterization of SCFAs in IBD patients and their potential role in the occurrence and development of IBD.Case-control studies investigating SCFAs in IBD patients were identified from several English databases.

The results indicated that a high stirring velocity gradient could cause sludge disintegration, which could not only shorten the fermentation time, but also increase the production of soluble chemical oxygen demand (SCOD) and  (VFAs) by 8.3% and 9.5%, respectively. Moreover, mechanical elutriation could also promote the release of SCOD from sludge to water, resulting in an increase in the yield of SCOD by 9.2%, it was observed that elutriation intensity plays a more important role than the elutriation time. The microbial community structure of the fermentation system was influenced by the stirring intensity. The relative abundance of fermentative bacteria in the reactor with a stirring intensity (G) of 160 s was 13.8%, which was significantly higher than that in the reactor with G = 31 s (8.037%), so the accumulation of VFAs and SCOD in the reactor with G = 160 s was improved.Copyright © 2019.

The CS was pretreated by water freezing-thawing (water-FT) and ammonia freezing-thawing (ammonia-FT), and then pretreated and untreated CS were anaerobically digested in three continuously stirred tank biodigesters (CSTBRs) at three organic loading rate (OLR) of 1.6, 1.8 and 2.0 gVS L d. The analyses showed that pH value and  (VFAs) concentration of three systems were in reasonable ranges of 6.8-7.5 and 160-330 mg L, respectively. Total ammonia nitrogen (TAN) in R3 system ranged from 600 mg L to 1300 mg L, which was conducive to maintain system stability. The removal amount of soluble chemical oxygen demand (SCOD) of CS by ammonia-FT pretreatment was 17.3-20.5% higher than that of water-FT pretreatment. The results also showed that CS pretreated by ammonia-FT achieved 27.8-32.4% and 13.9-16.1% more methane yield (250-267 mL g) than those of untreated and water-FT pretreatment, respectively. Correspondingly, ammonia-FT pretreated CS in R3 obtained the highest conversion rates of 47.7%, 56.9%, 42.7%, and 48.8% for TS, VS, cellulose, and hemicellulose, respectively, and the lowest cost was of 0.0336 USD m CH and the highest energy recovery of 2428.1 kWh kg.

Tanker milk from 55 groups of farms (264 farms in total) in France, Slovakia, and Slovenia was collected twice during the indoor season and 3 times during the outdoor season. The tanker rounds were selected in each country to be balanced according to their origin (lowland or upland) and within upland or lowland groups, according to the forage systems: corn-based or grass-based forage system. At each milk sampling, the production conditions were recorded through on-farm surveys. The milk was analyzed for gross composition, carotenoids, minerals,  , phenolic compound derivatives,  organic compound concentrations, and color. The milk from upland and lowland areas differed in their contents of a few constituents. Upland milk was richer in not identified (n.i.) retention time (Rt) 13,59, 4-methylpentylbenzene, 1-methyl-2-n-hexylbenzene, and β-caryophyllene than lowland milk. These differences could be most likely attributable to the utilization of highly diversified and extensively managed semi-natural grasslands. The higher forbs content of upland pastures could be related as well to the richness in C18:3n-3, CLA cis-9,trans-11, MUFA, and PUFA we observed in upland compared with lowland milk during the outdoor season. In contrast, grazing on lowland pastures rich in grasses gave a yellower milk that was richer in β-carotene. Out of the few compounds showing a significant effect of origin or its interaction, most of the milk constituents were unaffected by the origin at all. However, almost all milk constituents differed according to the forage system and the season, and the differences observed between seasons can be attributed to differences in the cow diet composition.Copyright © 2019 American Dairy Science Association.

We hypothesized that intestinal microbiota changes may mediate these effects, and this study aims to prove this hypothesis. Mice were fed a normal diet (ND, 0.86% methionine + 4% fat), a HF diet (HFD, 0.86% methionine + 20% fat), or a MRD (0.17% methionine + 20% fat) and euthanized at week 22. Our results showed that the HFD induced fat accumulation and gut microbiota dysbiosis; reduced short-chain  acid () production; and increased intestinal permeability, inflammatory response, and oxidative stress. The MRD decreased the body weight, body fat rate, and blood glucose and plasma lipid levels; increased the abundance of putative -producing bacteria Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus, Bacteroides, Roseburia, Coprococcus, and Ruminococcus and inflammation-inhibiting bacteria Oscillospira and Corynebacterium; and decreased the abundance of inflammation-producing bacteria Desulfovibrio in colonic contents. Moreover, the MRD improved intestinal barrier function, inflammatory response, and oxidative stress, and altered the metabolite levels of colonic contents (such as increasing  and bile acid concentrations); the latter may have contributed to the prevention of HFD-induced obesity. In conclusion, the MRD can improve gut health by regulating the intestinal microbiota and its metabolite profiles in the HFD mice.

Four dietary supplementation treatments were imposed; non-supplementation (control, T1); supplementation of RP fed at 2% of DMI (low, T2); supplementation of RP fed at 4% of DMI (medium, T3) and supplementation of RP fed at 6% of DMI (high, T4). All cattle were given a concentrate supplement at 1 % of body weight while Napier grass was provided as a free choice.The findings revealed that RP supplementation did not negatively affect (P>0.05) DM intake of Napier grass, while RP intake and total DMI were the greatest in the RP supplementation at 4 and 6%DMI. Nevertheless, the nutrients (DM, OM, CP, NDF and ADF) digestibilities were not changed in the RP supplementation groups. Rumen fermentation parameters especially those of total , acetate and butyrate were not significantly changed.

Mass spectrometry-based metabolomic approach was applied to investigate the differences in  and non- metabolite profiles of fermented soybeans by different microorganisms [e.g., molds, yeasts, lactic acid bacteria (LAB), and other bacteria]. The partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) for  metabolites profiles indicated that the fungi group (mold/yeast) was clearly discriminated from the bacteria group (bacteria/LAB). The metabolic pathways related to the formation of  metabolites also differed according to microorganisms. In particular, the formation of branched-chain aliphatic alcohols and esters increased in the fungi group, while that of volatiles derived from   was superior in the bacteria group. In addition, we could determine the microorganism-specific metabolites using a correlation network analysis. This study can provide the fundamental knowledge on the metabolic differences according to the type of microorganisms in fermented soybeans.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The protective mechanism of SCFAs against CRC has been described in three aspects: epigenetics, immunology and molecular signalling pathways. Many food and plant extracts that were fermented by microorganisms produced SCFAs that play positive roles with preventive and therapeutic effects on CRC. The "food-microorganism-SCFAs" axis was constructed by summarizing the pertinent literature.This study provides insight into the basic research and practical application of SCFAs by assessing the protective effect of SCFAs on CRC.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31574836>Efficacy of montelukast for the treatment of pediatric allergic purpura.</a></h2><p>This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of montelukast for the treatment of patients with pediatric allergic purpura (PAP).We will retrieve the following electronic databases from inception to the present: MEDILINE, Embase, CENTRAL, CINAHL, AMED, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, China National Knowledge Infrastructure Database, Wanfang, and VIP database without language limitation.

The ability of these products to modulate the microbial community was studied simulating a daily intake for nine days. Microbial functionality, investigated in terms of short chain   () and NH, was stable during the treatment. A significant increase in  and  at nine days was induced by OP mainly in the proximal tract. Polyphenol metabolism indicated the formation of tyrosol from OP mainly in the distal tract, while urolithins C and A were produced from PM, identifying the human donor as a metabotype A.

The obtained results indicated that the reflux of biogas slurry increased both the pH of the acid-producing phase and acetic acid yield and repeatedly degraded the refractory organic matter in the biogas slurry. The larger reflux ratio increased the inoculation volume and substantially enhanced the mass transfer process. The maximum values of the biogas and methane yields equal to 259.49 and 167.44 mL/g  solids, respectively, were achieved at a reflux ratio of 100%. Moreover, the weight of the PM leachate residue was reduced by 94.14%, and the total nutrient content (N + PO + KO) was relatively high (1.48%), which was suitable for vegetable seedling substrates. In conclusion, during the treatment of PM in LBR-CSTRs, the solid phase remains on the leach bed, and the leachate is supplied to a biogas tank, which effectively increases its stability of operation.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Molasses were freshly fermented or 3-months lees aged. Batch (PS: Pot Still) or continuous (CS: Coffey Still) distillation was carried out resulting in four different rum distillates. Gas chromatography and 3D-fluorescence enabled to differentiate rum distillates chemical composition according to the distillation process, regardless of the ageing on lees of fermented molasses. Differences in fluorescent PARAFAC components and  , acetals and carbonyls contents revealed the predominance of the physicochemical processes driven at the liquid-vapor interface of fermented molasses, generated by the distillation systems. Notwithstanding the distilling conditions, the long chain  ester content was significantly higher in the 3-months lees aged condition. Multivariate analysis highlighted that CS rum distillates were chemically more homogeneous than those obtained by PS that preserved the lees effect.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Thus two bioaugmentation inocula (an enriched culture, and a mixed culture composed 50/50 by Methanoculleus thermophilus and the enriched culture) on the recovery of ammonia-inhibited thermophilic continuous reactors was assessed. The results showed that bioaugmentation improved methane yield by 11-13% and decreased the  (VFA) by 45-52% compared to the control reactor (abiotic augmentation). Moreover, the importance of hydrogenotrophic methanogens to a fast and successful bioaugmentation was recognized. Specifically, the instant hydrogen partial pressure reduction by the bioaugmented hydrogenotroph created thermodynamically favourable conditions for the acetate oxidation process and consequently, the catabolism of other VFA. High-throughput sequencing results strengthened this explanation by showing that the bioaugmented M. thermophilus stimulated the growth of syntrophic acetate oxidising bacterium Thermacetogenium phaeum, immediately after bioaugmentation.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The results indicated that the highest hydrolysis rate was obtained at pH of 12 (52.62%) leading to the highest production of soluble chemical oxygen demand (SCOD) and soluble protein (SP). The highest acidification rate was observed at pH of 10 (32.15%), leading to the highest production of  (VFAs). At pH of 10, average sludge size reduced by 24.60%, and the proportion of biodegradable dissolved organic matter (DOM) produced by synergistic system increased by 15.82%, when compared with those of raw sludge. Moreover, results of 16S rRNA clearly validated that the relative abundance of hydrolytic and acidogenic microbes (e.g. Tepidimicrobium, Coprothermobacter) abundantly enriched at pH of 10 (49.88%) was greatly higher than others, which was the main reason for its maximum VFAs accumulation.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Glomerulosclerosis, tubulointerstitial fibrosis, and persistent intestinal flora disturbance are common in CKD. Short-chain   (SCFAs), produced by the intestinal microbiota, have been previously reported to ameliorate kidney injury; however, the specific concentrations and types that are required to improve renal function remain unknown. The present study aims to evaluate the levels of SCFAs in healthy and CKD patients, and to test the hypothesis that SCFAs play a critical role in delaying CKD progression. One hundred and twenty-seven patients with CKD and 63 healthy controls from China were enrolled in the present study. Butyrate, which is considered beneficial to humans, was almost three-times higher in healthy volunteers than that in CKD5 subjects (=0.001). Moreover, the serum  levels in controls were significantly higher than that in CKD patients (<0.05), and the butyrate level among CKD5 patients (1.48 ± 0.60 μmol/l) was less than half of that in controls (3.44 ± 2.12 μmol/l, <0.001). In addition, we observed an inverse correlation between butyrate level and renal function (<0.05). A CKD rat model transplanted with microbiota obtained from CKD patients exhibited accelerated CKD progression via increased production of trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), which was reversed by supplementation with extra butyrate. Our results showed that  levels were reduced in CKD patients and that butyrate supplementation might delay CKD progression.© 2019 The Author(s).

This study investigated bio-reduction of vanadate coupled with anaerobic methane oxidation and its relationship with nitrate reduction. Results showed 95.8 ± 3.1% of 1 mM vanadate was removed within 7 days using methane as the sole electron donor. Tetravalent vanadium compounds were the main reduction products, which precipitated naturally in groundwater environment. The introduction of nitrate inhibited vanadate reduction, though both were reduced in parallel. Accumulations of  (VFAs) were observed from methane oxidation.

In total nine Halomonas strains were experimentally screened for their capability of PHA production. Among them, Halomonas neptunia and Halomonas hydrothermalis were identified as potent PHA producers. Initial concentration of NaCl was identified as parameter influencing PHA yields as well as molecular weight of the polymer. In addition, H. hydrothermalis was capable of biosynthesis of a copolymer of 3-hydroxybutyrate and 3-hydroxyvalerate P(3HB-co-3HV). When valerate was utilized as a precursor, the 3HV fraction in the copolymer reached high values of 50.15 mol.%. PHA production on lipid substrates by Halomonas has not been reported so far. Bearing in mind all the positive aspects of employing extremophiles in industrial biotechnology, H. hydrothermalis seems to be a very interesting halophilic strain for production of PHA using lipid substrates.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Species-dependent congener distribution patterns were firstly reported for perfluorocarboxylic  (PFCAs) and perfluoroalkyl sulfonic  (PFSAs). The majority of PFSAs and PFCAs in Chinese red pine bark were C5-C7 PFSAs and perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA, containing six carbon atoms, C6), whereas perfluorobutanesulfonic acid (PFBS, C4) and longer chain congeners (PFCAs: C ≥ 7; PFSAs: C ≥ 8) took a larger proportion in the fissured bark from Canadian poplar, Chinese scholartree and weeping willow. The species-dependent congener profiles depended on the structures and chemical compositions of tree bark, as well as the translocation of PFASs within plants. Different tree bark characteristics caused different retention abilities for particle-bound and gaseous PFASs. Particle-bound PFASs retained in the rougher structures of fissured bark led to preferential retention of long chain congeners (the major fraction in the particle phase), while lipid-rich Chinese red pine bark retained more gaseous PFASs (mainly short chain congeners). Besides, the abundance of short chain PFASs in red pine bark was consistent with the chain length-dependent translocation behaviors of PFASs in various plants, suggesting that translocation of PFASs within plants to tree bark may be invovled.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Gut microbiota may play a regulatory role in gastrointestinal health, substrate metabolism, and peripheral tissues including adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, liver, and pancreas via its metabolites short-chain   (). Animal and human data demonstrated that, in particular, acetate beneficially affects host energy and substrate metabolism via secretion of the gut hormones like glucagon-like peptide-1 and peptide YY, which, thereby, affects appetite, via a reduction in whole-body lipolysis, systemic pro-inflammatory cytokine levels, and via an increase in energy expenditure and fat oxidation. Thus, potential therapies to increase gut microbial fermentation and acetate production have been under vigorous scientific scrutiny. In this review, the relevance of the colonically and systemically most abundant  acetate and its effects on the previously mentioned tissues will be discussed in relation to body weight control and glucose homeostasis. We discuss in detail the differential effects of oral acetate administration (vinegar intake), colonic acetate infusions, acetogenic fiber, and acetogenic probiotic administrations as approaches to combat obesity and comorbidities. Notably, human data are scarce, which highlights the necessity for further human research to investigate acetate's role in host physiology, metabolic, and cardiovascular health.</p><h2><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31680139>Effects of copper hydroxychloride and distillers dried grains with solubles on intestinal microbial concentration and apparent ileal and total tract digestibility of energy and nutrients by growing pigs.</a></h2><p>An experiment was conducted to test the hypothesis that Cu hydroxychloride improves nutrient digestibility and alters the concentration of microbial protein in the small intestine or large intestine by pigs fed a corn-soybean meal diet or a diet based on corn, soybean meal, and distillers dried grains with solubles (DDGS). Twenty four barrows (33.3 ± 3.4 kg) that had a T-cannula installed in the distal ileum, were allotted to a 2 × 2 factorial design with 2 levels of DDGS (0 or 45%) and 2 levels of supplemental Cu from Cu hydroxychloride (0 or 150 mg/kg). A 2-period switch back design with the 4 diets and 6 replicate pigs per diet in each period was used resulting in 12 replicate pigs per diet for the 2 periods. The initial 9 d of each period was considered an adaptation period to the experimental diets. For each period, feces were collected on d 10, 11, and 12, and ileal digesta were collected for 8 h on d 13 and 14. Results indicated that inclusion of 45% DDGS to diets reduced (P < 0.05) the apparent ileal digestibility (AID) of AA and the AID and the apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) of dry matter, gross energy, and crude protein. In contrast, inclusion of DDGS to diets increased (P < 0.05) the AID and the ATTD of acid hydrolyzed ether extract and the concentration of microbial protein in the hindgut (P < 0.05). However, the total concentration of  (VFA) in ileal digesta and in feces from pigs fed the DDGS diets were not different from concentrations in pigs fed diets without DDGS. The AID and ATTD of dry matter, gross energy and crude protein were not affected by dietary Cu concentrations, but the AID and ATTD of acid hydrolyzed ether extract were greater (P < 0.05) in diets supplemented with Cu hydroxychloride compared with diets without Cu hydroxychloride. There was also a reduction (P < 0.05) in the concentration of microbial protein and a tendency for a reduction (P < 0.10) in the total concentration of VFA in feces when diets were supplemented with Cu hydroxychloride. In conclusion, supplementation of Cu hydroxychloride to diets improved AID and ATTD of acid hydrolyzed ether extract and reduced the concentration of microbial protein in the large intestine and this effect was observed in diets containing DDGS as well as in diets without DDGS.© The Author(s) 2019.

The objective of this study was to investigate the relationship among layer breed, microbial structure and odor production.Thirty Hy-Line Gray and thirty Lohmann Pink laying hens were used in this study to determine the impact of cecal microbial structure on odor production of laying hens. The hens were managed under the same husbandry and dietary regimes. Results of in vivo experiments showed a lower hydrogen sulfide (HS) production from Hy-Line hens and a lower concentration of soluble sulfide (S) but a higher concentration of butyrate in the cecal content of the Hy-Line hens compared to Lohmann Pink hens (P < 0.05), which was consistent with the in vitro experiments (P < 0.05). However, ammonia (NH) production was not different between genotypes (P > 0.05). Significant microbial structural differences existed between the two breed groups. The relative abundance of some butyrate producers (including Butyricicoccus, Butyricimonas and Roseburia) and sulfate-reducing bacteria (including Mailhella and Lawsonia) were found to be significantly correlated with odor production and were shown to be different in the 16S rRNA and PCR data between two breed groups. Furthermore, some bacterial metabolism pathways associated with energy extraction and carbohydrate utilization (oxidative phosphorylation, pyruvate metabolism, energy metabolism, two component system and secretion system) were overrepresented in the Hy-Line hens, while several amino acid metabolism-associated pathways (amino acid related enzymes, arginine and proline metabolism, and alanine-aspartate and glutamate metabolism) were more prevalent in the Lohmann hens.The results of this study suggest that genotype of laying hens influence cecal microbiota, which in turn modulates their odor production.

With a sample volume of 500 μL, optimal conditions were achieved by allowing the sample to equilibrate for 10 min at 50 °C and then extracting the samples for 10 min at the same temperature, using a carboxen/polydimethylsiloxane fibre. The method allowed the simultaneous identification and quantification of 20 compounds in sample headspace, including short-chain   and their derivatives which are commonly analysed after analyte derivatization. The proof of applicability of the methodology was performed with a case study regarding the analysis of the dynamics of  metabolites in saliva of a single subject undergoing 5-day treatment with rifaximin antibiotic. Non-stimulated saliva samples were collected over 3 weeks from a nominally healthy volunteer before, during, and after antibiotic treatment. The variations of some metabolites, known to be produced by the microbiota and by bacteria that are susceptible to antibiotics, suggest that the study of the dynamics of salivary metabolites can be an excellent indirect method for analysing the gut microbiota. This approach is novel from an analytical standpoint, and it encourages further studies combining saliva metabolite profiles and gut microbiota dynamics.

Optimization of extraction conditions by a central composite experimental design revealed that the dilution of the alcohol content of 5 mL of Baijiu to 10%, followed by the addition of 1.5 g of NaCl and subsequent SPME Arrow extraction with DVB/CAR/PDMS fiber coating over 45 min at 45 °C was the most suitable. The quantitative method allowed the extraction and identification of 82 aroma compounds (esters, alcohols,  , aldehydes & ketones, furans, pyrazines, sulfur compounds, phenols, terpenes, and lactones) in the Baijiu sample. The method was validated with good repeatability, inter and intra-day precision (almost below 15%), and accuracy (almost in the range of 81.5-119.96%). Furthermore, the method was validated successfully for the most significant compounds and was applied to study the composition of  compounds in different types of Baijiu. This research proved that SPME Arrow is an effective method for the extraction of aroma compounds in Baijiu and other distilled spirits.
