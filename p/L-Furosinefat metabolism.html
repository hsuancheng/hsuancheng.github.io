Currently, traditional chemotherapeutics are often combined with targeted biologic agents. These biologics, however, possess a distinct toxicity profile, and they may also exacerbate the adverse effects of traditional chemotherapeutics. In this study, we aimed to characterize the gastrointestinal and metabolic changes after a 2-week treatment period with aflibercept, an antiangiogenic VEGFR decoy, and with erlotinib, a -kinase inhibitor. Male rats were treated either with aflibercept or erlotinib for 2 weeks. During the 2-week treatment period, the animals in the aflibercept group received two subcutaneous doses of 25 mg/kg aflibercept. The erlotinib group got 10 mg/kg of erlotinib by oral gavage every other day. The control groups were treated similarly but received either saline injections or oral gavage of water. Intestinal toxicity was assessed by measuring intestinal permeability and by histological analyses of intestinal tissues. Metabolic changes were measured with H nuclear magnetic resonance in serum and urine. Neither aflibercept nor erlotinib induced changes in intestinal permeability or intestinal tissue morphology. However, aflibercept treatment resulted in stunted body weight gain and altered choline, amino acid, and . Two-week treatment with aflibercept or erlotinib alone does not induce observable changes in gastrointestinal morphology and function. However, observed aflibercept-treatment related metabolic changes suggest alterations in intestinal microbiota, nutrient intake, and adipose tissue function. The metabolic changes are also interesting in respect to the systemic effects of aflibercept and their possible associations with adverse events caused by aflibercept administration.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

The treatment of rats with melanin along with GNPs induced dramatic changes in all the measured biochemical parameters. Our data demonstrated that melanin completely inhibited inflammatory liver damage, oxidative stress, and  peroxidation, which was confirmed by the histological investigation of different liver sections stained by H&E.These results suggest the beneficial use of melanin together with GNPs for alleviating its toxicity. Other studies should be implemented taking into consideration the role of melanin in comparison with other natural antioxidants.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30098557>Non-targeted metabolomics reveals alterations in liver and plasma of gilt-head bream exposed to oxybenzone.</a></h1><p>The extensive use of the organic UV filter oxybenzone has led to its ubiquitous occurrence in the aquatic environment, causing an ecotoxicological risk to biota. Although some studies reported adverse effects, such as reproductive toxicity, further research needs to be done in order to assess its molecular effects and mechanism of action. Therefore, in the present work, we investigated metabolic perturbations in juvenile gilt-head bream (Sparus aurata) exposed over 14 days via the water to oxybenzone (50 mg/L). The non-targeted analysis of brain, liver and plasma extracts was performed by means of UHPLC-qOrbitrap MS in positive and negative modes with both C18 and HILIC separation. Although there was no mortality or alterations in general physiological parameters during the experiment, and the metabolic profile of brain was not affected, the results of this study showed that oxybenzone could perturb both liver and plasma metabolome. The pathway enrichment suggested that different pathways in  (fatty acid elongation, α-linolenic acid , biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids and fatty acid ) were significantly altered, as well as metabolites involved in phenylalanine and  . Overall, these changes are signs of possible oxidative stress and energy  modification. Therefore, this research indicates that oxybenzone has adverse effects beyond the commonly studied hormonal activity, and demonstrates the sensitivity of metabolomics to assess molecular-level effects of emerging contaminants.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Recent studies have shown that both are exerted robustly in rodents and humans. If intact, these functions exert beneficial effects on obesity and diabetes, respectively. Disruption of both occurs due to a condition known as hypothalamic insulin resistance, which is caused by obesity and the overconsumption of saturated . An enormous volume of literature addresses the molecular mechanisms of hypothalamic insulin resistance. IKKβ and JNK are major players in the inflammation pathway, which is activated by saturated fatty acids that induce hypothalamic insulin resistance. Two major  phosphatases, PTP-1B and TCPTP, are upregulated in chronic overeating. They dephosphorylate the insulin receptor and insulin receptor substrate proteins, resulting in hypothalamic insulin resistance. Prolonged hyperinsulinemia with excessive nutrition activates the mTOR/S6 kinase pathway, thereby enhancing IRS-1 serine phosphorylation to induce hypothalamic insulin resistance. Other mechanisms associated with this condition include hypothalamic gliosis and disturbed insulin transport into the central nervous system. Unveiling the precise molecular mechanisms involved in hypothalamic insulin resistance is important for developing new ways of treating obesity and type 2 diabetes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29875329>The Multifaceted Role of STAT3 in Mammary Gland Involution and Breast Cancer.</a></h1><p>Since seminal descriptions of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) as a signal transducer and transcriptional regulator, which is most usually activated by phosphorylation of a specific  residue, a staggering wealth of research has delineated the key role of this transcription factor as a mediator of mammary gland postlactational regression (involution), and paradoxically, a pro-survival factor in breast cancer and some breast cancer cell lines. STAT3 is a critical regulator of lysosomal-mediated programmed cell death (LM-PCD) during mammary gland involution, where uptake of milk  globules, and consequent high levels of free fatty acids, cause permeabilisation of lysosomal vesicle membranes, in turn leading to cathepsin protease leakage and cell death. A recent proteomic screen of STAT3-induced changes in lysosomal membrane protein components has highlighted wide-ranging effects of STAT3, which may coordinate LM-PCD via the stimulation of endocytosis, intracellular trafficking, and lysosome biogenesis. In parallel, STAT3 regulates the acute phase response during the first phase of involution, and it contributes to shaping the pro-tumourigenic 'wound healing' signature of the gland during the second phase of this process. STAT3 activation during involution is important across species, although some differences exist in the progression of involution in dairy cows. In breast cancer, a number of upstream regulators can lead to STAT3 activation and the effects of phosphorylation of STAT3 are equally wide-ranging. Recent studies have implicated microRNAs in some regulatory pathways. In this review, we will examine the multifaceted role of STAT3 in mammary gland involution and tumourigenesis, incorporating a review of these fundamental processes in tandem with a discussion of recent developments in this field.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30165790>In vitro and in vivo phosphorylation of the Ca2.3 voltage-gated R-type calcium channel.</a></h1><p>During the recording of whole cell currents from stably transfected HEK-293 cells, the decline of currents carried by the recombinant human Cav2.3+β3 channel subunits is related to adenosine triphosphate (ATP) depletion after rupture of the cells. It reduces the number of functional channels and leads to a progressive shift of voltage-dependent gating to more negative potentials (Neumaier F., et al., 2018). Both effects can be counteracted by hydrolysable ATP, whose protective action is almost completely prevented by inhibition of serine/threonine but not  or  kinases. These findings indicate that ATP promotes phosphorylation of either the channel or an associated protein, whereas dephosphorylation during cell dialysis results in run-down. Protein phosphorylation is required for Ca2.3 channel function and could directly influence the normal features of current carried by these channels. Therefore, results from in vitro and in vivo phosphorylation of Ca2.3 are summarized to come closer to a functional analysis of structural variations in Ca2.3 splice variants.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30528881>Downregulation of EDTP in glial cells suppresses polyglutamine protein aggregates and extends lifespan in Drosophila melanogaster.</a></h1><p>Drosophila egg-derived  phosphatase (EDTP) is a  phosphatase essential for oogenesis and muscle function. Loss-of-EDTP is lethal at early developmental stages. Hypomorphic mutation of EDTP causes impaired muscle performance and shortened lifespan. Mutation of MTMR14, a mammalian homolog to EDTP, is associated with muscle fatigue in rodents and a rare genetic disease called centronuclear myopathy in humans. Despite the deleterious consequences, downregulation of MTMR14 promotes autophagy. It is proposed that selective downregulation of EDTP/MTMR14 in non-muscle tissues improves the survivorship to cellular wastes and extends lifespan. Here, we show that downregulation of EDTP in glial cells suppressed the expression of polyglutamine (polyQ) protein aggregates and improved survival. Downregulation of EDTP in glial cells also extended lifespan. These effects were not observed by targeting pan-neurons in the nervous system, suggesting the significance of tissue-specificity. Additionally, flies carrying an EDTP mutant had increased survival to prolonged anoxia and altered dynamics of polyQ expression. These data supported the proposal that selective downregulation of EDTP in non-muscle tissues improved survivorship to cellular protein aggregates and extended lifespan. Our findings suggest that EDTP/MTMR14 could be a novel molecular target for the treatment of neurodegeneration.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

These reactive species participate in redox reactions leading to oxidative modifications in biomolecules, among which proteins and lipids are preferential targets. Despite a broad array of enzymatic and nonenzymatic antioxidant systems in mammalian cells and microbes, excess oxidant formation causes accumulation of new products that may compromise cell function and structure leading to cell degeneration and death. Oxidative events are associated with pathological conditions and the process of normal aging. Notably, physiological levels of oxidants also modulate cellular functions via homeostatic redox-sensitive cell signaling cascades. On the other hand, nitric oxide (NO), a free radical and weak oxidant, represents a master physiological regulator via reversible interactions with heme proteins. The bioavailability and actions of NO are modulated by its fast reaction with superoxide radical ([Formula: see text]), which yields an unusual and reactive peroxide, peroxynitrite, representing the merging of the oxygen radicals and NO pathways. In this Inaugural Article, I summarize early and remarkable developments in free radical biochemistry and the later evolution of the field toward molecular medicine; this transition includes our contributions disclosing the relationship of NO with redox intermediates and . The biochemical characterization, identification, and quantitation of peroxynitrite and its role in disease processes have concentrated much of our attention. Being a mediator of protein oxidation and nitration,  peroxidation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and cell death, peroxynitrite represents both a pathophysiologically relevant endogenous cytotoxin and a cytotoxic effector against invading pathogens.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29785010>Genome-wide analyses identify 68 new loci associated with intraocular pressure and improve risk prediction for primary open-angle glaucoma.</a></h1><p>Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness globally  . Despite its gravity, the disease is frequently undiagnosed in the community  . Raised intraocular pressure (IOP) is the most important risk factor for primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG). Here we present a meta-analysis of 139,555 European participants, which identified 112 genomic loci associated with IOP, 68 of which are novel. These loci suggest a strong role for angiopoietin-receptor  kinase signaling, , mitochondrial function and developmental processes underlying risk for elevated IOP. In addition, 48 of these loci were nominally associated with glaucoma in an independent cohort, 14 of which were significant at a Bonferroni-corrected threshold. Regression-based glaucoma-prediction models had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.76 in US NEIGHBORHOOD study participants and 0.74 in independent glaucoma cases from the UK Biobank. Genetic-prediction models for POAG offer an opportunity to target screening and timely therapy to individuals most at risk.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30217817>Fibroblast growth factor receptor 5 (FGFR5) is a co-receptor for FGFR1 that is up-regulated in beta-cells by cytokine-induced inflammation.</a></h1><p>Fibroblast growth factor receptor-1 (FGFR1) activity at the plasma membrane is tightly controlled by the availability of co-receptors and competing receptor isoforms. We have previously shown that FGFR1 activity in pancreatic beta-cells modulates a wide range of processes, including , insulin processing, and cell survival. More recently, we have revealed that co-expression of FGFR5, a receptor isoform that lacks a -kinase domain, influences FGFR1 responses. We therefore hypothesized that FGFR5 is a co-receptor to FGFR1 that modulates responses to ligands by forming a receptor heterocomplex with FGFR1. We first show here increased FGFR5 expression in the pancreatic islets of nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice and also in mouse and human islets treated with proinflammatory cytokines. Using siRNA knockdown, we further report that FGFR5 and FGFR1 expression improves beta-cell survival. Co-immunoprecipitation and quantitative live-cell imaging to measure the molecular interaction between FGFR5 and FGFR1 revealed that FGFR5 forms a mixture of ligand-independent homodimers (∼25%) and homotrimers (∼75%) at the plasma membrane. Interestingly, co-expressed FGFR5 and FGFR1 formed heterocomplexes with a 2:1 ratio and subsequently responded to FGF2 by forming FGFR5/FGFR1 signaling complexes with a 4:2 ratio. Taken together, our findings identify FGFR5 as a co-receptor that is up-regulated by inflammation and promotes FGFR1-induced survival, insights that reveal a potential target for intervention during beta-cell pathogenesis.© 2018 Regeenes et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30937130>H NMR-based metabolomic study of metabolic profiling for pollinosis.</a></h1><p>Allergic rhinitis is the main symptom of pollinosis, relieved by non-specific treatment universally.

The high frequency of PI3K pathway mutations in many cancers has encouraged a new field targeting cancer driver mutations. Although there have been many successes, targeting PI3K itself has proven challenging, in part because of its multiple isoforms with distinct roles. Despite promising preclinical results, development of PI3K inhibitors as pharmacologic anticancer agents has been limited by modest single-agent efficacy and significant adverse effects. If we could overcome these limitations, PI3K inhibitors would be a powerful cancer-fighting tool. Data from phase III clinical trials yields insight into some of the problems with PI3K inhibitors. Recent advances have shed light on the mechanisms of tumor resistance to PI3K inhibitors via feedback pathways that cause elevated insulin levels that then activate the same PI3K pathways that are the targets of inhibition. Improving our understanding of the complex regulatory feedback pathways that activate in response to PI3K inhibition will reveal ways to increase the efficacy of PI3K inhibitors and reduce adverse effects, increasing the usefulness of this class as a treatment option for multiple cancer types.Copyright © 2019 Paddock et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30354245>Palmitoylethanolamide Promotes a Proresolving Macrophage Phenotype and Attenuates Atherosclerotic Plaque Formation.</a></h1><p>Objective- Palmitoylethanolamide is an endogenous fatty acid mediator that is synthetized from membrane phospholipids by N-acyl phosphatidylethanolamine phospholipase D. Its biological actions are primarily mediated by PPAR-α (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors α) and the orphan receptor GPR55. Palmitoylethanolamide exerts potent anti-inflammatory actions but its physiological role and promise as a therapeutic agent in chronic arterial inflammation, such as atherosclerosis remain unexplored. Approach and Results- First, the polarization of mouse primary macrophages towards a proinflammatory phenotype was found to reduce N-acyl phosphatidylethanolamine phospholipase D expression and palmitoylethanolamide bioavailability. N-acyl phosphatidylethanolamine phospholipase D expression was progressively downregulated in the aorta of apolipoprotein E deficient (ApoE) mice during atherogenesis. N-acyl phosphatidylethanolamine phospholipase D mRNA levels were also downregulated in unstable human plaques and they positively associated with smooth muscle cell markers and negatively with macrophage markers. Second, ApoE mice were fed a high- diet for 4 or 16 weeks and treated with either vehicle or palmitoylethanolamide (3 mg/kg per day, 4 weeks) to study the effects of palmitoylethanolamide on early established and pre-established atherosclerosis. Palmitoylethanolamide treatment reduced plaque size in early atherosclerosis, whereas in pre-established atherosclerosis, palmitoylethanolamide promoted signs of plaque stability as evidenced by reduced macrophage accumulation and necrotic core size, increased collagen deposition and downregulation of M1-type macrophage markers. Mechanistically, we found that palmitoylethanolamide, by activating GPR55, increases the expression of the phagocytosis receptor MerTK (proto-oncogene -protein kinase MER) and enhances macrophage efferocytosis, indicative of proresolving properties. Conclusions- The present study demonstrates that palmitoylethanolamide protects against atherosclerosis by promoting an anti-inflammatory and proresolving phenotype of lesional macrophages, representing a new therapeutic approach to resolve arterial inflammation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30683649>A double-hit pre-eclampsia model results in sex-specific growth restriction patterns.</a></h1><p>Pre-eclampsia is a multifactorial pregnancy-associated disorder characterized by angiogenic dysbalance and systemic inflammation; however, animal models that combine these two pathophysiological conditions are missing. Here, we introduce a novel double-hit pre-eclampsia mouse model that mimics the complex multifactorial conditions present during pre-eclampsia and allows for the investigation of early consequences for the fetus. Adenoviral overexpression of soluble fms-like  kinase (sFlt-1) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration at mid-gestation in pregnant mice resulted in hypertension and albuminuria comparable to that of the manifestation in humans. A metabolomics analysis revealed that pre-eclamptic dams have increased plasma concentrations of phosphadytilcholines. The fetuses of both sexes were growth restricted; however, in males a brain-sparing effect was seen as compensation for this growth restriction. According to the plasma metabolomics, male fetuses showed changes in amino acid , while female fetuses showed pronounced alterations in . Our results show that combined exposure to sFlt-1 and LPS mimics the clinical symptoms of pre-eclampsia and affects fetal growth in a sex-specific manner, with accompanying metabolome changes.© 2019.

Here, we show that tocopherols (vitamin E), -soluble antioxidants synthesized from  in chloroplasts, positively regulate the biogenesis of miRNAs. Tocopherols are required for the accumulation of 3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphate (PAP), a retrograde inhibitor of the nuclear exoribonucleases (XRN), which may protect primary miRNAs from being degraded and promote mature miRNA production. Such regulation is involved in heat-induced accumulation of miR398 and plant acquisition of heat tolerance. Our study reveals a chloroplast-to-nucleus signaling mechanism that favors miRNA biogenesis under heat and possibly other environmental perturbations.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Although numerous functions of the polarity protein AF6 (afadin and MLLT4) have been identified, a direct effect on insulin sensitivity has not been previously described. We show that AF6 is elevated in the liver tissues of dietary and genetic mouse models of diabetes. We generated liver-specific AF6 knockout mice and show that these animals exhibit enhanced insulin sensitivity and liver glycogen storage, whereas overexpression of AF6 in wild-type mice by adenovirus-expressing AF6 led to the opposite phenotype. Similar observations were obtained from in vitro studies. In addition, we discovered that AF6 directly regulates IRS1/AKT kinase-mediated insulin signaling through its interaction with Src homology 2 domain-containing phosphatase 2 (SHP2) and its regulation of SHP2's  phosphatase activity. Finally, we show that knockdown of hepatic AF6 ameliorates hyperglycemia and insulin resistance in high- diet-fed or  diabetic mice. These results demonstrate a novel function for hepatic AF6 in the regulation of insulin sensitivity, providing important insights about the metabolic role of AF6.© 2019 by the American Diabetes Association.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29851303>High sucrose low copper diet in pregnant diabetic rats induces transient oxidative stress, hypoxia, and apoptosis in the offspring's liver.</a></h1><p>Hyperglycemia-related oxidative stress and hypoxia are important mechanisms responsible for diabetes-induced embryopathy and other complications. High sucrose low copper diet (HSD), but not regular diet (RD), induces type 2 diabetes in the inbred Cohen diabetic sensitive (CDs) rats but not in the Sabra control rats. We recently demonstrated long-term changes of DNA methylation and gene expression in various groups of genes, including genes involved in oxidant-antioxidant activity in the liver of 2-4-week-old CDs offspring of diabetic dams. We now studied the postnatal effects of diabetes and/or HSD on several liver metabolic parameters in these offspring.we studied  peroxidation, activity of the antioxidants enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD) and Catalase (CAT). By immunohistochemistry: protein oxidation by nitrotyrosine staining, hypoxia inducing factor1α (HIF1α), apoptosis [caspase 3, bcl-2-like protein (BAX)], proliferation [proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)] and NF-κB.In the Sabra rats fed HSD only few, early and transitional changes were observed in  peroxidation, SOD and CAT activity. In the CDs fed HSD more significant changes in  and protein oxidation, HIF1α, apoptosis and proliferation were observed, persisting for longer.The changes in the Sabra rats HSD were attributed to the pro-oxidant effects of the diet and those in the diabetic CDs to the HSD and maternal diabetes. In light of the DNA methylation changes in the liver of the CDs HSD, we presume that changes in gene expression are responsible for our findings, and that similar changes may lead to the metabolic syndrome at adulthood.© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29852391>Increased hepatic /CD36, PTP1B and decreased HNF4A expression contributes to dyslipidemia associated with ethanol-induced liver dysfunction: Rescue effect of ginger extract.</a></h1><p>The association between chronic alcohol consumption and the development of alcpholic liver disease is a very well known phenomenon, but the precise underlying molecular mediators involved in ethanol-induced liver disease remain elusive. This study aimed to characterize the  alterations and the molecular mediators which are related to  in liver under the heavy ethanol exposure alone or combined with ginger extract. Twenty-four male wistar rats were assigned into three groups, namely control, ethanol, and ginger extract treated ethanol (GETE) groups. Six weeks after the treatment, the ethanol group showed a significant increase in fatty acid translocase ()/CD36, protein  phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) and decrease hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 Alpha (HNF4A) genes expressions compared to the control group. The ethanol administration also significantly increased plasma LDL, cholesterol, triglyceride, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) compared to the control group. Moreover, compared to the control group, the ethanol group showed liver histhological changes, such as fibrosis, focal microvesicular steatosis, some apoptotic hepatocytes, spotty necrosis, portal lymphocytic inflammation, mallory-denk bodies, giant mitochondria, piecemeal necrosis. Consumption of ginger extract along with ethanol, partially ameliorated gene expression alteration and histological changes, improved undesirable  profile and liver enzymes changes compare to those in the ethanol group. These findings indicate that ethanol-induced liver abnormalities may in part be associated with  homeostasis changes mediated by overexpression of /CD36, PTP1B and downexpressionof HNF4A genes.

Herein, we aimed to demonstrate the inhibitory effects of UDCA-LPE on pro-fibrogenic integrin signalling. UDCA-LPE treatment of human embryonic liver cell line CL48 and primary human hepatic stellate cells induced a non-classical internalization of integrin β1 resulting in dephosphorylation and inhibition of SRC and focal adhesion kinase (FAK). Signalling analyses suggested that UDCA-LPE may act as a heterobivalent ligand for integrins and lysophospholipid receptor1 (LPAR1) and co-immunoprecipitation demonstrated the bridging effect of UDCA-LPE on integrin β1 and LPAR1. The disruption of either the UDCA-moiety binding to integrins by RGD-containing peptide GRGDSP or the LPE-moiety binding to LPAR1 by LPAR1 antagonist Ki16425 reversed inhibitory functions of UDCA-LPE. The lack of inhibitory functions of UDCA-PE and UDCA-LPE derivatives (14:0 and 12:0, LPE-moiety containing shorter fatty acid chain) as well as the consistency of the translocation of UDCA-LPE and integrins, which co-fractionated with LPE but not UDCA, suggested that the observed UDCA-LPE-induced translocation of integrins was mediated by LPE endocytic transport pathway.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31668688>Metabolomics of Aerobic Exercise in Chronic Stroke Survivors: A Pilot Study.</a></h1><p>Understanding the metabolic response to exercise may aid in optimizing stroke management.

Linear models for microarray data expression analysis was performed to determine metabolic changes over time, and Mummichog was used for pathway enrichment analysis following analysis of plasma samples by high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry.VOpeak change was greater following exercise than stretching (18.9% versus -.2%; P < .01). Pathway enrichment analysis of differentially expressed metabolites results showed significant enrichment in 4 pathways following treadmill exercise, 3 of which (heparan-, chondroitin-, keratan-sulfate degradation) involved connective tissue  and the fourth involve  signaling (linoleate ). More pathways were altered in pre and post comparisons of stretching, including branched-chain amino acid, tryptophan, , and urea cycle, which could indicate loss of lean body mass.These preliminary data show different metabolic changes due to treadmill training and stretching in chronic stroke survivors and suggest that in addition to improved aerobic capacity, weight-bearing activity, like walking, could protect against loss of lean body mass.

The effects of CAA treatment on the differentiation of 3T3‑L1 adipocytes were determined using Oil Red O. The expression levels of insulin signaling factors were detected via reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analyses. The results revealed that the overexpression of PTP1B contributed to insulin resistance, which was reversed by CAA treatment via inhibiting the activity of PTP1B and by regulating the expression of associated insulin signaling factors. The treatment of cell lines with Dex led to increased expression of PTP1B but decreased glucose consumption, and decreased  phosphorylation of insulin receptor, insulin receptor substrate 1, and phosphoinositide 3‑kinase. Treatment with CAA not only reduced the fasting blood glucose levels and protected organs from damage, but also reduced the serum fasting levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides and low‑density lipoprotein cholesterol in the T2DM rats. CAA treatment also inhibited adipocyte differentiation and decreased the mRNA levels of various adipogenic genes. Furthermore, CAA treatment restored the transduction of insulin signaling by regulating the expression of PTP1B and associated insulin signaling factors. Treatment with CAA also reduced the problems associated with hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia. In conclusion, CAA may be used to cure T2DM via restoring insulin resistance and preventing obesity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29848294>Aggregation of  rafts activates c-met and c-Src in non-small cell lung cancer cells.</a></h1><p>Activation of c-Met, a receptor  kinase, induces radiation therapy resistance in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The activated residual of c-Met is located in  rafts (Duhon et al. Mol Carcinog 49:739-49, 2010). Therefore, we hypothesized that disturbing the integrity of  rafts would restrain the activation of the c-Met protein and reverse radiation resistance in NSCLC. In this study, a series of experiments was performed to test this hypothesis.NSCLC A549 and H1993 cells were incubated with methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD), a  raft inhibitor, at different concentrations for 1 h before the cells were X-ray irradiated. The following methods were used: clonogenic (colony-forming) survival assays, flow cytometry (for cell cycle and apoptosis analyses), immunofluorescence microscopy (to show the distribution of proteins in  rafts), Western blotting, and biochemical  raft isolation (purifying  rafts to show the distribution of proteins in  rafts).Our results showed that X-ray irradiation induced the aggregation of  rafts in A549 cells, activated c-Met and c-Src, and induced c-Met and c-Src clustering to  rafts. More importantly, MβCD suppressed the proliferation of A549 and H1993 cells, and the combination of MβCD and radiation resulted in additive increases in A549 and H1993 cell apoptosis. Destroying the integrity of  rafts inhibited the aggregation of c-Met and c-Src to  rafts and reduced the expression of phosphorylated c-Met and phosphorylated c-Src in  rafts.X-ray irradiation induced the aggregation of  rafts and the clustering of c-Met and c-Src to  rafts through both  raft-dependent and  raft-independent mechanisms. The  raft-dependent activation of c-Met and its downstream pathways played an important role in the development of radiation resistance in NSCLC cells mediated by c-Met. Further studies are still required to explore the molecular mechanisms of the activation of c-Met and c-Src in  rafts induced by radiation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30525586>Celastrol Promotes Weight Loss in Diet-Induced Obesity by Inhibiting the Protein  Phosphatases PTP1B and TCPTP in the Hypothalamus.</a></h1><p>Celastrol is a natural pentacyclic triterpene used in traditional Chinese medicine with significant weight-lowering effects. Celastrol-administered mice at 100 μg/kg decrease food consumption and body weight via a leptin-dependent mechanism, yet its molecular targets in this pathway remain elusive. Here, we demonstrate in vivo that celastrol-induced weight loss is largely mediated by the inhibition of leptin negative regulators protein  phosphatase (PTP) 1B (PTP1B) and T-cell PTP (TCPTP) in the arcuate nucleus (ARC) of the hypothalamus. We show in vitro that celastrol binds reversibly and inhibits noncompetitively PTP1B and TCPTP. NMR data map the binding site to an allosteric site in the catalytic domain that is in proximity of the active site. By using a panel of PTPs implicated in hypothalamic leptin signaling, we show that celastrol additionally inhibited PTEN and SHP2 but had no activity toward other phosphatases of the PTP family. These results suggest that PTP1B and TCPTP in the ARC are essential for celastrol's weight lowering effects in adult obese mice.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31678514>Wnt5a/Ror2 pathway contributes to the regulation of cholesterol homeostasis and inflammatory response in atherosclerosis.</a></h1><p>Atherosclerosis (AS) is characterized by lipids  disorder and inflammatory response. Accumulating evidence has demonstrated that Wingless type 5a (Wnt5a) is implicated in cardiovascular diseases through non-canonical Wnt cascades. However, its precise role during the pathogenesis of AS is still unclear. Therefore, the present study aims to investigate the role and the underlying mechanism of Wnt5a/receptor  kinase-like orphan receptor 2 (Ror2) pathways in the promotion of AS process through affecting  accumulation and inflammation. In atherosclerotic clinical samples, Wnt5a levels were measured by using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) assay. In vivo experiments were conducted by using apolipoprotein E knockout (apoE) mice model. Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) were applied for in vitro studies. Wnt5a was highly expressed in both of atherosclerotic clinical samples and apoE mice. The knockdown of Wnt5a significantly inhibited cholesterol accumulation and inflammatory response. Additionally, the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammation aggravated the cholesterol accumulation and decreased adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) expression in VSMCs. Depletion of intracellular cholesterol by β-cyclodextrin (β-CD) led to the upregulation of ABCA1 and the inhibition of inflammation. Conversely, the overexpression of Wnt5a inhibited ABCA1 expression, facilitated cholesterol accumulation, impared cholesterol efflux, promoted NF-κB nuclear translocation and the inflammatory cytokines secretion. Moreover, the knockdown of Ror2 increased ABCA1 expression and reduced Wnt5a-induced cholesterol accumulation and inflammatory responses. Furthermore, the knockdown of ABCA1 enhanced cholesterol accumulation and inflammatory response. Therefore, Wnt5a/Ror2 pathway was critical in regulating cholesterol homeostasis and inflammatory response, which might be a promising therapeutic target for AS therapy.Copyright © 2019.

The presence of multiple potential protein- phosphatase (PTP) 1B substrates in PAF receptor signaling pathways brought us to investigate its involvement in PAF-induced cytokine expression in monocyte-derived dendritic cells (Mo-DCs) and to study the pathways involved in this modulation.We used in-vitro-matured human dendritic cells and the HEK-293 cell line in our studies. PTP1B inhibition was though siRNAs and a selective inhibitor. Cytokine expression was studied with RT-PCR, luciferase assays and ELISA. Phosphorylation status of kinases and transcription factors was studied with western blotting.Here, we report that PTP1B was involved in the modulation of cytokine expression in PAF-stimulated Mo-DCs. A study of the down-regulation of PAF-induced IL-8 expression, by PTP1B, showed modulation of PAF-induced transactivation of the IL-8 promoter which was dependent on the presence of the C/EBPß -binding site. Results also suggested that PTP1B decreased PAF-induced IL-8 production by a glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3-dependent pathway via activation of the Src family kinases (SFK). These kinases activated an unidentified pathway at early stimulation times and the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in a later phase. This change in GSK-3 activity decreased the C/EBPß phosphorylation levels of the threonine 235, a residue whose phosphorylation is known to increase C/EBPß transactivation potential, and consequently modified IL-8 expression.The negative regulation of GSK-3 activity by PTP1B and the consequent decrease in phosphorylation of the C/EBPß transactivation domain could be an important negative feedback loop by which cells control their cytokine production after PAF stimulation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30571460>Macrophage Inflammation, Erythrophagocytosis, and Accelerated Atherosclerosis in Jak2  Mice.</a></h1><p>The mechanisms driving atherothrombotic risk in individuals with JAK2  ( Jak2 ) positive clonal hematopoiesis or myeloproliferative neoplasms are poorly understood.The goal of this study was to assess atherosclerosis and underlying mechanisms in hypercholesterolemic mice with hematopoietic Jak2  expression.Irradiated low-density lipoprotein receptor knockout ( Ldlr) mice were transplanted with bone marrow from wild-type or Jak2  mice and fed a high- high-cholesterol Western diet. Hematopoietic functions and atherosclerosis were characterized. After 7 weeks of Western diet, Jak2  mice showed increased atherosclerosis. Early atherosclerotic lesions showed increased neutrophil adhesion and content, correlating with lesion size. After 12 weeks of Western diet, Jak2  lesions showed increased complexity, with larger necrotic cores, defective efferocytosis, prominent iron deposition, and costaining of erythrocytes and macrophages, suggesting erythrophagocytosis. Jak2  erythrocytes were more susceptible to phagocytosis by wild-type macrophages and showed decreased surface expression of CD47, a "don't-eat-me" signal. Human JAK2VF erythrocytes were also more susceptible to erythrophagocytosis. Jak2  macrophages displayed increased expression and production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, prominent inflammasome activation, increased p38 MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) signaling, and reduced levels of MerTK (c-Mer  kinase), a key molecule mediating efferocytosis. Increased erythrophagocytosis also suppressed efferocytosis.Hematopoietic Jak2  expression promotes early lesion formation and increased complexity in advanced atherosclerosis. In addition to increasing hematopoiesis and neutrophil infiltration in early lesions, Jak2  caused cellular defects in erythrocytes and macrophages, leading to increased erythrophagocytosis but defective efferocytosis. These changes promote accumulation of iron in plaques and increased necrotic core formation which, together with exacerbated proinflammatory responses, likely contribute to plaque instability.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30328028>Sitagliptin Protects Cardiac Function by Reducing Nitroxidative Stress and Promoting Autophagy in Zucker Diabetic Fatty (ZDF) Rats.</a></h1><p>The purpose of the study is to identify potential mechanisms involved in the cardiac protective effects of sitagliptin in Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rats.Male non-diabetic lean Zucker rats (Lean) and ZDF rats treated with saline (ZDF) or sitagliptin (ZDF + sita) were used in this study. The blood pressure and  profiles were increased significantly in ZDF rats compared with Lean rats. ZDF + sitagliptin rats had decreased systolic blood pressure compared with ZDF rats. Sitagliptin treatment decreased total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TGs), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels. Ejection fraction (EF) and fractional shortening (FS) were decreased in ZDF rats, which improved with sitagliptin from 59.8% ± 3.0 and 34.5% ± 3.1 to 66.9% ± 3.4 and 40.9% ± 4.2, respectively. Moreover, the nitroxidative stress level was increased while autophagy levels were decreased in ZDF rats, which was reversed by the administration of sitagliptin. Treatment with sitagliptin or FeTMPyP improved the autophagy level in high-glucose cultured H9c2 cells by increasing autolysosome numbers from 15 ± 4 to 21 ± 3 and 22 ± 3, respectively. We detected a positive correlation between DPP-4 activity and 3-nitrotyrosine levels (r = 0.3903; P < 0.01), a negative correlation between Beclin-1 levels and DPP-4 activity (r = - 0.3335; P < 0.01), and a negative correlation between 3-nitrotyrosine and Beclin-1 levels (r = - 0.3794; P < 0.01) in coronary heart disease patients.Sitagliptin alleviates diabetes-induced cardiac injury by reducing nitroxidative stress and promoting autophagy.

This functional diversity has made understanding how inositol polyphosphates regulate cellular processes challenging to dissect. However, some inositol phosphates have been unexpectedly found in X-ray crystal structures, occasionally revealing structural and mechanistic details of effector protein regulation before functional consequences have been described. This review highlights a sampling of crystal structures describing the interaction between inositol phosphates and protein effectors. This list includes the RNA editing enzyme "adenosine deaminase that acts on RNA 2" (ADAR2), the Pds5B regulator of cohesin dynamics, the class 1 histone deacetylases (HDACs) HDAC1 and HDAC3, and the PH domain of Bruton's  kinase (Btk). One of the most important enzymes responsible for higher-order inositol phosphate synthesis is inositol polyphosphate multikinase (IPMK), which plays dual roles in both inositol and phosphoinositide signaling. Structures of phosphoinositide  binding proteins have also revealed new aspects of protein effector regulation, as mediated by the nuclear receptors Steroidogenic Factor-1 (SF-1, NR5A2) and Liver Receptor Homolog-1 (LRH-1, NR5A2). Together, these studies underscore the structural diversity in binding interactions between effector proteins and inositol phosphate small signaling molecules, and further support that detailed structural studies can lead to new biological discovery.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

This review aims to summarize the current knowledge regarding the clinical management of ACC.Surgery remains the cornerstone for localized ACC management. In more advanced cases, debulking surgery when feasible can help with hormonal control and may allow the initiation of systemic therapy. Over the last few years, our understanding of ACC molecular pathogenesis has expanded with no significant change in treatment options. Platinum-based chemotherapy is the gold standard in metastatic ACC despite suboptimal efficacy.  kinase inhibitor use did not result in meaningful benefit in ACC patients. Multiple clinical trials are currently exploring the role of immunotherapy in ACC. Despite the remarkable improvement in our understanding of the molecular signature and pathways in ACC, this knowledge did not yield a major breakthrough in management of advanced ACC.

Although the major components of bacterial cell walls have been known for decades, the complex regulatory network controlling peptidoglycan synthesis and many details of the cell division machinery are not well understood. The eukaryotic-like serine/threonine kinase Stk and the cognate phosphatase Stp play an important role in cell wall biosynthesis and drug resistance in S. aureus. We show that stp deletion has a pronounced impact on cell wall synthesis. Deletion of stp leads to a thicker cell wall and decreases susceptibility to lysostaphin. Stationary phase Δstp cells accumulate peptidoglycan precursors and incorporate higher amounts of incomplete muropeptides with non-glycine, monoglycine and monoalanine interpeptide bridges into the cell wall. In line with this cell wall phenotype, we demonstrate that the  II:glycine glycyltransferase FemX can be phosphorylated by the Ser/Thr kinase Stk in vitro. Mass spectrometric analyses identify Thr32, Thr36 and Ser415 as phosphoacceptors. The cognate phosphatase Stp dephosphorylates these phosphorylation sites. Moreover, Stk interacts with FemA and FemB, but is unable to phosphorylate them. Our data indicate that Stk and Stp modulate cell wall synthesis and cell division at several levels.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31271659>Changes in whole metabolites after exenatide treatment in overweight/obese polycystic ovary syndrome patients.</a></h1><p>Exenatide is a new agent for diabetes therapy, and its use in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) has gradually increased; however, the clinical benefit and metabolic improvement need further evidence. This research aimed to study the changes in whole metabolites before and after exenatide treatment in overweight/obese PCOS patients to gain a better understanding of exenatide for the treatment of PCOS.Sixty-seven women, including 32 with PCOS and 35 age-matched controls, were recruited. The metabolite changes were detected with nontargeted gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (NTGC-MS) before and after exenatide treatment, and changes in clinical biochemical characteristics were also observed.A total of 62 metabolites were differentially expressed between the healthy and PCOS groups, and 31 differentially expressed metabolites were detected before and after exenatide treatment. Abnormal  and amino acid  were the main metabolic disorders. Exenatide improved  and amino acid , especially amino acid metabolites. Three types of branched-chain amino acids (valine, leucine and isoleucine), two types of aromatic amino acids (phenylalanine and ) and lysine are important potential metabolites for the therapeutic efficacy of exenatide. Many abnormal metabolic disorders are related to insulin resistance, oxidative stress and even ovulatory dysfunction. Moreover, in this small sample clinical study, we also found that exenatide improved insulin sensitivity, reduced body weight and improved glycolipid  in PCOS.NTGC-MS-based metabolic pathway analysis revealed that exenatide has a beneficial effect on overweight/obese PCOS patients by regulating metabolic disorders, especially amino acid disorders.© 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30047085>A rule governing the FtsH-mediated proteolysis of the MgtC virulence protein from Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium.</a></h1><p>A tightly controlled turnover of membrane proteins is required for  bilayer stability, cell , and cell viability. Among the energy-dependent AAA proteases in Salmonella, FtsH is the only membrane-bound protease that contributes to the quality control of membrane proteins. FtsH preferentially degrades the C-terminus or N-terminus of misfolded, misassembled, or damaged proteins to maintain physiological functions. We found that FtsH hydrolyzes the Salmonella MgtC virulence protein when we substitute the MgtC 226 Trp, which is well conserved in other intracellular pathogens and normally protects MgtC from the FtsH-mediated proteolysis. Here we investigate a rule determining the FtsH-mediated proteolysis of the MgtC protein at Trp226 residue. Substitution of MgtC tryptophan 226 residue to alanine, glycine, or  leads to MgtC proteolysis in a manner dependent on the FtsH protease whereas substitution to phenylalanine, methionine, isoleucine, leucine, or valine resists MgtC degradation by FtsH. These data indicate that a large and hydrophobic side chain at 226 residue is required for protection from the FtsH-mediated MgtC proteolysis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30312772>Interaction of γ-conglutin from Lupinus albus with model phospholipid membranes: Investigations on structure, thermal stability and oligomerization status.</a></h1><p>Interaction with model phospholipid membranes of lupin seed γ-conglutin, a glycaemia-lowering protein from Lupinus albus seeds, has been studied by means of Fourier-Transform infrared spectroscopy at pH 7.0 and at pH 4.5. The protein maintains the same secondary structure both at pH 7.0 and at pH 4.5, but at pH 7.0 a higher H/H exchange was observed, indicating a greater solvent accessibility. The difference in T and T of the protein at the abovementioned pH's has been calculated around 20 °C. Infrared measurements have been then performed in the presence of DMPG and DOPA at pH 4.5. DMPG showed a little destabilizing effect while DOPA exerted a great stabilizing effect, increasing the T of γ-conglutin at pH 4.5 of more than 20 °C. Since γ-conglutin at pH 4.5 is in the monomeric form, the interaction with DOPA likely promotes the oligomerization even at pH 4.5. Interaction between DMPG or DOPA and γ-conglutin has been confirmed by turbidity experiments with DMPC:DMPG or DOPC:DOPA SUVs. Turbidity data also showed high-affinity binding of γ-conglutin to anionic SUVs made up with DOPA. The molecular features outlined in this study are relevant to address the applicative exploitation and to delineate a deeper comprehension of the natural functional role of γ-conglutin.Copyright © 2018 The Author(s).

Identification of metabolic-based biomarkers could allow the development of a reliable and sensitive classification technique and even therapeutic management. Our pilot study investigated whether metabolites in plasma are characteristic of Sasang constitutions. Ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry-based metabolic analysis was conducted against 15 Soyangin (SY), 15 Taeeumin (TE), and 18 Soeumin (SE) individuals, as classified according to the Questionnaire for Sasang Constitution Classification II (QSCC II) and specialist diagnosis. Metabolomics data showed that the TE group was significantly separated from the SY and SE groups. Nine canonical pathways related to constitution; phenylalanine , aminoacyl-tRNA, , and tryptophan biosynthesis were activated in the TE group as compared with the other groups. Similar to the results of the metabolomics analysis, the TE group was also significantly separated from the other two groups by lipidomic analysis. On the other hand, the intensity of  metabolites was higher in the SY group than in the other groups. Our findings suggest that the combined analysis of metabolomics and lipidomics can provide useful information for characteristics of Sasang constitutions.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30101577>The achievement of boar sperm in vitro capacitation is related to an increase of disrupted disulphide bonds and intracellular reactive oxygen species levels.</a></h1><p>The aim of this work was to determine the relationship of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the disulphide bonds established between sperm proteins with the achievement of capacitation in boar spermatozoa. With this purpose, spermatozoa were incubated in a specifically designed in vitro capacitation medium (CM) in the presence or absence of reduced glutathione (GSH). Incubation of boar spermatozoa in CM for 4 h significantly (p < 0.05) increased free cysteine residues, which is a marker of disrupted disulphide bonds, and also intracellular ROS levels. The addition of GSH to the medium prevented most capacitation-like changes in sperm motility, membrane  disorder, mitochondrial membrane potential, intracellular calcium levels and localization of -phosphorylated proteins (pTyr), but not in  phosphorylation of P32. These effects were accompanied by the inhibition of the ability of sperm cells to trigger the acrosome exocytosis in response to progesterone. When GSH was added together with progesterone after 4 h of incubation, acrosome exocytosis was not altered, but the subsequent decrease in intracellular calcium observed in controls cells was inhibited. Furthermore, co-incubation of oocytes with spermatozoa previously incubated in CM in the presence of GSH for 4 h significantly (p < 0.05) increased the number of spermatozoa attached to the oocyte surface but decreased normal fertilization rates. Our results suggest that boar sperm capacitation is related to an increase in disrupted disulphide bonds and intracellular ROS levels and that both events are related to the regulation of hyperactivated motility, intracellular calcium dynamics, sperm binding ability to the oocyte and achievement of proper nuclear decondensation upon oocyte penetration.© 2018 American Society of Andrology and European Academy of Andrology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30668822>Algal Protein Kinase, Triacylglycerol Accumulation Regulator 1, Modulates Cell Viability and Gametogenesis in Carbon/Nitrogen-Imbalanced Conditions.</a></h1><p>Nutrient-deprived microalgae accumulate triacylglycerol (TAG) in  droplets. A dual-specificity  phosphorylation-regulated kinase, TAG accumulation regulator 1 (TAR1) has been shown to be required for acetate-dependent TAG accumulation and the degradation of chlorophyll and photosynthesis-related proteins in photomixotrophic nitrogen (N)-deficient conditions (Kajikawa etï¿½al. 2015). However, this previous report only examined particular condition. Here, we report that in photoautotrophic N-deficient conditions, tar1-1 cells, with a mutation in the TAR1 gene, maintained higher levels of cell viability and lower levels of hydrogen peroxide generation and accumulated higher levels of TAG and starch compared with those of wild type (WT) cells with bubbling of air containing 5% carbon dioxide. Transcriptomic analyses suggested that genes involved in the scavenging of reactive oxygen species are not repressed in tar1-1 cells. In contrast, the mating efficiency and mRNA levels of key regulatory genes for gametogenesis, MID, MTD and FUS, were suppressed in tar1-1 cells. Among the TAR1-dependent phosphopeptides deduced by phosphoproteomic analysis, protein kinases and enzymes related to N assimilation and carbon (C)  are of particular interest. Characterization of these putative downstream factors may elucidate the molecular pathway whereby TAR1 mediates cellular propagation and C and N  in C/N-imbalanced stress conditions.ï¿½ The Author(s) 2019.

Model systems and human genetics support a role for IDOL in regulating circulating LDL levels. Whether IDOL plays a broader metabolic role and affects development of metabolic syndrome-associated comorbidities is unknown. Approach and Results- We studied WT (wild type) and Idol (Idol-KO) mice in 2 models: physiological aging and diet-induced obesity. In both models, deletion of Idol protected mice from metabolic dysfunction. On a Western-type diet, Idol loss resulted in decreased circulating levels of cholesterol, triglycerides, glucose, and insulin. This was accompanied by protection from weight gain in short- and long-term dietary challenges, which could be attributed to reduced hepatosteatosis and  mass in Idol-KO mice. Although feeding and intestinal  uptake were unchanged in Idol-KO mice, their brown adipose tissue was protected from  accumulation and had elevated expression of UCP1 (uncoupling protein 1) and TH ( hydroxylase). Indirect calorimetry indicated a marked increase in locomotion and suggested a trend toward increased cumulative energy expenditure and  oxidation. An increase in in vivo clearance of reconstituted lipoprotein particles in Idol-KO mice may sustain this energetic demand. In the BXD mouse genetic reference population, hepatic Idol expression correlates with multiple metabolic parameters, thus providing support for findings in the Idol-KO mice. Conclusions- Our study uncovers an unrecognized role for Idol in regulation of whole body  in physiological aging and on a Western-type diet. These findings support Idol inhibition as a therapeutic strategy to target multiple metabolic syndrome-associated comorbidities.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30583420>Comparative study on the nutrients, heavy metals and pesticide composition of some locally produced and marketed rice varieties in Nigeria.</a></h1><p>The nutrients, heavy metals and pesticide concentrations of an imported (Gold) and three locally produced and marketed rice varieties (Samples B-mass, C-R8 and D-CP) in Nigeria were investigated using standard techniques.

However, PUFA purities, caloric content, and ratios in different diets may affect the results. By using -1 mice which convert n-6 to n-3 PUFAs in the brain, this study further evaluated anti-depressant mechanisms of n-3 PUFAs in a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced model. Adult male -1 and wild-type (WT) mice were fed soybean oil diet for 8 weeks. Depression-like behaviors were measured 24 h after saline or LPS central administration. In WT littermates, LPS reduced sucrose intake, but increased immobility in forced-swimming and tail suspension tests. Microglial M1 phenotype CD11b expression and concentrations of interleukin (IL)-1β, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and IL-17 were elevated, while M2 phenotype-related IL-4, IL-10, and transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1 were decreased. LPS also reduced the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and  receptor kinase B (Trk B), while increasing glial fibrillary acidic protein expression and pro-BDNF, p75, NO, and iNOS levels. In -1 mice, LPS-induced behavioral changes were attenuated, which were associated with decreased pro-inflammatory cytokines and reversed changes in p75, NO, iNOS, and BDNF. Gas chromatography assay confirmed increased n-3 PUFA levels and n-3/n-6 ratios in the brains of -1 mice. In conclusion, endogenous n-3 PUFAs may improve LPS-induced depression-like behavior through balancing M1 and M2-phenotypes and normalizing BDNF function.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30033504>Genetic Deletion of Soluble Epoxide Hydroxylase Causes Anxiety-Like Behaviors in Mice.</a></h1><p>Soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH), an enzyme with COOH-terminal hydrolase and NH-terminal  phosphatase activities, is expressed in regions of the brain such as the cortex, white matter, hippocampus, substantia nigra, and striatum. sEH is involved in the regulation of cerebrovascular and neuronal function upon pathological insults. However, the physiological significance of sEH and its underlying mechanism in modulating brain function are not fully understood. In this study, we investigated the role of sEH in anxiety and potential underlying mechanisms in mice. Western blot for protein phosphorylation and expression was performed. Immunohistochemical analyses and Nissl and Golgi staining were performed for histological examination. Mouse behaviors were evaluated by open field activity, elevated plus maze, classical fear conditioning, social preference test, and Morris water maze. Our results demonstrated that the expression of sEH was upregulated during postnatal development in wild-type (WT) mice. Genetic deletion of sEH (sEH) in mice resulted in anxiety-like behavior and disrupted social preference. Increased olfactory bulb (OB) size and altered integrity of neurites were observed in sEH mice. In addition, ablation of sEH in mice decreased protein expression of  hydroxylase and reduced dopamine production in the brain. Moreover, the level of phosphorylated calmodulin kinase II (CaMKII) and glycogen synthase kinase 3 α/β (GSK3α/β) was higher in sEH mice than in WT mice. Collectively, these findings suggest that sEH is a key player in neurite outgrowth of neurons, OB development in the brain, and the development of anxiety-like behavior, by regulating the CaMKII-GSK3α/β signaling pathway.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31228712>Hepatopancreas and ovarian transcriptome response to different dietary soybean lecithin levels in Portunus trituberculatus.</a></h1><p>Ovaries (O) are specialized tissues that play critical roles in producing oocytes and hormones. The crustacean hepatopancreas (H) is a metabolic organ that plays important functions including absorption, storage of nutrients and vitellogenesis during growth and ovarian development. However, genetic information on the biological functions of the crustacean ovaries and hepatopancreas are limited. This study compared the transcriptome in the ovary and the hepatopancreas of female P. trituberculatus fed two different diets containing 0% (SL0) and 4% soybean lecithin (SL4), respectively during the growth and ovarian maturation stages by Illumina HiSeq4000 sequencer. The differences between ovary and hepatopancreas of P. trituberculatus were also compared at transcriptional level. A total of 55,667 unigenes were obtained with mean length of 962 bps across the four treatment groups (SL0_O, SL4_O, SL0_H and SL4_H). In ovary, there were 257 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between SL0_O and SL4_O, with 145 down- and 112 up-regulated genes in the SL4_O group. Candidate genes involved in ovarian development were detected in SL4_H group. In hepatopancreas, 146 DEGs were found between SL0_H and SL4_H, including 43 down- and 103 up-regulated genes in the SL4_H group. The specific DEGs were mainly involved with  related  pathways, including  digestion and absorption, PPAR signaling pathway and insulin resistance. 14,725 DEGs were found in the comparison between SL0_O and SL4_H, including 7250 up- and 7475 down-regulated genes in the SL4_H group. The specific DEGs were mainly involved with  ( digestion and absorption, linoleic acid ), hormone (steroid hormone biosynthesis, ovarian steroidogenesis, etc), and amino acid (phenylalanine , arginine biosynthesis, ) related  pathways. Crabs fed the SL4 diet exhibited higher gene expression of cryptocyanin 1 (cc1), cryptocyanin 2 (cc2) and neuroparsin 1 (np1) in hepatopancreas and ovarian than those fed the SL0 diet, however, crab fed SL4 diet showed higher gene expression of fatty acid-binding protein 1 (fabp1), vitellogenin (vtg) and Delta-6 desaturase-like protein (fadsd6) in hepatopancreas than those fed the SL0 diet. Moreover, crabs fed the SL0 diet had lower gene expression of vtg, extracellular copper‑zinc superoxide dismutase (cuznsod) and estrogen sulfotransferase (ests) in ovary compared to those fed the diet containing 4% soybean lecithin. These results might provide important clues with respect to elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of phospholipid on the gonadal development and  of P. trituberculatus.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

We evaluated the oral toxicity of isopsoralen in Wistar rats treated for 3 months at doses of 0, 3.5, 7.0, and 14 mg/kg. Additionally, the plasma metabolomics of isopsoralen in male and female rats treated for 3 months at doses of 0 and 14 mg/kg were investigated by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Many abnormalities were observed in the isopsoralen-treated rats, including suppression of body weight gain, and changes in serum biochemical parameters and visceral coefficients. Histopathological changes in liver, pancreatic, and reproductive system tissues were also observed in the isopsoralen-treated rats. The metabolomic analyses showed alterations in many metabolites (19 in female rats; 28 in male rats) after isopsoralen administration. The significant changes in these metabolites revealed metabolomic alterations in the isopsoralen-treated rats, especially in amino acid  regardless of sex, including phenylalanine, , and tryptophan biosynthesis and glycine, serine, and threonine . Furthermore, fatty acid  comprised the main affected pathways in female rats, while  and energy  were the main affected pathways in male rats.Copyright © 2019.

Metabolic adaptations in malignant PC cells play a key role in fueling the growth and progression of the disease. Unfortunately, little is known regarding these changes in cellular . Here, we demonstrate that centromere protein F (CENPF), a protein associated with the centromere-kinetochore complex and chromosomal segregation during mitosis, is mechanically linked to altered  and progression in PC. Using the CRISPR-Cas9 system, we silenced the gene for CENPF in human PC3 cells. These cells were found to have reduced levels of epithelial-mesenchymal transition markers and inhibited cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Silencing of CENPF also simultaneously improved sensitivity to anoikis-induced apoptosis. Mass spectrometry analysis of  phosphorylated proteins from CENPF knockout (CENPF) and control cells revealed that CENPF silencing increased inactive forms of pyruvate kinase M2, a rate limiting enzyme needed for an irreversible reaction in glycolysis. Furthermore, CENPF cells had reduced global bio-energetic capacity, acetyl-CoA production, histone acetylation, and , suggesting that CENPF is a critical regulator of cancer , potentially through its effects on mitochondrial functioning. Additional quantitative immunohistochemistry and imaging analyzes on a series of PC tumor microarrays demonstrated that CENPF expression is significantly increased in higher-risk PC patients. Based on these findings, we suggest the CENPF may be an important regulator of PC  through its role in the mitochondria.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30597865>Satiating Effect of High Protein Diets on Resistance-Trained Subjects in Energy Deficit.</a></h1><p>Short-term energy deficit strategies are practiced by weight class and physique athletes, often involving high protein intakes to maximize satiety and maintain lean mass despite a paucity of research. This study compared the satiating effect of two protein diets on resistance-trained individuals during short-term energy deficit. Following ethical approval, 16 participants (age: 28 ± 2 years; height: 1.72 ± 0.03 m; body-mass: 88.83 ± 5.54 kg; body-: 21.85 ± 1.82%) were randomly assigned to 7-days moderate (PRO: 1.8 g·kg·d) or high protein (PRO: 2.9 g·kg·d) matched calorie-deficit diets in a cross-over design. Daily satiety responses were recorded throughout interventions. Pre-post diet, plasma ghrelin and peptide   (PYY), and satiety ratings were assessed in response to a protein-rich meal. Only perceived satisfaction was significantly greater following PRO (67.29 ± 4.28 v 58.96 ± 4.51 mm,  = 0.04). Perceived cravings increased following PRO only (46.25 ± 4.96 to 57.60 ± 4.41 mm,  = 0.01). Absolute ghrelin concentration significantly reduced post-meal following PRO (972.8 ± 130.4 to 613.6 ± 114.3 pg·mL;  = 0.003), remaining lower than PRO at 2 h (-0.40 ± 0.06 v -0.26 ± 0.06 pg·mL normalized relative change;  = 0.015). Absolute PYY concentration increased to a similar extent post-meal (PRO: 84.9 ± 8.9 to 147.1 ± 11.9 pg·mL, PRO: 100.6 ± 9.5 to 143.3 ± 12.0 pg·mL;  < 0.001), but expressed as relative change difference was significantly greater for PRO at 2 h (+0.39 ± 0.20 pg·mL v -0.28 ± 0.12 pg·mL;  = 0.001). Perceived hunger, fullness and satisfaction post-meal were comparable between diets ( > 0.05). However, desire to eat remained significantly blunted for PRO ( = 0.048). PRO does not confer additional satiating benefits in resistance-trained individuals during short-term energy deficit. Ghrelin and PYY responses to a test-meal support the contention that satiety was maintained following PRO, although athletes experiencing negative symptoms (i.e., cravings) may benefit from protein-rich meals as opposed to over-consumption of protein.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30157875>Chemotherapy induced PRL3 expression promotes cancer growth via plasma membrane remodeling and specific alterations of caveolae-associated signaling.</a></h1><p>The outcome of cancer therapy is greatly defined by the ability of a tumor cell to evade treatment and re-establish its bulk mass after medical interventions. Consequently, there is an urgent need for the characterization of molecules affecting tumor reoccurrence. The phosphatase of regenerating liver 3 (PRL3) protein was recently emerged among the targets that could affect such a phenomenon.The expression induction of PRL3 in melanoma cells treated with chemotherapeutic agents was assessed by western blotting. The effect of PRL3 expression on cancer growth was investigated both in vitro and in vivo. The association of PRL3 with the caveolae structures of the plasma membrane was analyzed by detergent free raft purification. The effect of PRL3 expression on the membrane organization was assayed by electron microscopy and by membrane biophysical measurements. Purification of the plasma membrane fraction and co-immunoprecipitation were used to evaluate the altered protein composition of the plasma membrane upon PRL3 expression.Here, we identified PRL3 as a genotoxic stress-induced oncogene whose expression is significantly increased by the presence of classical antitumor therapeutics. Furthermore, we successfully connected the presence of this oncogene with increased tumor growth, which implies that tumor cells can utilize PRL3 effects as a survival strategy. We further demonstrated the molecular mechanism that is connected with the pro-growth action of PRL3, which is closely associated with its localization to the caveolae-type  raft compartment of the plasma membrane. In our study, PRL3 was associated with distinct changes in the plasma membrane structure and in the caveolar proteome, such as the dephosphorylation of integrin β1 at Thr788/Thr789 and the increased partitioning of Rac1 to the plasma membrane. These alterations at the plasma membrane were further associated with the elevation of cyclin D1 in the nucleus.This study identifies PRL3 as an oncogene upregulated in cancer cells upon exposure to anticancer therapeutics. Furthermore, this work contributes to the existing knowledge on PRL3 function by characterizing its association with the caveolae-like domains of the plasma membrane and their resident proteins.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29931911>[Immediate-early c-fos and  hydroxylase protein expression in different brain regions in high- induced obesity in mice].</a></h1><p>To examine brain dopamine expression in chronic high- diet(HFD)-induced obese mice.Ten male mice were fed by a high- diet (HF:45% of calories from ) for 12 weeks and then classified as HFD group. Ten male mice were fed a low- diet (LF:10% of calories from ) and used as control group (NCD). In the 10 week, the blood of the caudal vein was collected to determine the basal blood glucose level after both groups mice were fast for 12 h. Intraperitoneal (IP) glucose tolerance test (GTT) and insulin tolerance (ITT) were performed in HFD and NCD mice in the 12 week. Animals were sacrificed after fasting for 4 hours at the 12 week. Brain tissues were processed for Fos-ir and TH-ir by immunohistochemistry.After 12 weeks of feeding, body weight was significant higher in HFD mice than that in NCD ones. During GTT and ITT, HFD mice had significantly decreased glucose tolerance and insulin tolerance at 15 min and 30 min respectively than NCD ones (<0.05).

IR binds insulin at the cell surface and transduces rapid signaling via cytoplasmic kinases. However, mechanisms mediating long-term effects of insulin remain unclear. Here, we show that IR associates with RNA polymerase II in the nucleus, with striking enrichment at promoters genome-wide. The target genes were highly enriched for insulin-related functions including  and protein synthesis and diseases including diabetes, neurodegeneration, and cancer. IR chromatin binding was increased by insulin and impaired in an insulin-resistant disease model. Promoter binding by IR was mediated by coregulator host cell factor-1 (HCF-1) and transcription factors, revealing an HCF-1-dependent pathway for gene regulation by insulin. These results show that IR interacts with transcriptional machinery at promoters and identify a pathway regulating genes linked to insulin's effects in physiology and disease.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Male F1 offspring were mated with normal females to generate F2 offspring. Behavioral tests were used to assess cognitive functions in F1 and F2 offspring. Reduced representation bisulfite sequencing was used to the explore mechanisms of epigenetic inheritance.HFD-induced paternal obesity resulted in cognitive impairments in F1 offspring, potentially due, at least in part, to increased methylation of the BDNF gene promoter, which was inherited from F0 spermatozoa. BDNF/ receptor kinase B signaling was associated with cognitive impairments in HFD-fed F1 offspring.

The goal of this study was to investigate whether there are sex differences in resistance training effects on metabolic alterations induced by monosodium glutamate (MSG), a model of obesity, in male and female rats. Male and female Wistar rats received MSG (4 g/kg body weight/day, s.c.) from postnatal day 1 to 10. After 10 days from MSG administration, the rats were separated into two groups: MSG-sedentary and MSG-exercised. At postnatal day 60, the animals started a resistance training protocol in an 80 degrees inclined vertical ladder apparatus and performed it for 7 weeks. Control rats received saline solution and were divided in saline-sedentary and saline-exercised. Resistance training restored all plasma biochemical parameters (glucose, cholesterol, triglycerides, aspartate aminotransferase, and alanine aminotransferase) increased in male and female rats treated with MSG. The MSG administration induced hyperglycemia associated with a decrease in the skeletal muscle glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) levels and accompanied by deregulation in proteins, G-6Pase, and  aminotransferase, involved in hepatic glucose  of male and female rats. MSG induced dyslipidemia and lipotoxicity in the liver and skeletal muscle of male rats. Regarding female rats, lipotoxicity was found only in the skeletal muscle. The resistance training had beneficial effects against metabolic alterations induced by MSG in male and female rats, through regulation of proteins (GLUT2, protein kinase B, and GLUT4) involved in glucose and  pathways in the liver and skeletal muscle.© 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31159256>Low-Dose Stevia (Rebaudioside A) Consumption Perturbs Gut Microbiota and the Mesolimbic Dopamine Reward System.</a></h1><p>Stevia is a natural low-calorie sweetener that is growing in popularity in food and beverage products. Despite its widespread use, little is understood of its impact on the gut microbiota, an important environmental factor that can mediate  and subsequent obesity and disease risk. Furthermore, given previous reports of dysbiosis with some artificial low-calorie sweeteners, we wanted to understand whether prebiotic consumption could rescue potential stevia-mediated changes in gut microbiota. Three-week old male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized to consume: (1) Water (CTR); (2) Rebaudioside A (STV); (3) prebiotic (PRE); (4) Rebaudioside A + prebiotic (SP) ( = 8/group) for 9 weeks. Rebaudioside was added to drinking water and prebiotic oligofructose-enriched inulin added to control diet (10%). Body weight and feces were collected weekly and food and fluid intake biweekly. Oral glucose and insulin tolerance tests, gut permeability tests, dual X-ray absorptiometry, and tissue harvest were performed at age 12 weeks. Rebaudioside A consumption alone did not alter weight gain or glucose tolerance compared to CTR. Rebaudioside A did, however, alter gut microbiota composition and reduce nucleus accumbens  hydroxylase and dopamine transporter mRNA levels compared to CTR. Prebiotic animals, alone or with Rebaudioside A, had reduced  mass, food intake, and gut permeability and cecal SCFA concentration. Adding Rebaudioside A did not interfere with the benefits of the prebiotic except for a significant reduction in cecal weight. Long-term low-dose Rebaudioside A consumption had little effect on glucose  and weight gain; however, its impact on gut microbial taxa should be further examined in populations exhibiting dysbiosis such as obesity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30454647>Obesity Drives STAT-1-Dependent NASH and STAT-3-Dependent HCC.</a></h1><p>Obesity is a major driver of cancer, especially hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The prevailing view is that non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and fibrosis or cirrhosis are required for HCC in obesity. Here, we report that NASH and fibrosis and HCC in obesity can be dissociated. We show that the oxidative hepatic environment in obesity inactivates the STAT-1 and STAT-3 phosphatase T cell protein  phosphatase (TCPTP) and increases STAT-1 and STAT-3 signaling. TCPTP deletion in hepatocytes promoted T cell recruitment and ensuing NASH and fibrosis as well as HCC in obese C57BL/6 mice that normally do not develop NASH and fibrosis or HCC. Attenuating the enhanced STAT-1 signaling prevented T cell recruitment and NASH and fibrosis but did not prevent HCC. By contrast, correcting STAT-3 signaling prevented HCC without affecting NASH and fibrosis. TCPTP-deletion in hepatocytes also markedly accelerated HCC in mice treated with a chemical carcinogen that promotes HCC without NASH and fibrosis. Our studies reveal how obesity-associated hepatic oxidative stress can independently contribute to the pathogenesis of NASH, fibrosis, and HCC.Copyright © 2018 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

This study explored the utility of  suspensions for enhancing oral bioavailability of the rather hydrophobic drug nilotinib in vivo in rats.Four  suspensions were developed containing long chain triglycerides, medium chain triglyceride, long chain monoglycerides and medium chain monoglycerides and in vivo bioavailability was compared to an aqueous suspension. Additionally, in vitro lipolysis and wettability tests were conducted.Nilotinib  suspensions did not show a bioavailability increase compared to an aqueous suspension. The bioavailability was lower for triglyceride suspensions, relative to both monoglyceride and an aqueous suspension. The long chain monoglyceride displayed a significantly higher bioavailability relative to triglycerides. In vitro lipolysis results suggested entrapment of nilotinib crystals within poorly dispersible triglycerides, leading to slower nilotinib release and absorption. This was further supported by higher wettability of nilotinib by lipids.Monoglycerides improved oral bioavailability of nilotinib in rats, relative to triglycerides. For 'brick dust' drugs formulated as  suspensions, poorly dispersible formulations may delay the release of drug crystals from the formulation leading to reduced absorption.

Oxidative stress and neuroinflammation both are shown to be involved in the etiopathogenesis of PD. The aim of this study was to evaluate the therapeutic potential of thymol, a dietary monoterpene phenol in rotenone (ROT)-induced neurodegeneration in rats that precisely mimics PD in humans. Male Wistar rats were injected ROT at a dose of 2.5 mg/kg body weight for 4 weeks, to induce PD. Thymol was co-administered for 4 weeks at a dose of 50 mg/kg body weight, 30 min prior to ROT injection. The markers of dopaminergic neurodegeneration, oxidative stress and inflammation were estimated using biochemical assays, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, western blotting and immunocytochemistry. ROT challenge increased the oxidative stress markers, inflammatory enzymes and cytokines as well as caused significant damage to nigrostriatal dopaminergic system of the brain. Thymol treatment in ROT challenged rats appears to significantly attenuate dopaminergic neuronal loss, oxidative stress and inflammation.

For successful insect vitellogenesis and oogenesis, vitellogenin (Vg) synthesized in the  body (homologue to vertebrate liver and adipose tissue) must pass through the intercellular channels, a condition known as patency in the follicular epithelium, to reach the surface of oocytes. This process is controlled by juvenile hormone (JH) in many insect species, but the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Previous work has suggested the possible involvement of Na/K-ATPase in patency initiation, but again, the regulatory cascade of Na/K-ATPase for patency initiation has been lacking. Using the migratory locust  as a model system, we report here that RNAi-mediated knockdown of gene coding for Na/K-ATPase, inhibition of its phosphorylation, or suppression of its activity causes loss of patency, resulting in blocked Vg uptake, arrested oocyte maturation, and impaired ovarian growth. JH triggers G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), receptor  kinase (RTK), phospholipase C (PLC), inositol trisphosphate receptor (IP3R), and protein kinase C (PKC) to phosphorylate Na/K-ATPase α-subunit at amino acid residue Ser, consequently activating Na/K-ATPase for the induction of patency in vitellogenic follicular epithelium. Our results thus point to a previously unidentified mechanism by which JH induces the phosphorylation and activation of Na/K-ATPase via a signaling cascade of GPCR, RTK, PLC, IP3R, and PKC. The findings advance our understanding of JH regulation in insect vitellogenesis and oogenesis.© 2018 Jing et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30692269>IMP2 Increases Mouse Skeletal Muscle Mass and Voluntary Activity by Enhancing Autocrine Insulin-Like Growth Factor 2 Production and Optimizing Muscle .</a></h1><p>Insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) mRNA binding protein 2 (IMP2) was selectively deleted from adult mouse muscle; two phenotypes were observed: decreased accrual of skeletal muscle mass after weaning and reduced wheel-running activity but normal forced treadmill performance. Reduced wheel running occurs when mice are fed a high- diet but is normalized when mice consume standard chow. The two phenotypes are due to altered output from different IMP2 client mRNAs. The reduced fiber size of IMP2-deficient muscle is attributable, in part, to diminished autocrine Igf2 production; basal  phosphorylation of the insulin and IGF1 receptors is diminished, and Akt1 activation is selectively reduced. Gsk3α is disinhibited, and S536-phosphorylated ε subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 2B [eIF2Bε(S536)] is hyperphosphorylated. Protein synthesis is reduced despite unaltered mTOR complex 1 activity. The diet-dependent reduction in voluntary exercise is likely due to altered muscle , as contractile function is normal. IMP2-deficient muscle exhibits reduced fatty acid oxidation, due to a reduced abundance of mRNA of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα), an IMP2 client, and PPARα protein. IMP2-deficient muscle fibers treated with a mitochondrial uncoupler to increase electron flux, as occurs with exercise, exhibit reduced oxygen consumption from fatty acids, with higher oxygen consumption from glucose. The greater dependence on muscle glucose  during increased oxygen demand may promote central fatigue and thereby diminish voluntary activity.Copyright © 2019 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30257103>Copper transporter ATP7A interacts with IQGAP1, a Rac1 binding scaffolding protein: role in PDGF-induced VSMC migration and vascular remodeling.</a></h1><p>Vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) migration contributes to neointimal formation after vascular injury.

In cultured rat aortic SMCs, PDGF stimulation rapidly promoted ATP7A association with IQGAP1 and Rac1 and their translocation to the  rafts and leading edge. Cotransfection assay revealed that ATP7A directly bound to NH-terminal domain of IQGAP1. Functionally, either ATP7A or IQGAP1 depletion using siRNA significantly inhibited PDGF-induced VSMC migration without additive effects, suggesting that IQGAP1 and ATP7A are in the same axis to promote migration. Furthermore, IQGAP1 siRNA blocked PDGF-induced ATP7A association with Rac1 as well as its translocation to leading edge, while PDGF-induced IQGAP1 translocation was not affected by ATP7A siRNA or Cu chelator. Overexpression of mutant IQGAP1 lacking a Rac1 binding site prevented PDGF-induced translocation of Rac1, but not ATP7A, to the leading edge, thereby inhibiting lamellipodia formation and VSMC migration. In vivo, ATP7A colocalized with IQGAP1 at neointimal VSMCs in a mice wire injury model, while neointimal formation and extracellular matrix deposition induced by vascular injury were inhibited in ATP7A mutant mice with reduced Cu transporter function. In summary, IQGAP1 functions as ATP7A and Rac1 binding scaffolding protein to organize PDGF-dependent ATP7A translocation to the lamellipodial leading edge, thereby promoting VSMC migration and vascular remodeling.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30734928>Role of brain c-Jun N-terminal kinase 2 in the control of the insulin receptor and its relationship with cognitive performance in a high- diet pre-clinical model.</a></h1><p>Insulin resistance has negative consequences on the physiological functioning of the nervous system. The appearance of type 3 diabetes in the brain leads to the development of the sporadic form of Alzheimer's disease. The c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK), a subfamily of the Mitogen Activated Protein Kinases, are enzymes composed by three different isoforms with differential modulatory activity against the insulin receptor (IR) and its substrate. This research focused on understanding the regulatory role of JNK2 on the IR, as well as study the effect of a high- diet (HFD) in the brain. Our observations determined how JNK2 ablation did not induce compensatory responses in the expression of the other isoforms but led to an increase in JNKs total activity. HFD-fed animals also showed an increased activity profile of the JNKs. These animals also displayed endoplasmic reticulum stress and up-regulation of the protein  phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) and the suppressor of cytokine signalling 3 protein. Consequently, a reduction in insulin sensitivity was detected and it is correlated with a decrease on the signalling of the IR. Moreover, cognitive impairment was observed in all groups but only wild-type genotype animals fed with HFD showed neuroinflammatory responses. In conclusion, HFD and JNK2 absence cause alterations in normal cognitive activity by altering the signalling of the IR. These affectations are related to the appearance of endoplasmic reticulum stress and an increase in the levels of inhibitory proteins like PTP1B and suppressor of cytokine signalling 3 protein.

There is growing interest in the role of Chol precursors in the treatment of diseases. One sterol precursor, desmosterol (Des), is a potential pharmacological target for inflammatory and neurodegenerative disorders. However, elevating levels of the precursor 7-dehydrocholesterol (7-DHC) by inhibiting the enzyme 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase is linked to teratogenic outcomes. Thus, altering the sterol profile may either increase risk toward an adverse outcome or confer therapeutic benefit depending on the metabolite affected by the pharmacophore. In order to characterize any unknown activity of drugs on Chol biosynthesis, a chemical library of Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs was screened for the potential to modulate 7-DHC or Des levels in a neural cell line. Over 20% of the collection was shown to impact Chol biosynthesis, including 75 compounds that alter 7-DHC levels and 49 that modulate Des levels. Evidence is provided that three  kinase inhibitors, imatinib, ponatinib, and masitinib, elevate Des levels as well as other substrates of 24-dehydrocholesterol reductase, the enzyme responsible for converting Des to Chol. Additionally, the mechanism of action for ponatinib and masitinib was explored, demonstrating that protein levels are decreased as a result of treatment with these drugs.Copyright © 2018 Wages et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30150004>Whole body protein anabolism in COPD patients and healthy older adults is not enhanced by adding either carbohydrates or leucine to a serving of protein.</a></h1><p>Carbohydrates (CHO) and leucine (LEU) both have insulinotropic properties, and could therefore enhance the protein anabolic capacity of dietary proteins, which are important nutrients in preventing muscle loss in patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). LEU is also known to activate protein anabolic signaling pathways independent of insulin. Based on our previous findings in COPD, we hypothesized that whole body protein anabolism is enhanced to a comparable extent by the separate and combined co-ingestion of CHO and LEU with protein.To disentangle the protein anabolic effects of CHO and/or free LEU when co-ingested with a high-quality protein, we studied 10 patients with moderate to very severe COPD and dyspnea (GOLD: II-IV, mMRC dyspnea scale ≥ 2), at risk for muscle loss, and 10 healthy age- and gender-matched controls. On four occasions, in a single-blind randomized crossover design, each subject ingested a drink containing 0.6 g/kg -free mass (ffm) hydrolyzed casein protein with, a) no add-ons (protein), b) 0.3 g/kg ffm CHO (protein + CHO), c) 0.095 g/kg ffm leucine (protein + LEU), d) both add-ons (protein + CHO + LEU). Whole body protein breakdown (PB), protein synthesis (PS), and net protein balance (= PS - PB) were measured by IV primed and continuous infusion of L-[ring-H]-phenylalanine and L-[C,N]-. L-[N]-phenylalanine was added to the protein drinks to measure splanchnic extraction.In both groups, whole body PS, PB and net protein balance responses were comparable between the four protein drinks, despite higher postprandial plasma LEU concentrations for the LEU supplemented drinks (P < 0.05), and higher insulin concentrations for the CHO supplemented drinks as compared to the protein only drink (P < 0.05).Adding CHO and/or LEU to a serving of high-quality protein does not further augment whole body protein anabolism in dyspneic COPD patients at risk for muscle loss or healthy older adults.ClinicalTrials.gov; No. ; URL: www.clinicaltrials.gov.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd and European Society for Clinical Nutrition and .

However, in warm adaptation, ambient temperature cannot directly activate BAT by sympathetic nervous system. Mongolian gerbils exhibit a wider thermoneutral zone (26.5-38.9 °C). We hypothesized that BAT atrophied near the lower critical temperature and further atrophied near the upper critical temperature. Male gerbils were acclimated to 23 °C, 27 °C or 37 °C, respectively, for 3 weeks. Results showed that regulatory non-shivering thermogenesis did not change in gerbils acclimated to 27 °C compared with 23 °C group, whereas it was reduced by 43.5% in gerbils acclimated to 37 °C. Bigger  droplet in BAT was observed in gerbils acclimated to 27 °C and 37 °C compared with 23 °C group, while the expression of uncoupling protein 1 and  hydroxylase was only reduced in gerbils acclimated to 37 °C. Further, thermoneutral acclimation did not change BAT thermogenesis by down-regulation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator-1α, PR domain containing 16, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α or peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-γ gene expression in BAT. In addition, body temperature was reduced in gerbils acclimated to 37 °C compared with 23 °C group, which was associated with a decreased resting metabolic rate and regulatory non-shivering thermogenesis. In conclusion, BAT does not atrophy near the lower critical temperature, whereas it atrophies near the upper critical temperature, suggesting that BAT may play thermoregulatory role within the TNZ in Mongolian gerbils.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The mechanisms whereby BPD/DS exerts its positive metabolic effects have however yet to be fully delineated. The objective of this study was to distinguish the effects of the two components of BPD/DS, namely the sleeve gastrectomy (SG) and the DS derivation, on gut microbiota, and to appraise whether changes in microbial composition are linked with surgery-induced metabolic benefits.BPD/DS, DS, and SG were performed in Wistar rats fed a standard chow diet. Body weight and energy intake were measured daily during 8 weeks post-surgery, at which time glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), peptide   (PYY), insulin, and glucose were measured. Fecal samples were collected prior to surgery and at 2 and 8 weeks post-surgery. Intraluminal contents of the alimentary, biliopancreatic, and common limbs (resulting from BPD/DS) were taken from the proximal portion of each limb. Fecal and small intestinal limb samples were analyzed by 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing.BPD/DS and DS led to lower digestible energy intake (P = 0.0007 and P = 0.0002, respectively), reduced weight gain (P < 0.0001) and body  mass (P < 0.0001), improved glucose , and increased GLP-1 (P = 0.0437, SHAM versus DS) and PYY levels (P < 0.0001). These effects were associated with major alterations of both the fecal and small intestinal microbiota, as revealed by significant decrease in bacterial richness and diversity at 2 (P < 0.0001, Chao1 index; P < 0.0001, Shannon index) and 8 weeks (P = 0.0159, SHAM versus DS, Chao1 index; P = 0.0219, SHAM versus DS, P = 0.0472, SHAM versus BPD/DS, Shannon index) post-surgery in BPD/DS and DS, and increased proportions of Bifidobacteriales (a 60% increase in both groups) but reduced Clostridiales (a 50% decrease and a 90% decrease respectively), which were mostly accounted at the genus level by higher relative abundance of Bifidobacterium in both the fecal and intestinal limb samples, as well as reduced abundance of Peptostreptococcaceae and Clostridiaceae in the small intestine. Those effects were not seen in SG rats.The metabolic benefits following BPD/DS are seemingly due to the DS component of the surgery. Furthermore, BPD/DS causes marked alterations in fecal and small intestinal microbiota resulting in reduced bacterial diversity and richness. Our data further suggest that increased abundance of Bifidobacterium and reduced level of two Clostridiales species in the gut microbiota might contribute to the positive metabolic outcomes of BPD/DS.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30696032>Betanin, a Natural Food Additive: Stability, Bioavailability, Antioxidant and Preservative Ability Assessments.</a></h1><p>Betanin is the only betalain approved for use in food and pharmaceutical products as a natural red colorant. However, the antioxidant power and health-promoting properties of this pigment have been disregarded, perhaps due to the difficulty in obtaining a stable chemical compound, which impairs its absorption and  evaluation. Herein, betanin was purified by semi-preparative HPLC-LC/MS and identified by LC-ESI(+)-MS/MS as the pseudomolecular ion / 551.16. Betanin showed significant stability up to -30 °C and mild stability at chilling temperature. The stability and antioxidant ability of this compound were assessed during a human digestion simulation and ex vivo colon fermentation. Half of the betanin amount was recovered in the small intestine digestive fluid and no traces were found after colon fermentation. Betanin high antioxidant ability was retained even after simulated small intestine digestion. Betanin, besides displaying an inherent colorant capacity, was equally effective as a natural antioxidant displaying peroxy-radical scavenger ability in pork meat. Betanin should be considered a multi-functional molecule able to confer an attractive color to frozen or refrigerated foods, but with the capacity to avoid  oxidation, thereby preserving food quality. Long-term supplementation by beetroot, a rich source of betanin, should be stimulated to protect organisms against oxidative stress.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30385508>The melanization road more traveled by: Precursor substrate effects on melanin synthesis in cell-free and fungal cell systems.</a></h1><p>Natural brown-black eumelanin pigments confer structural coloration in animals and potently block ionizing radiation and antifungal drugs. These functions also make them attractive for bioinspired materials design, including coating materials for drug-delivery vehicles, strengthening agents for adhesive hydrogel materials, and free-radical scavengers for soil remediation. Nonetheless, the molecular determinants of the melanin "developmental road traveled" and the resulting architectural features have remained uncertain because of the insoluble, heterogeneous, and amorphous characteristics of these complex polymeric assemblies. Here, we used 2D solid-state NMR, EPR, and dynamic nuclear polarization spectroscopic techniques, assisted in some instances by the use of isotopically enriched precursors, to address several open questions regarding the molecular structures and associated functions of eumelanin. Our findings uncovered: 1) that the identity of the available catecholamine precursor alters the structure of melanin pigments produced either in  fungal cells or under cell-free conditions; 2) that the identity of the available precursor alters the scaffold organization and membrane  content of melanized fungal cells; 3) that the fungal cells are melanized preferentially by an l-DOPA precursor; and 4) that the macromolecular carbon- and nitrogen-based architecture of cell-free and fungal eumelanins includes indole, pyrrole, indolequinone, and open-chain building blocks that develop depending on reaction time. In conclusion, the availability of catecholamine precursors plays an important role in eumelanin development by affecting the efficacy of pigment formation, the melanin molecular structure, and its underlying scaffold in fungal systems.© 2018 Chatterjee et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31284513>Phenformin as an Anticancer Agent: Challenges and Prospects.</a></h1><p>Currently, there is increasing evidence linking diabetes mellitus (especially type 2 diabetes mellitus) with carcinogenesis through various biological processes, such as -induced chronic inflammation, hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, and angiogenesis. Chemotherapeutic agents are used in the treatment of cancer, but in most cases, patients develop resistance. Phenformin, an oral biguanide drug used to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus, was removed from the market due to a high risk of fatal lactic acidosis. However, it has been shown that phenformin is, with other biguanides, an authentic tumor disruptor, not only by the production of hypoglycemia due to caloric restriction through AMP-activated protein kinase with energy detection (AMPK) but also as a blocker of the mTOR regulatory complex. Moreover, the addition of phenformin eliminates resistance to antiangiogenic  kinase inhibitors (TKI), which prevent the uncontrolled  of glucose in tumor cells. In this review, we evidence the great potential of phenformin as an anticancer agent. We thoroughly review its mechanism of action and clinical trial assays, specially focusing on current challenges and future perspectives of this promising drug.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29913552>Decursin and Z-Ligustilide in  Root Extract Fermented by  Display Anti-Pigment Activity in Melanoma Cells.</a></h1><p>The anti-melanogenic effects of the extract of  (AT) root and the extract of AT root fermented by  () were investigated.

The current study further evaluated the effects and possible mechanisms of QGZST on epididymal white adipose tissue (eWAT) dysfunction in a high--diet (HFD)-fed-spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) model. Results showed that QGZST significantly decreased the systolic blood pressure (SBP), mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), body weights and adipocyte size of HFD-fed SHRs. Moreover, QGZST remarkably reduced the serum levels of cholesterol, triglyceride, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, fasting glucose, fasting insulin and HOMA-IR index, increased serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels and improved glucose intolerance in HFD-fed SHRs. Furthermore, QGZST dramatically attenuated HFD-fed-induced hypersecretion of proinflammatory cytokines and hypoproduction of adiponectin in SHRs. Mechanistically, QGZST stimulated the activity of Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) and Forkhead box protein O1 (FOXO1) and suppress the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPAR-γ), CCAAT-enhancer-binding proteins-α(C/EBP-α), fatty acid binding protein 4 (FABP4), acetylated nuclear factor-kappa-B-p65 (acetyl-NF-кB-p65) and protein- phosphatase 1B (PTP1B). More than that, QGZST also prevented acetyl-NF-кB-p65 nuclear accumulation. Collectively, our research demonstrated for the first time that QGZST is able to alleviate eWAT dysfunction with up-regulation of SIRT1 in HFD-fed SHRs, which might supply further insight into QGZST-mediated anti-hypertension and anti-obesity effects.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS.

Our recent work indicated that EGFR can also regulate  during liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy. Based on these findings, we investigated the role of EGFR in a mouse model of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) using a pharmacological inhibition strategy. C57BL6/J mice were fed a chow diet or a fast-food diet (FFD) with or without EGFR inhibitor (canertinib) for 2 months. EGFR inhibition completely prevented development of steatosis and liver injury in this model. In order to study if EGFR inhibition can reverse NAFLD progression, mice were fed the FFD for 5 months, with or without canertinib treatment for the last 5 weeks of the study. EGFR inhibition remarkably decreased steatosis, liver injury, and fibrosis and improved glucose tolerance. Microarray analysis revealed that ~40% of genes altered by the FFD were differentially expressed after EGFR inhibition and, thus, are potentially regulated by EGFR. Several genes and enzymes related to  (particularly fatty acid synthesis and lipolysis), which were disrupted by the FFD, were found to be modulated by EGFR. Several crucial transcription factors that play a central role in regulating these  genes during NAFLD, including peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ), sterol regulatory element-binding transcription factor 1 (SREBF1), carbohydrate-responsive element-binding protein, and hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha, were also found to be modulated by EGFR. In fact, chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that PPARγ binding to several crucial  genes (fatty acid synthase, stearoyl-coenzyme A desaturase 1, and perilipin 2) was drastically reduced by EGFR inhibition. Further upstream, EGFR inhibition suppressed AKT signaling, which is known to control these transcription factors, including PPARγ and SREBF1, in NAFLD models. Lastly, the effect of EGFR in FFD-induced fatty-liver phenotype was not shared by receptor  kinase MET, investigated using MET knockout mice. Conclusion: Our study revealed a role of EGFR in NAFLD and the potential of EGFR inhibition as a treatment strategy for NAFLD.© 2019 by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30928896>Deciphering the intervention mechanism of Taohong Siwu Decoction following the abnormal uterine bleeding rats based on serum metabolic profiles.</a></h1><p>Abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB), one of the most significant characters of incomplete abortion, is a widespread phenomenon in gynecological that put a woman into a terrible physiological and psychological state. Taohong Siwu Decoction (TSD) is a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) prescriptions which have treated AUB in China for decades. Our previous study elucidated that TSD reduced the volume of uterine bleedings as well as repaired the endometrium. The present study aims to investigate the mechanisms of TSD on AUB based on serum metabolomics. In this study, serum metabolic profile data was collected using ultra high-performance liquid chromatography with ion trap/time-of-flight mass spectrometry and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. 23 potential biomarkers (urea, serine, L-proline, L-glutamic acid, palmitic acid, l-acetylcarnitine, LysoPC(16:0), LysoPC(20:4), l-proline, linoleic acid, stearic acid, l-isoleucine, phenylalanine, , Oleic acid, et al) were eventually identified using multivariate statistical analysis (PCA and OPLS-DA) with VIP > 1, P < 0.05. Correlation analysis, fold-change (FC), area under receiver characteristic (ROC), false discovery rate (FDR) were used for data confirmation to ensure the authenticity of the data. The related-metabolic pathway mainly included amino acid  (Phenylalanine, , and tryptophan ; Valine, leucine and isoleucine biosynthesis; Arginine and proline ; Glycine, serine and threonine ) and  (linoleic acid , glycerophospholipid ).

Three different experimental conditions, namely ad libitum feeding; fasting for 24 h; fasting for 24 h and then refeeding for 2 h, were applied to study changes of the aforementioned target and its receptor (MCHR4) gene expression under different nutritional status. The relative changes of MCH and MCHR4 were also studied from 7 to 35 days of age. Expression of PMCH and MCHR4 along the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) was also investigated. We found that expression of both targets was significant in the hypothalamus, while only weak expression was detected along the GIT. Different nutritional states did not affect the PMCH and MCHR4 mRNA levels. However, fasting for 24 h had significantly increased the MCH-like immunoreactivity by 25.65%. Fasting for 24 h and then refeeding for 2 h had further significantly increased the MCH peptide concentration by 32.51%, as compared to the ad libitum state. A decreasing trend with age was observable for both, the PMCH and MCHR4 mRNA levels, and also for the MCH-like immunoreactivity. Correlation analysis did not result in a significant correlation between MCH peptide concentration and abdominal  mass in ad libitum fed birds. In conclusion, MCH peptide concentration altered in response to 24 h fasting, which indicated that this peptide may take part in feed intake regulation of broiler chickens.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30026196>Electrostatic lock in the transport cycle of the multidrug resistance transporter EmrE.</a></h1><p>EmrE is a small, homodimeric membrane transporter that exploits the established electrochemical proton gradient across the  inner membrane to export toxic polyaromatic cations, prototypical of the wider small-multidrug resistance transporter family. While prior studies have established many fundamental aspects of the specificity and rate of substrate transport in EmrE, low resolution of available structures has hampered identification of the transport coupling mechanism. Here we present a complete, refined atomic structure of EmrE optimized against available cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) data to delineate the critical interactions by which EmrE regulates its conformation during the transport process. With the model, we conduct molecular dynamics simulations of the transporter in explicit membranes to probe EmrE dynamics under different substrate loading and conformational states, representing different intermediates in the transport cycle. The refined model is stable under extended simulation. The water dynamics in simulation indicate that the hydrogen-bonding networks around a pair of solvent-exposed glutamate residues (E14) depend on the loading state of EmrE. One specific hydrogen bond from a  (Y60) on one monomer to a glutamate (E14) on the opposite monomer is especially critical, as it locks the protein conformation when the glutamate is deprotonated. The hydrogen bond provided by Y60 lowers the [Formula: see text] of one glutamate relative to the other, suggesting both glutamates should be protonated for the hydrogen bond to break and a substrate-free transition to take place. These findings establish the molecular mechanism for the coupling between proton transfer reactions and protein conformation in this proton-coupled secondary transporter.Copyright © 2018 the Author(s).

We aimed to investigate the role of gefitinib (EGFR- kinase inhibitor) in diabetic cardiomyopathy (DbCM).DbCM was induced by injecting streptozotocin (55 mg/kg for 5 consecutive days) to C57/BL6 mice intraperitoneally. Diabetic C57/BL6 mice (fasting blood glucose level ≥ 250 mg/dl) were allocated into four study groups and treated with two doses of gefitinib (30 mg/kg and 350 mg/kg per day) as well as ramipril (3 mg/kg/day) for four weeks.We observed a significant correlation between persistent hyperglycaemia with cardiac remodeling and alterations in myocardial architecture. Gefitinib significantly prevented  peroxidation (MDA), damage of antioxidant enzymes like superoxide dismutase (SOD), Catalase, glutathione (GSH) and thioredoxin reductase (TrxR). Gefitinib also prevented hypertrophy of myocardium evidenced by reduced heart weight to body weight ratio and TGF‑β related collagen deposition. Gefitinib maintained cardiac biomarkers like lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), Creatine Kinase‑MB, brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and cardiac Troponin‑I (cTroponinI) indicating reduced myocardial damage. Decreased sarcoplasmic endoplasmic reticulum Ca2 + ATPase2a (SERCA2a) and sodium‑calcium exchanger-1 (NCX1) protein depletion after gefitinib administration indicated improved Ca homeostasis during myocardial contractility. Histopathology and transmission electron microscopy clearly showed almost normal myofibrils and mitochondrial arrangements in gefitinib treated mice.Our findings suggest that gefitinib protects myocardial damage in DbCM via balancing oxidant-antioxidant system, decreased collagen deposition as well as improved CKMB, BNP, cTroponinI and SERCA2a/NCX-1. Thereby, it indicated that gefitinib may be a potential therapeutic drug for treating DbCM.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Here, we show that reduced survival caused by AXL overexpression can be mitigated by the expression of the GPI-anchored tumour suppressor OPCML Further, we demonstrate that AXL directly interacts with OPCML, preferentially so when AXL is activated by its ligand Gas6. As a consequence, AXL accumulates in cholesterol-rich  domains, where OPCML resides. Here, phospho-AXL is brought in proximity to the  domain-restricted phosphatase PTPRG, which de-phosphorylates the RTK/ligand complex.

Rats fed a diet with EY exhibited abundant neurons in the CA1 hippocampus and complete subcellular structures. Rats fed 132 g kg EW exhibited shrunken cells and swollen mitochondria. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor had constitutively low expression among groups, while  kinase B (TrkB) exhibited higher expression levels in rats fed a diet containing EY compared with other groups (P < 0.05).EY consumption reduced body weight and increased HDL levels. Diet containing EY could improve cognition through enhanced trkB expression. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry.© 2019 Society of Chemical Industry.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30447239>On association of the lethal yellow (A) mutation in the agouti gene with the alterations in mouse brain and behavior.</a></h1><p>Lethal yellow (A) mutation causes obesity and type-2 diabetes in mice. Here we studied the effect of the A mutation on the brain and behavior. The experiments were carried out on adult (11-12 weeks old) males of A/a mice and their wild-type littermates (a/a). Mice of A/a and a/a genotypes did not differ in their home cage activity, sleep, food and water consumption, learning ability in the Morris water maze, anxiety in the open field and elevated plus-maze, as well as in the level of monoamines, metabolites and some genes expression in the brain. At the same time, the  mass, depressive-like immobility in the forced swim and tail suspension tests were significantly increased in A/a mice compared with a/a ones. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a significant reduction of cortex volume in A/a mice. The level of mRNA of Ptpn5 gene encoding striatal enriched  phosphatase in the frontal cortex of A/a mice was significantly elevated compared with their wild-type littermates. This is the first report on the alterations in the brain and behavior in the A/a mouse line. It is tempting to speculate that this mouse line can serve as a new and useful preclinical model to study neurobehavioral complications associated with obesity and type-2 diabetes.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

How the different cell wall polymers are assembled in a coordinated fashion is not fully understood. Here, we reconstitute Staphylococcus aureus CP biosynthesis and elucidate its interplay with the cell wall biosynthetic machinery. We show that the CapAB  kinase complex controls multiple enzymatic checkpoints through reversible phosphorylation to modulate the consumption of essential precursors that are also used in peptidoglycan biosynthesis. In addition, the CapA1 activator protein interacts with and cleaves -linked CP precursors, releasing the essential  carrier undecaprenyl-phosphate. We further provide biochemical evidence that the subsequent attachment of CP is achieved by LcpC, a member of the LytR-CpsA-Psr protein family, using the peptidoglycan precursor native  II as acceptor substrate. The Ser/Thr kinase PknB, which can sense cellular  II levels, negatively controls CP synthesis. Our work sheds light on the integration of CP biosynthesis into the multi-component Gram-positive cell wall.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31611846>Shared Autonomic Pathways Connect Bone Marrow and Peripheral Adipose Tissues Across the Central Neuraxis.</a></h1><p>Bone marrow adipose tissue (BMAT) is increased in both obesity and anorexia. This is unique relative to white adipose tissue (WAT), which is generally more attuned to metabolic demand. It suggests that there may be regulatory pathways that are common to both BMAT and WAT and also those that are specific to BMAT alone. The central nervous system (CNS) is a key mediator of adipose tissue function through sympathetic adrenergic neurons. Thus, we hypothesized that central autonomic pathways may be involved in BMAT regulation. To test this, we first quantified the innervation of BMAT by  hydroxylase (TH) positive nerves within the metaphysis and diaphysis of the tibia of B6 and C3H mice. We found that many of the TH+ axons were concentrated around central blood vessels in the bone marrow. However, there were also areas of free nerve endings which terminated in regions of BMAT adipocytes. Overall, the proportion of nerve-associated BMAT adipocytes increased from proximal to distal along the length of the tibia (from ~3-5 to ~14-24%), regardless of mouse strain. To identify the central pathways involved in BMAT innervation and compare to peripheral WAT, we then performed retrograde viral tract tracing with an attenuated pseudorabies virus (PRV) to infect efferent nerves from the tibial metaphysis (inclusive of BMAT) and inguinal WAT (iWAT) of C3H mice. PRV positive neurons were identified consistently from both injection sites in the intermediolateral horn of the spinal cord, reticular formation, rostroventral medulla, solitary tract, periaqueductal gray, locus coeruleus, subcoeruleus, Barrington's nucleus, and hypothalamus. We also observed dual-PRV infected neurons within the majority of these regions. Similar tracings were observed in pons, midbrain, and hypothalamic regions from B6 femur and tibia, demonstrating that these results persist across mouse strains and between skeletal sites. Altogether, this is the first quantitative report of BMAT autonomic innervation and reveals common central neuroanatomic pathways, including putative "command" neurons, involved in coordinating multiple aspects of sympathetic output and facilitation of parallel processing between bone marrow/BMAT and peripheral adipose tissue.Copyright © 2019 Wee, Lorenz, Bekirov, Jacquin and Scheller.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31611073>Class I phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) regulatory subunits and their roles in signaling and disease.</a></h1><p>The Class I phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks) are a group of heterodimeric  kinases that regulate crucial cellular processes including proliferation, survival, growth, and . The diversity in functions controlled by the various catalytic isoforms (p110α, p110β, p110δ, and p110γ) depends on their abilities to be activated by distinct stimuli such as receptor  kinases (RTKs), G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), and the Ras family of small G-proteins. A major factor determining the ability of each p110 enzyme to be activated is the presence of regulatory binding partners. Given the overwhelming evidence for the involvement of PI3Ks in diseases such as cancer, inflammation, immunodeficiency and diabetes, an understanding of how these regulatory proteins influence PI3K function is essential.

To understand the role of FGF21 in regulating tumor aggressiveness in thyroid cancer, serum levels of FGF21 were measured in healthy subjects and patients with papillary thyroid cancer (PTC), and expression levels of FGF21, FGF receptors (FGFRs), and β-klotho (KLB) were investigated in human thyroid tissues. The cell viability, migrating cells, and invading cells were measured in PTC cells after treatment with recombinant FGF21. Higher serum levels of FGF21 were found in patients with thyroid cancer than in control participants, and were significantly associated with body mass index (BMI), fasting glucose levels, triglyceride levels, tumor stage, lymphovascular invasion, and recurrence. Serum FGF21 levels were positively correlated with the BMI in patients with PTC, and significantly associated with recurrence. Recombinant FGF21 led to tumor aggressiveness via activation of the FGFR signaling axis and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) signaling in PTC cells, and AZD4547, an FGFR  kinase inhibitor, attenuated the effects of FGF21. Hence, FGF21 may be a new biomarker for predicting tumor progression, and targeting FGFR may be a novel therapy for the treatment of obese patients with PTC.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30114292>Orthologous proteins of experimental de- and remyelination are differentially regulated in the CSF proteome of multiple sclerosis subtypes.</a></h1><p>Here, we applied a multi-omics approach (i) to examine molecular pathways related to de- and remyelination in multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions; and (ii) to translate these findings to the CSF proteome in order to identify molecules that are differentially expressed among MS subtypes.To relate differentially expressed genes in MS lesions to de- and remyelination, we compared transcriptome of MS lesions to transcriptome of cuprizone (CPZ)-induced de- and remyelination. Protein products of the overlapping orthologous genes were measured within the CSF by quantitative proteomics, parallel reaction monitoring (PRM). Differentially regulated proteins were correlated with molecular markers of inflammation by using MesoScale multiplex immunoassay. Expression kinetics of differentially regulated orthologous genes and proteins were examined in the CPZ model.In the demyelinated and remyelinated corpus callosum, we detected 1239 differentially expressed genes; 91 orthologues were also differentially expressed in MS lesions. Pathway analysis of these orthologues suggested that the TYROBP (DAP12)-TREM2 pathway, TNF-receptor 1, CYBA and the proteasome subunit PSMB9 were related to de- and remyelination. We designed 129 peptides representing 51 orthologous proteins, measured them by PRM in 97 individual CSF, and compared their levels between relapsing (n = 40) and progressive MS (n = 57). Four proteins were differentially regulated among relapsing and progressive MS:  protein kinase receptor UFO (UFO), TIMP-1, apolipoprotein C-II (APOC2), and beta-2-microglobulin (B2M). The orthologous genes/proteins in the mouse brain peaked during acute remyelination. UFO, TIMP-1 and B2M levels correlated inversely with inflammation in the CSF (IL-6, MCP-1/CCL2, TARC/CCL17). APOC2 showed positive correlation with IL-2, IL-16 and eotaxin-3/CCL26.Pathology-based multi-omics identified four CSF markers that were differentially expressed in MS subtypes.

DM is characterized by the elevation of blood glucose due either to a defect in insulin synthesis, secretion, binding to receptor, or an increase of insulin resistance. The internal and external factors such as obesity, urbanizations, and genetic mutations could increase the risk of developing DM. Flavonoids are phenolic compounds existing as secondary metabolites in fruits and vegetables as well as fungi. Their structure consists of 15 carbon skeletons and two aromatic rings (A and B) connected by three carbon chains. Flavonoids are furtherly classified into 6 subclasses: flavonols, flavones, flavanones, isoflavones, flavanols, and anthocyanidins. Naturally occurring flavonoids possess anti-diabetic effects. As in vitro and animal model's studies demonstrate, they have the ability to prevent diabetes and its complications. The aim of this review is to summarize the current knowledge addressing the antidiabetic effects of dietary flavonoids and their underlying molecular mechanisms on selected pathways: Glucose transporter, hepatic enzymes,  kinase inhibitor, AMPK, PPAR, and NF-κB. Flavonoids improve the pathogenesis of diabetes and its complications through the regulation of glucose , hepatic enzymes activities, and a  profile. Most studies illustrate a positive role of specific dietary flavonoids on diabetes, but the mechanisms of action and the side effects need more clarification. Overall, more research is needed to provide a better understanding of the mechanisms of diabetes treatment using flavonoids.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31660449>Dietary Exposure to Transgenic Rice Expressing the Spider Silk Protein Fibroin Reduces Blood Glucose Levels in Diabetic Mice: The Potential Role of Insulin Receptor Substrate-1 Phosphorylation in Adipocytes.</a></h1><p>Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is characterized by insulin resistance (IR). T2DM is correlated with obesity and most T2DM medications have been developed for enhancing insulin sensitivity. Silk protein fibroin (SPF) from spiders has been suggested as an attractive biomaterial for medical purposes. We generated transgenic rice (TR) expressing SPF and fed it to diabetic BKS.Cg-m+/+Lepr mice to monitor the changes in blood glucose levels and adipose tissue proteins associated with energy  and insulin signaling. In the present study, the adipocyte size in abdominal  in TR-SPF-fed mice was remarkably smaller than that of the control. Whereas the adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-activated protein kinase and insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) protein levels were increased in abdominal adipose tissues after TR-SPF feeding, levels of six-transmembrane protein of prostate 2 (STAMP2) proteins decreased. Phosphorylation of AMPK at threonine 172 and IRS1 at serine 307 and  632 were both increased in adipose tissues from TR-SPF-fed mice. Increased expression and phosphorylation of IRS1 at both serine 307 and  632 in adipose tissues indicated that adipocytes obtained from abdominal  in TR-SPF-fed mice were more susceptible to insulin signaling than that of the control. STAMP2 protein levels decreased in adipose tissues from TR-SPF-fed mice, indicating that STAMP2 proteins were reducing adipocytes that were undergoing lipolysis. Taken together, this study showed that TR-SPF was effective in reducing blood glucose levels in diabetic mice and that concurrent lipolysis in abdominal adipocytes was associated with alterations of AMPK, IRS1, and STAMP2. Increased IRS1 expression and its phosphorylation by TR-SFP were considered to be particularly important in the induction of lipolysis in adipocytes, as well as in reducing blood glucose levels in this animal model.© Copyright 2019 The Korean Society of Developmental Biology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31614337>Metabolic impact of pheochromocytoma/paraganglioma: Targeted metabolomics in patients before and after tumor removal.</a></h1><p>Excess catecholamine release by pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas (PPGL) leads to characteristic clinical features and increased morbidity and mortality.

Receptor engagement leads to activation of specific protein  kinases, which then phosphorylate multiple enzymes and adapter proteins. One such enzyme, phospholipase-Cγ1, is responsible for cleavage of a plasma membrane  substrate, a phosphoinositide, into two second messengers, diacylglycerol, which activates several enzymes including protein kinase C, and an inositol phosphate, which induces intracellular calcium elevation. In T cells, phospholipase-Cγ1 is recruited to the plasma membrane as part of a four-protein complex containing three adapter molecules. We have used recombinant proteins and synthetic phosphopeptides to reconstitute this quaternary complex in vitro. Extending biophysical tools to study concurrent interactions of the four protein components, we demonstrated the formation and determined the composition of the quaternary complex using multisignal analytical ultracentrifugation, and we characterized the thermodynamic driving forces of assembly by isothermal calorimetry. We demonstrate that the four proteins reversibly associate in a circular arrangement of binding interfaces, each protein interacting with two others. Three interactions are of high affinity, and the fourth is of low affinity, with the assembly of the quaternary complex exhibiting significant enthalpy-entropy compensation as in an entropic switch. Formation of this protein complex enables subsequent recruitment of additional molecules needed to activate phospholipase-Cγ1. Understanding the formation of this complex is fundamental to full characterization of a central pathway in T cell activation. Such knowledge is critical to developing ways in which this pathway can be selectively inhibited.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30841604>Ageing Investigation Using Two-Time-Point Metabolomics Data from KORA and CARLA Studies.</a></h1><p>Ageing, one of the largest risk factors for many complex diseases, is highly interconnected to metabolic processes. Investigating the changes in metabolite concentration during ageing among healthy individuals offers us unique insights to healthy ageing. We aim to identify ageing-associated metabolites that are independent from chronological age to deepen our understanding of the long-term changes in metabolites upon ageing. Sex-stratified longitudinal analyses were performed using fasting serum samples of 590 healthy KORA individuals (317 women and 273 men) who participated in both baseline (KORA S4) and seven-year follow-up (KORA F4) studies. Replication was conducted using serum samples of 386 healthy CARLA participants (195 women and 191 men) in both baseline (CARLA-0) and four-year follow-up (CARLA-1) studies. Generalized estimation equation models were performed on each metabolite to identify ageing-associated metabolites after adjusting for baseline chronological age, body mass index, physical activity, smoking status, alcohol intake and systolic blood pressure. Literature researches were conducted to understand their biochemical relevance. Out of 122 metabolites analysed, we identified and replicated five (C18, arginine, ornithine, serine and ) and four (arginine, ornithine, PC aa C36:3 and PC ae C40:5) significant metabolites in women and men respectively. Arginine decreased, while ornithine increased in both sexes. These metabolites are involved in several ageing processes: apoptosis, mitochondrial dysfunction, inflammation, , autophagy and oxidative stress resistance. The study reveals several significant ageing-associated metabolite changes with two-time-point measurements on healthy individuals.

Therefore, we examined whether florbetapir, a radiopharmaceutical agent used for detection of amyloid-β deposits in the brain, also allows identification of islet amyloid in the pancreas.Saturation binding assays were used to determine the affinity of florbetapir for human islet amyloid polypeptide (hIAPP) aggregates in vitro. Islet amyloid-prone transgenic mice that express hIAPP in their beta cells and amyloid-free non-transgenic control mice were used to examine the ability of florbetapir to detect islet amyloid deposits in vitro, in vivo and ex vivo. Mice or mouse pancreases were subjected to autoradiographic, histochemical and/or positron emission tomography (PET) analyses to assess the utility of florbetapir in identifying islet amyloid.In vitro, florbetapir bound synthetic hIAPP fibrils with a dissociation constant of 7.9 nmol/l. Additionally, florbetapir bound preferentially to amyloid-containing hIAPP transgenic vs amyloid-free non-transgenic mouse pancreas sections in vitro, as determined by autoradiography (16,475 ± 5581 vs 5762 ± 575 density/unit area, p < 0.05). In hIAPP transgenic and non-transgenic mice fed a high- diet for 1 year, intravenous administration of florbetapir followed by PET scanning showed that the florbetapir signal was significantly higher in amyloid-laden hIAPP transgenic vs amyloid-free non-transgenic pancreases in vivo during the first 5 min of the scan (36.83 ± 2.22 vs 29.34 ± 2.03 standardised uptake value × min, p < 0.05). Following PET, pancreases were excised and florbetapir uptake was determined ex vivo by γ counting. Pancreatic uptake of florbetapir was significantly correlated with the degree of islet amyloid deposition, the latter assessed by histochemistry (r = 0.74, p < 0.001).Florbetapir binds to islet amyloid deposits in a specific and quantitative manner. In the future, florbetapir may be useful as a non-invasive tool to identify islet amyloid deposits in humans.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31664798>Hepatocellular Carcinoma [Internet].</a></h1><p>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most common form of liver cancer, has become a major global health problem.

However, the biological mechanisms responsible for these associations remain largely unknown. In order to gain insight into the  processes driving the association of leukocyte telomere length (LTL) with age-related diseases, we investigated the association between LTL and serum metabolite levels in 7,853 individuals from seven independent cohorts. LTL was determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction and the levels of 131 serum metabolites were measured with mass spectrometry in biological samples from the same blood draw. With partial correlation analysis, we identified six metabolites that were significantly associated with LTL after adjustment for multiple testing: lysophosphatidylcholine acyl C17:0 (lysoPC a C17:0, p-value = 7.1 × 10), methionine (p-value = 9.2 × 10),  (p-value = 2.1 × 10), phosphatidylcholine diacyl C32:1 (PC aa C32:1, p-value = 2.4 × 10), hydroxypropionylcarnitine (C3-OH, p-value = 2.6 × 10), and phosphatidylcholine acyl-alkyl C38:4 (PC ae C38:4, p-value = 9.0 × 10). Pathway analysis showed that the three phosphatidylcholines and methionine are involved in homocysteine  and we found supporting evidence for an association of lipid  with LTL. In conclusion, we found longer LTL associated with higher levels of lysoPC a C17:0 and PC ae C38:4, and with lower levels of methionine, , PC aa C32:1, and C3-OH.

Although RTT has been associated with obesity, the underlying mechanism has not yet been elucidated. In this study, female heterozygous Mecp2-null mice (Mecp2+/- mice), a model of RTT, were fed a normal chow diet or high- diet (HFD), and the changes in molecular signaling pathways were investigated. Specifically, we examined the expression of genes related to the hypothalamus and dopamine reward circuitry, which represent a central network of feeding behavior control. In particular, dopamine reward circuitry has been shown to regulate hedonic feeding behavior, and its disruption is associated with HFD-related changes in palatability. The Mecp2+/- mice that were fed the normal chow showed normal body weight and food consumption, whereas those fed the HFD showed extreme obesity with hyperphagia, an increase of body  mass, glucose intolerance, and insulin resistance compared with wild-type mice fed the HFD (WT-HFD mice). The main cause of obesity in Mecp2+/--HFD mice was a remarkable increase in calorie intake, with no difference in oxygen consumption or locomotor activity. Agouti-related peptide mRNA and protein levels were increased, whereas proopiomelanocortin mRNA and protein levels were reduced in Mecp2+/--HFD mice with hyperleptinemia, which play an essential role in appetite and satiety in the hypothalamus. The conditioned place preference test revealed that Mecp2+/- mice preferred the HFD.  hydroxylase and dopamine transporter mRNA levels in the ventral tegmental area, and dopamine receptor and dopamine- and cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein mRNA levels in the nucleus accumbens were significantly lower in Mecp2+/--HFD mice than those of WT-HFD mice. Thus, HFD feeding induced dysregulation of food intake in the hypothalamus and dopamine reward circuitry, and accelerated the development of extreme obesity associated with addiction-like eating behavior in Mecp2+/- mice.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30853567>Influence of nutritional  on cognition and functional connectivity in healthy old humans.</a></h1><p> is precursor for monoamine neurotransmitters such as dopamine (DA), which is one of the key neurotransmitters in the frontostriatal network and of crucial relevance for mental disorders. Recent research reported that high dose  application resulted in increased brain DA synthesis, which is consistent with the observation of positive associations between daily  intake and cognitive test performance. In the present study, we investigated the associations between working memory (WM) dependent tasks and self-reported nutritional  intake within a large group of healthy elderly humans (286 subjects) by additionally including brain functional data. We observed a negative correlation between  intake and resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) between the striatum (putamen) and the prefrontal cortex.

Although genetic predisposition and epigenetic factors contribute to the development of NAFLD, our understanding of the molecular mechanism involved in the pathogenesis of the disease is still emerging. Here we investigated a possible role of a microRNAs-STAT3 pathway in the induction of hepatic steatosis. Differentiated HepaRG cells treated with the fatty acid sodium oleate (fatty dHepaRG) recapitulated features of liver vesicular steatosis and activated a cell-autonomous inflammatory response, inducing STAT3--phosphorylation. With a genome-wide approach (Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Sequencing), many phospho-STAT3 binding sites were identified in fatty dHepaRG cells and several STAT3 and/or NAFLD-regulated microRNAs showed increased expression levels, including miR-21. Innovative CARS (Coherent Anti-Stokes Raman Scattering) microscopy revealed that chemical inhibition of STAT3 activity decreased  accumulation and deregulated STAT3-responsive microRNAs, including miR-21, in  overloaded dHepaRG cells. We were able to show in vivo that reducing phospho-STAT3-miR-21 levels in C57/BL6 mice liver, by long-term treatment with metformin, protected mice from aging-dependent hepatic vesicular steatosis.

The MSP/Ron receptor axis has been shown to have anti-inflammatory properties in a number of mouse models, due at least in part, to its ability to limit pro-inflammatory responses in tissue-resident macrophages and hepatocytes. In this study, we established the role of the Ron receptor in steatohepatitis-induced hepatic fibrosis using Ron ligand domain knockout mice on an apolipoprotein E knockout background (DKO). After 18 weeks of high- high-cholesterol feeding, loss of Ron activation resulted in exacerbated NASH-associated steatosis which is precedent to hepatocellular injury, inflammation and fibrosis. H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)-based metabolomics identified significant changes in serum metabolites that can modulate the intrahepatic  pool in hepatic steatosis. Serum from DKO mice had higher concentrations of lipids, VLDL/LDL and pyruvate, whereas glycine levels were reduced. Parallel to the aggravated steatohepatitis, increased accumulation of collagen, inflammatory immune cells and collagen producing-myofibroblasts were seen in the livers of DKO mice. Gene expression profiling revealed that DKO mice exhibited elevated expression of genes encoding Ron receptor ligand MSP, collagens, ECM remodeling proteins and pro-fibrogenic cytokines in the liver.

The CRF was induced by gavage of 250 mg·kg·d adenine for 21 d. UPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS technique was used in combination with principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) to analyze the urine metabolic profiles in three groups. The endogenous substances with the variable importance projection (VIP)>1 and <0.05 were screened as the potential biomarkers for CRF, and enrichment analysis of metabolic pathways was carried out.Compared with the normal control group, the model group had lower body weight, higher kidney coefficient, higher serum creatinine and urea nitrogen levels (all <0.01), while the above indexes in the Niaoduqing group were ameliorated compared with the model group (all <0.01). Fifteen potential biomarkers were found in the urine of the model group, which were involved in 9 metabolic pathways including phenylalanine,  and tryptophan biosynthesis, glyoxylate and dicarboxylate , valine, leucine and isoleucine biosynthesis, arachidonic acid , cysteine and methionine , tricarboxylic acid cycle, glycerophosphatide , tryptophan  and  .Niaoduqing granules has therapeutic effect on rats with CRF, which may be related to the regulation of amino acid ,  and energy .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29854828>Acute Neuroinflammatory Response in the Substantia Nigra Pars Compacta of Rats after a Local Injection of Lipopolysaccharide.</a></h1><p>Models of Parkinson's disease with neurotoxins have shown that microglial activation does not evoke a typical inflammatory response in the substantia nigra, questioning whether neuroinflammation leads to neurodegeneration. To address this issue, the archetypal inflammatory stimulus, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), was injected into the rat substantia nigra. LPS induced fever, sickness behavior, and microglial activation (OX42 immunoreactivity), followed by astrocyte activation and leukocyte infiltration (GFAP and CD45 immunoreactivities). During the acute phase of neuroinflammation, pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-, IL-1, IL-6, IL-4, and IL-10) responded differentially at mRNA and protein level. Increased NO production and  peroxidation occurred at 168 h after LPS injection. At this time, evidence of neurodegeneration could be seen, entailing decreased  hydroxylase (TH) immunoreactivity, irregular body contour, and prolongation discontinuity of TH cells, as well as apparent phagocytosis of TH cells by OX42 cells. Altogether, these results show that LPS evokes a typical inflammatory response in the substantia nigra that is followed by dopaminergic neurodegeneration.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30581533>Redox Profiling Reveals Clear Differences between Molecular Patterns of Wound Fluids from Acute and Chronic Wounds.</a></h1><p>Wound healing is a complex multiphase process which can be hampered by many factors including impaired local circulation, hypoxia, infection, malnutrition, immunosuppression, and metabolic dysregulation in diabetes. Redox dysregulation is a common feature of many skin diseases demonstrated by virtually all cell types in the skin with overproduction of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species. The objective of this study was to characterize the redox environment in wound fluids and sera from patients suffering from chronic leg ulcers ( = 19) and acute wounds (bulla fluids from second degree burns;  = 11) with serum data also compared to those from healthy volunteers ( = 7). Significantly higher concentrations of TNF-, interleukine-8, vascular endothelial growth factor, and lactate dehydrogenase (measure of cell damage) were found in fluids from chronic wounds compared to acute ones. The extent of protein carbonylation (measure of protein oxidation),  peroxidation, and  nitration (indicator of peroxynitrite production) was similar in acute and chronic wound fluids, while radical scavenging activity and glutathione (GSH) levels were elevated in chronic wound fluids compared to acute wounds. Sera were also assessed for the same set of parameters with no significant differences detected. Nitrotyrosine (the footprint of the potent oxidant peroxynitrite) and poly(ADP-ribose) (the product of the DNA damage sensor enzyme PARP-1) could be detected in wound biopsies. Our data identify multiple signs of redox stress in chronic wounds with notable differences. In chronic wounds, elevations in antioxidant levels/activities may indicate compensatory mechanisms against inflammation. The presence of nitrotyrosine and poly(ADP-ribose) in tissues from venous leg ulcers indicate peroxynitrite production and PARP activation in chronic wounds.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30844580>Perfluoroalkyl substances, metabolomic profiling, and alterations in glucose homeostasis among overweight and obese Hispanic children: A proof-of-concept analysis.</a></h1><p>To examine the prospective associations between exposure to perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) and longitudinal measurements of glucose  in high-risk overweight and obese Hispanic children.Forty overweight and obese Hispanic children (8-14 years) from urban Los Angeles underwent clinical measures and 2-hour oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTT) at baseline and a follow-up visit (range: 1-3 years after enrollment). Baseline plasma perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorohexane sulfonic acid (PFHxS), and the plasma metabolome were measured by liquid-chromatography with high-resolution mass spectrometry. Multiple linear regression models were used to assess the association between baseline PFASs and changes in glucose homeostasis over follow-up. A metabolome-wide association study coupled with pathway enrichment analysis was performed to evaluate metabolic dysregulation associated with plasma PFASs concentrations. We performed a structural integrated analysis aiming to characterize the joint impact of all factors and to identify latent clusters of children with alterations in glucose homeostasis, based on their exposure and metabolomics profile.Each ln (ng/ml) increase in PFOA and PFHxS concentrations was associated with a 30.6 mg/dL (95% CI: 8.8-52.4) and 10.2 mg/dL (95% CI: 2.7-17.7) increase in 2-hour glucose levels, respectively. A ln (ng/ml) increase in PFHxS concentrations was also associated with 17.8 mg/dL increase in the glucose area under the curve (95% CI: 1.5-34.1). Pathway enrichment analysis showed significant alterations of lipids (e.g., glycosphingolipids, linoleic acid, and de novo lipogenesis), and amino acids (e.g., aspartate and asparagine, , arginine and proline) in association to PFASs exposure. The integrated analysis identified a cluster of children with increased 2-h glucose levels over follow up, characterized by increased PFAS levels and altered metabolite patterns.This proof-of-concept analysis shows that higher PFAS exposure was associated with dysregulation of several  and amino acid pathways and longitudinal alterations in glucose homeostasis in Hispanic youth. Larger studies are needed to confirm these findings and fully elucidate the underlying biological mechanisms.Copyright © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd..

Emerging evidence suggests that deposition of intracellular  droplets (LDs) participates in lipotoxicity and precedes neurodegeneration. Perilipin family members were recognized to facilitate LD movement and cellular signaling interactions. However, the direct interaction between Perilipin-regulated LD deposition and mitochondrial dysfunction in dopaminergic (DA) neurons remains obscure. Here, we demonstrate a novel type of  dysregulation involved in PD progression as evidenced by upregulated expression of Plin4 (a coating protein and regulator of LDs), and increased intracellular LD deposition that correlated with the loss of TH-ir ( hydroxylase-immunoreactive) neurons in the MPTP/p-induced PD model mouse mesencephalon. Further,  experiments showed that inhibition of LD storage by downregulating Plin4 promoted survival of SH-SY5Y cells. Mechanistically, reduced LD storage restored autophagy, leading to alleviation of mitochondrial damage, which in turn promoted cell survival. Moreover, the parkin-poly-Ub-p62 pathway was involved in this Plin4/LD-induced inhibition of mitophagy. These findings were further confirmed in primary cultures of DA-nergic neurons, in which autophagy inhibitor treatment significantly countermanded the ameliorations conferred by Plin4 silencing. Collectively, these experiments demonstrate that a dysfunctional Plin4/LD/mitophagy axis is involved in PD pathology and suggest Plin4-LDs as a potential biomarker as well as therapeutic strategy for PD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30178349>Novel Redox Active  Mutations Enhance the Regeneration of Functional Oxyhemoglobin from Methemoglobin: Implications for Design of Blood Substitutes.</a></h1><p>Heme mediated oxidative toxicity has been linked to adverse side effects in Hemoglobin Based Oxygen Carriers (HBOC), initiated by reactive ferryl (Fe) iron and globin based free radical species. We recently showed that the addition of a redox active  residue in the beta subunit (βF41Y) of recombinant hemoglobin had the capability to decrease  peroxidation by facilitating the reduction of Fe iron by plasma antioxidants such as ascorbate. In order to explore this functionality further we created a suite of  mutants designed to be accessible for both reductant access at the protein surface, yet close enough to the heme cofactor to enable efficient electron transfer to the Fe. The residues chosen were: βF41Y; βK66Y; βF71Y; βT84Y; βF85Y; and βL96Y. As with βF41Y, all mutants significantly enhanced the rate of ferryl (Fe) to ferric (Fe) reduction by ascorbate. However, surprisingly a subset of these mutations (βT84Y, and βF85Y) also enhanced the further reduction of ferric (Fe) to ferrous (Fe) heme, regenerating functional oxyhemoglobin. The largest increase was seen in βT84Y with the percentage of oxyhemoglobin formed from ferric hemoglobin in the presence of 100 μM ascorbate over a time period of 60 min increasing from 10% in βF41Y to over 50% in βT84Y. This increase was accompanied by an increased rate of ascorbate consumption. We conclude that the insertion of novel redox active  residues may be a useful component of any recombinant HBOC designed for longer functional activity without oxidative side effects.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31011795>High- diet promotes adrenaline production by visceral adipocytes.</a></h1><p>Catecholamines (CA) play a major role in  and immune response. Recent reports showing adipose tissue can synthetize CA enlighten new roles for these amines in obesity. This study aimed to evaluate the expression of both  hydroxylase (TH) and phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT) and CA content along preadipocytes differentiation, under normal and obesigenic conditions.8-9 week-old male C57BL/6 mice were divided in two groups: one fed with a high- diet (HFD) and other with a standard diet (SD) for 20 weeks. Afterwards, both TH and PNMT expression, localization, and CA content in adipocytes, were evaluated.qPCR results showed no changes for TH and PNMT expression during the differentiation process for visceral and subcutaneous preadipocytes from mice fed with SD. Comparing to SD, HFD increased TH gene expression of subcutaneous preadipocytes and PNMT gene expression of both visceral preadipocytes and adipocytes. HPLC-ED analyses revealed HFD increased visceral adipocytes noradrenaline intracellular content comparing with preadipocytes (p = 0.037). When compared with SD, HFD raised and decreased noradrenaline content, respectively, in visceral adipocytes (p = 0.004) and subcutaneous preadipocytes (p = 0.001). Along the differentiation process, HFD increased visceral adrenaline intracellular content comparing with SD (p < 0.001). HFD increased visceral comparing to subcutaneous adrenaline content for both preadipocytes (p = 0.004) and adipocytes (p = 0.001).TH and PNMT expression in adipose tissue is differently modulated in visceral and subcutaneous adipose depots, and seems to depend on diet. Differences observed in visceral adipose CA handling in HFD-fed mice might uncover novel pharmacological/nutritional strategies against obesity and cardiovascular risk.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30297846>Beauvericin inhibits melanogenesis by regulating cAMP/PKA/CREB and LXR-α/p38 MAPK-mediated pathways.</a></h1><p>Melanogenesis is the process of production of melanin pigments that are responsible for the colors of skin, eye, and hair and provide protection from ultraviolet radiation. However, excessive levels of melanin formation cause hyperpigmentation disorders such as freckles, melasma, and age spots. Liver X receptors (LXR) are nuclear oxysterol receptors belonging to the family of ligand-activated transcription factors and physiological regulators of  and cholesterol . In the skin, activation of LXRs stimulates differentiation of keratinocytes and augments  synthesis in sebocytes. However, the function of LXRs in melanogenesis has not been clearly elucidated. In addition, although beauvericin, a well-known mycotoxin primarily isolated from several fungi, has various biological properties, its involvement in melanogenesis has not been reported. Therefore, in this study, we examined the effects of beauvericin on melanogenesis and its molecular mechanisms. Beauvericin decreased melanin content and tyrosinase activity without any cytotoxicity. Beauvericin also reduced protein levels of MITF, tyrosinase, TRP1, and TRP2. In addition, beauvericin suppressed cAMP-PKA-CREB signaling and upregulated expression of LXR-α, resulting in the suppression of p38 MAPK. Our results indicate that beauvericin attenuates melanogenesis by regulating both cAMP/PKA/CREB and LXR-α/p38 MAPK pathways, consequently leading to a reduction of melanin levels.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30158241>Celastrol-Induced Weight Loss Is Driven by Hypophagia and Independent From UCP1.</a></h1><p>Celastrol, a plant-derived constituent of traditional Chinese medicine, has been proposed to offer significant potential as an antiobesity drug. However, the molecular mechanism for this activity is unknown. We show that the weight-lowering effects of celastrol are driven by decreased food consumption. Although young Lep  mice respond with a decrease in food intake and body weight, adult Lep  and Lep  mice are unresponsive to celastrol, suggesting that functional leptin signaling in adult mice is required to elicit celastrol's catabolic actions. Protein  phosphatase 1 (PTP1B), a leptin negative-feedback regulator, has been previously reported to be one of celastrol's targets. However, we found that global PTP1B knockout (KO) and wild-type (WT) mice have comparable weight loss and hypophagia when treated with celastrol. Increased levels of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) in subcutaneous white and brown adipose tissue suggest celastrol-induced thermogenesis as a further mechanism. However, diet-induced obese UCP1 WT and KO mice have comparable weight loss upon celastrol treatment, and celastrol treatment has no effect on energy expenditure under ambient housing or thermoneutral conditions. Overall, our results suggest that celastrol-induced weight loss is hypophagia driven and age-dependently mediated by functional leptin signaling. Our data encourage reconsideration of therapeutic antiobesity strategies built on leptin sensitization.© 2018 by the American Diabetes Association.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30052036>Human Mesenchymal Stem Cell Derived Exosomes Alleviate Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus by Reversing Peripheral Insulin Resistance and Relieving β-Cell Destruction.</a></h1><p>Exosomes are nanosized extracellular vesicles (EVs) that show great promise in tissue regeneration and injury repair as mesenchymal stem cell (MSC). MSC has been shown to alleviate diabetes mellitus (DM) in both animal models and clinical trials. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether exosomes from human umbilical cord MSC (hucMSC-ex) have a therapeutic effect on type 2 DM (T2DM). We established a rat model of T2DM using a high- diet and streptozotocin (STZ). We found that the intravenous injection of hucMSC-ex reduced blood glucose levels as a main paracrine approach of MSC. HucMSC-ex partially reversed insulin resistance in T2DM indirectly to accelerate glucose . HucMSC-ex restored the phosphorylation ( site) of the insulin receptor substrate 1 and protein kinase B in T2DM, promoted expression and membrane translocation of glucose transporter 4 in muscle, and increased storage of glycogen in the liver to maintain glucose homeostasis. HucMSC-ex inhibited STZ-induced β-cell apoptosis to restore the insulin-secreting function of T2DM. Taken together, exosomes from hucMSC can alleviate T2DM by reversing peripheral insulin resistance and relieving β-cell destruction, providing an alternative approach for T2DM treatment.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30117807>Ordered arrangement of dendrites within a  sensory nerve bundle.</a></h1><p>Biological systems are organized into well-ordered structures and can evolve new patterns when perturbed. To identify principles underlying biological order, we turned to  for its simple anatomy and powerful genetics. We developed a method to quantify the arrangement of three dendrites in the main sensory nerve bundle, and found that they exhibit a stereotyped arrangement throughout larval growth. Dendrite order does not require prominent features including sensory cilia and glial junctions. In contrast, loss of the cell adhesion molecule (CAM) CDH-4/-like cadherin causes dendrites to be ordered randomly, despite remaining bundled. Loss of the CAMs PTP-3/LAR or SAX-7/L1CAM causes dendrites to adopt an altered order, which becomes increasingly random as animals grow. Misexpression of SAX-7 leads to subtle but reproducible changes in dendrite order. Our results suggest that combinations of CAMs allow dendrites to self-organize into a stereotyped arrangement and can produce altered patterns when perturbed.© 2018, Yip et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30830386>Global testing of shifts in metabolic phenotype.</a></h1><p>Current metabolomics approaches to unravel impact of diet- or lifestyle induced phenotype variation and shifts predominantly deploy univariate or multivariate approaches, with a posteriori interpretation at pathway level. This however often provides only a fragmented view on the involved metabolic pathways.To demonstrate the feasibility of using Goeman's global test (GGT) for assessment of variation and shifts in metabolic phenotype at the level of a priori defined pathways.Two intervention studies with identified phenotype variations and shifts were examined. In a weight loss (WL) intervention study obese subjects received a mixed meal challenge before and after WL. In a polyphenol (PP) intervention study obese subjects received a high  mixed meal challenge (61E% ) before and after a PP intervention. Plasma samples were obtained at fasting and during the postprandial response. Besides WL- and PP-induced phenotype shifts, also correlation of plasma metabolome with phenotype descriptors was assessed at pathway level. The plasma metabolome covered organic acids, amino acids, biogenic amines, acylcarnitines and oxylipins.For the population of the WL study, GGT revealed that HOMA correlated with the fasting levels of the TCA cycle, BCAA catabolism, the lactate, arginine-proline and phenylalanine- pathways. For the population of the PP study, HOMA correlated with fasting metabolite levels of TCA cycle, fatty acid oxidation and phenylalanine- pathways. These correlations were more pronounced for metabolic pathways in the fasting state, than during the postprandial response. The effect of the WL and PP intervention on a priori defined metabolic pathways, and correlation of pathways with insulin sensitivity as described by HOMA was in line with previous studies.GGT confirmed earlier biological findings in a hypothesis led approach. A main advantage of GGT is that it provides a direct view on involvement of a priori defined pathways in phenotype shifts.ClinicalTrials.gov  .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30216961>The interplay between reactive oxygen and nitrogen species contributes in the regulatory mechanism of the nitro-oxidative stress induced by cadmium in Arabidopsis.</a></h1><p>Nitric oxide (NO) involved in various metabolic processes in plants. Although its significant influence has been established, the exact mechanisms of NO-derived products under metal-stress conditions are largely unknown. Here, we investigated the key components of reactive oxygen/nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) metabolisms under cadmium (Cd) stress using Arabidopsis as the model plant. Exposure to Cd disturbed redox homeostasis and increased  peroxidation, thus triggering oxidative stress. Complementarily, Cd caused differential changes in the selected amino acids: a promotion in partial amino acids might be a genotype-specific trait, while the phenylalanine ammonia-lyase activity increased in a dose-dependent manner in shoots. Furthermore, NO production as well as S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) reductase (GSNOR) activity were up-regulated by Cd with the simultaneous depletion of GSNO. Correspondingly, S-nitrosothiols were involved in generating peroxynitrite and  nitration of protein (NO-Tyr), in accordance with the regulation of NO-mediated post-translational modifications in antioxidant systems, including the ascorbate-glutathione cycle, amino acids and phenolic compounds, thereby provoking nitrosative stress. Our data provide comprehensive evidences regarding the clear relationships between the metabolisms of ROS and RNS, supporting the indicator role of NO-Tyr as a nitrosative stress in plants, and help to provide a better understanding of the ROS/RNS interaction under stress conditions.Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Leucocytes and platelets express multiple isoforms of the SFKs. Previous studies used broad-spectrum pharmacological inhibitors, or murine models deficient in multiple SFK isoforms, to demonstrate the functional consequences of deficiencies in SFK signalling. Here, we hypothesized that individual SFK operate in a non-redundant fashion in the thrombo-inflammatory recruitment of monocyte during atherosclerosis. Using in vitro adhesion assays and single SFK knockout mice crossed with the ApoE model of atherosclerosis, we find that SFK signalling regulates platelet-dependent recruitment of monocytes. However, loss of a single SFK, Fgr or Lyn, reduced platelet-mediated monocyte recruitment in vitro. This translated into a significant reduction in the burden of atherosclerotic disease in Fgr /ApoE or Lyn /ApoE animals. SFK signalling is not redundant in thrombo-inflammatory vascular disease and individual SFK may represent targets for therapeutic intervention.© 2018 The Authors.

Here we show that the expression of β3GalT5 significantly correlates with tumor progression and poor survival in patients, and the globo-series GSLs in breast cancer cells form a complex in membrane  raft with caveolin-1 (CAV1) and focal adhesion kinase (FAK) which then interact with AKT and receptor-interacting protein kinase (RIP), respectively. Knockdown of β3GalT5 disrupts the complex and induces apoptosis through dissociation of RIP from the complex to interact with the Fas death domain (FADD) and trigger the Fas-dependent pathway. This finding provides a link between SSEA3/SSEA4/Globo-H and the FAK/CAV1/AKT/RIP complex in tumor progression and apoptosis and suggests a direction for the treatment of breast cancer, as demonstrated by the combined use of antibodies against Globo-H and SSEA4.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30514903>Glycolipid iGb3 feedback amplifies innate immune responses via CD1d reverse signaling.</a></h1><p>The cross-talk between cellular  and the innate immune responses remains obscure. In addition to presenting  antigens to Natural Killer T-cells (NKT cells), the Cluster of Differentiation 1D Glycoprotein (CD1d) might mediate reverse signaling in antigen-presenting cells (APCs). Here we found CD1d deficiency attenuated Toll-like receptor (TLR)-triggered inflammatory innate responses in macrophages and dendritic cells, protecting mice from endotoxin shock. TLR activation in macrophages induced metabolic changes of glycosphingolipids (GSLs), among which glycolipid isoglobotrihexosylceramide (iGb3) was rapidly produced. The endogenously generated iGb3 bound CD1d in endosomal compartments and then synergized with the initially activated TLR signal to induce Tyr332 phosphorylation of CD1d intracellular domain. This led to the recruitment and activation of proline-rich  kinase 2 (Pyk2). Pyk2 interacted with IκB kinase β (IKKβ) and TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1), and enhanced  phosphorylation of Tyr188/199 of IKKβ and Tyr179 of TBK1 and thus, their activation to promote full activation of TLR signaling. Thus, intracellular CD1d reverse signaling, triggered by endogenous iGb3, amplifies inflammatory innate responses in APCs. Our findings identify a non-canonical function of CD1d reverse signaling activated by  metabolite in the innate immune response.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31429767>Dapagliflozin improves left ventricular remodeling and aorta sympathetic tone in a pig model of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction.</a></h1><p>Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is a difficult disease with high morbidity and mortality rates and lacks an effective treatment. Here, we report the therapeutic effect of dapagliflozin, a sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor (SGLT2i), on hypertension + hyperlipidemia-induced HFpEF in a pig model.HFpEF pigs were established by infusing a combination of deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA) and angiotensin II (Ang II), and Western diet (WD) feeding for 18 weeks. In the 9th week, half of the HFpEF pigs were randomly assigned to receive additional dapagliflozin treatment (10 mg/day) by oral gavage daily for the next 9 weeks. Blood pressure,  levels, echocardiography and cardiac hemodynamics for cardiac structural and functional changes, as well as epinephrine and norepinephrine concentrations in the plasma and tissues were measured. After sacrifice, cardiac fibrosis, the distribution of  hydroxylase (TH), inflammatory factors (IL-6 and TNF-α) and NO-cGMP-PKG pathway activity in the cardiovascular system were also determined.Blood pressure, total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) were markedly increased in HFpEF pigs, but only blood pressure was significantly decreased after 9 weeks of dapagliflozin treatment. By echocardiographic and hemodynamic assessment, dapagliflozin significantly attenuated heart concentric remodeling in HFpEF pigs, but failed to improve diastolic function and compliance with the left ventricle (LV). In the dapagliflozin treatment group, TH expression and norepinephrine concentration in the aorta were strongly mitigated compared to that in the HFpEF group. Moreover, inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and TNF-α in aortic tissue were markedly elevated in HFpEF pigs and inhibited by dapagliflozin. Furthermore, the reduced expression of eNOS and the PKG-1 protein and the cGMP content in the aortas of HFpEF pigs were significantly restored after 9 weeks of dapagliflozin treatment.9 weeks of dapagliflozin treatment decreases hypertension and reverses LV concentric remodeling in HFpEF pigs partly by restraining sympathetic tone in the aorta, leading to inhibition of the inflammatory response and NO-cGMP-PKG pathway activation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30108139>Prostaglandin F2α promotes embryo implantation and development in the pig.</a></h1><p>Successful establishment and development of pregnancy requires proper communication between developing conceptuses and the maternal reproductive tract. Prostaglandins are key players involved in the regulation of reproductive processes in mammals including pigs. Due to its luteolytic action, prostaglandin F2-alpha (PGF2α) is mainly considered as an undesirable factor during early pregnancy. However, its content in the uterine lumen is elevated in pigs and other mammals. Recently, we reported an important role of PGF2α in the endometrium during early pregnancy in the pig. Thus, the aim of the present study was to determine whether PGF2α can act on porcine trophoblast and if so, to elucidate what effect it could exert. We detected increased expression of PGF2α receptor during the implantation period (from day 14 until day 19 of pregnancy). Global gene expression profiling using microarrays and quantitative PCR studies revealed that PGF2α acting on porcine trophoblast cells in vitro alters expression of genes potentially involved in processes related to implantation, such as: cell proliferation, focal adhesion, extracellular matrix binding, cell migration, cytoskeleton organization, immune interactions, ion homeostasis, and . Using primary porcine trophoblast cells, we demonstrated that PGF2α stimulated trophoblast cell proliferation and adhesion to extracellular matrix protein. This was likely mediated by mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK1/3) and focal adhesion kinase (FAK) since we observed increased phosphorylation of MAPK1/3 and FAK in trophoblast cells treated with PGF2α. To conclude, the present report indicates a novel role for PGF2α in the porcine conceptus as a para- and autocrine factor supporting pregnancy establishment.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31301059>Effects of Potential Probiotic Strains on the Fecal Microbiota and Metabolites of D-Galactose-Induced Aging Rats Fed with High-Fat Diet.</a></h1><p>Both aging and diet play an important role in influencing the gut ecosystem. Using premature senescent rats induced by D-galactose and fed with high-fat diet, this study aims to investigate the effects of different potential probiotic strains on the dynamic changes of fecal microbiome and metabolites. In this study, male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed with high-fat diet and injected with D-galactose for 12 weeks to induce aging. The effect of Lactobacillus plantarum DR7, L. fermentum DR9, and L. reuteri 8513d administration on the fecal microbiota profile, short-chain fatty acids, and water-soluble compounds were analyzed. It was found that the administration of the selected strains altered the gut microbiota diversity and composition, even at the phylum level. The fecal short-chain fatty acid content was also higher in groups that were administered with the potential probiotic strains. Analysis of the fecal water-soluble metabolites revealed that administration of L. plantarum DR7 and L. reuteri 8513d led to higher fecal content of compounds related to amino acid  such as tryptophan, leucine, , cysteine, methionine, valine, and lysine; while administration of L. fermentum DR9 led to higher prevalence of compounds related to carbohydrate  such as erythritol, xylitol, and arabitol. In conclusion, it was observed that different strains of lactobacilli can cause difference alteration in the gut microbiota and the metabolites, suggesting the urgency to explore the specific  impact of specific strains on the host.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30466629>High-throughput metabolomics investigates anti-osteoporosis activity of oleanolic acid via regulating metabolic networks using ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry.</a></h1><p>Osteoporosis has brought about heavy socio-economic burden in the morbidity and medical expenses associated with osteoporosis treatment and various restrictions on behavior of their social roles. Oleanolic acid (OA) is an anti-osteoporosis natural product, but molecular mechanisms of therapeutic effect are not still well known.In this study, we explore anti-osteoporosis activity of oleanolic acid and predict the underlying mechanisms by metabolomics strategy.SD rats were intraperitoneal injection with prednison for once to establish osteoporosis model. Using metabolomics strategy based on ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight/ mass spectrometry (UPLC-TOF/MS), serum samples of 24 rats were analyzed to seek differential metabolites and pathway associated with OA treatment of osteoporosis. In addition, the effect of OA on osteoporosis rats was also evaluated by clinical biochemistry indicators and bone density analysis.Clinical biochemistry indicators and bone density of lumbar and femur were reversed by OA treatment. A total of 25 potential biomarkers were identified in the rats model of glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis, and oleanolic acid have a regulatory effect on 17 of them that related to some vital metabolic pathway such as linoleic acid , valine, leucine and isoleucine biosynthesis, phenylalanine,  and tryptophan biosynthesis as well as cysteine and methionine .

In our previous study, we demonstrated that 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA)-mediated sonodynamic therapy (SDT) could induce foam cells apoptosis via the mitochondrial-caspase pathway. In the current research, we sought to explore ALA-SDT-induced apoptosis of phagocytes and the effects of cholesterol efflux and efferocytosis in advanced apoE mice plaque.  apoE mice fed western diet were treated with ALA-SDT and sacrificed at day 1, day 3, day 7 and day 28 post treatment. THP-1 macrophage-derived foam cells were treated with ALA-SDT. 5 hours later, the supernatant was collected and added to fresh foam cells (phagocytes). Then, the  area, efferocytosis, cholesterol efflux, anti-inflammatory reactions and PPARγ-LXRα-ABCA1/ABCG1 pathway were detected in plaque  and in phagocytes .  We found that ALA-SDT induced foam cells apoptosis coupled with efferocytosis and upregulation of Mer  kinase (MerTK) both  and . The  content in plaque decreased as early as 1 day after ALA-SDT and this tendency persisted until 28 days. The enhancement of phagocytes cholesterol efflux was accompanied by an approximately 40% decrease in free cholesterol and a 24% decrease in total cholesterol . More importantly, anti-inflammatory factors such as TGFβ and IL-10 were upregulated by ALA-SDT treatment. Finally, we found that PPARγ-LXRα-ABCA1/ABCG1 pathway was activated both  and  by ALA-SDT, which could be blocked by PPARγ siRNA.  Activation of PPARγ-LXRα-ABCA1/ABCG1 pathway induced by ALA-SDT treatment engages a virtuous cycle that enhances efferocytosis, cholesterol efflux and anti-inflammatory reactions in advanced plaque  and in phagocytes .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30400369>Newly Identified Essential Amino Acids Affecting  DGAT1 Function Revealed by Site-Directed Mutagenesis.</a></h1><p>Diacylglycerol acyltransferase (DGAT) is a rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis of triacylglycerol (TAG), the most important form of energy storage in plants. Some residues have previously been proven to be crucial for DGAT1 activity. In this study, we used site-directed mutagenesis of the  gene from  to alter 16 amino acids to investigate effects on DGAT1 function. Of the 16 residues (L482R, E542R, Y553A, G577R, R579D, Y582R, R596D, H603D, H609D, A624R, F629R, S632A, W650R, A651R, Q658H, and P660R), we newly identified 5 (L482, R579, H603, A651, and P660) as being essential for DGAT1 function and 7 (E542, G577, R596, H609, A624, S632, and Q658) that significantly affect DGAT1 function to different degrees, as revealed by heterologous expression of the mutants in yeast strain INVSc1. Importantly, compared with , expression of the mutant  significantly increased the total fatty acid and TAG contents of INVSc1.

Given  metabolic reprogramming is widely known as a hallmark of cancer and intimately linked with EGFR-stimulated cancer growth. Activation of EGFR signal pathway increased monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) and  key enzyme Stearoyl-CoA Desaturase 1 (SCD1) expression. However the correlation between EGFR-TKI resistance and  remains to be determined.In this study the differences in  synthesis between paired TKI-sensitive and TKI-resistant patient tissues and NSCLC cell lines were explored. Oleic acid (OA, a kind of MUFA, the SCD1 enzymatic product) was used to simulate a high  metabolic environment and detected the affection on the cytotoxic effect of TKIs (Gefitinib and osimertinib) in cell lines with EGFR-activating mutations. (20S)-Protopanaxatriol (g-PPT), an aglycone of ginsenosides, has been reported to be an effective  inhibitor, was used to inhibit . Additionally, synergism in cytotoxic effects and signal pathway activation were evaluated using CCK-8 assays, Western blotting, flow cytometry, Edu assays, plate clone formation assays and immunofluorescence. Furthermore, two xenograft mouse models were used to verify the in vitro results.Gefitinib-resistant cells have higher  droplet content and SCD1 expression than Gefitinib-sensitive cells in both NSCLC cell lines and patient tissues. Additionally oleic acid (OA, a kind of MUFA, the SCD1 enzymatic product) abrogates the cytotoxic effect of both Gefitinib and osimertinib in cell lines with EGFR-activating mutations. As a reported effective  inhibitor, g-PPT significantly inhibited the expression of SCD1 in lung adenocarcinoma cells, and then down-regulated the content of intracellular  droplets. Combined treatment with Gefitinib and g-PPT reverses the resistance to Gefitinib and inhibits the activation of p-EGFR and the downstream signaling pathways.Our findings uncover a link between  metabolic reprogramming and EGFR-TKI resistance, confirmed that combination target both EGFR and abnormal  maybe a promising therapy for EGFR-TKI resistance and highlighting the possibility of monitoring  accumulation in tumors for predicting drug resistance.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31004588>Do Third Molars Contribute to Systemic Inflammation? Results From a Population-Based Study From Northeast Germany.</a></h1><p>Erupted and impacted third molars have been reported to contribute to systemic inflammation. This study investigated the systemic effect of third molars on serum levels of inflammatory parameters and on inflammatory messenger peptide hormones in a general population sample.Data of 2,151 participants from the Study of Health in Pomerania were included in this study. Erupted or impacted third molars were assessed with whole-body magnetic resonance imaging at 1.5 T and associated with biomarkers of inflammation, , glucose , and peptide hormones by linear regression. Models were adjusted for age, gender, smoking status, education, and type 2 diabetes mellitus.Neither erupted nor impacted third molars were associated with high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, white blood cell count, or fibrinogen as markers for systemic inflammation. Participants with erupted third molars had markedly lower serum levels of leptin (β coefficient, -2.47; 95% confidence interval [CI], -4.47 to -0.48), angiopoietin-2 (β coefficient, -135.1; 95% CI, 248.6 to -21.5), and ratio of angiopoietin-2 to  kinase with immunoglobulin-like loop epidermal growth factor homology domain 2 (β coefficient, -6.57; 95% CI, -13.06 to -00.7) than participants without third molars. No such associations were observed for impacted third molars.The present results did not substantiate a relation between third molars and an increase in systemic inflammatory markers. Therefore, dental practitioners should be careful when considering this as the only indication for removal of third molars, especially in medically compromised patients. The results of this study showed that participants with erupted third molars had lower levels of messenger peptide hormones, such as leptin and angiopoetin-2.Copyright © 2019 American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons.

Indeed, it is unknown whether the mechanism of IR in PCOS is mediated through changes in the metabolome.  Twelve women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and ten age and body mass index matched controls completed an 8 week supervised exercise program at 60% maximal oxygen consumption. Before and after the exercise program, all participants underwent maximal IR stimulation with intralipid infusions followed by insulin sensitivity (IS) measurement by hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic clamps. Amino acid profiles and metabolites were taken at baseline and at maximal insulin resistance stimulation before and after the exercise program.  At baseline, PCOS subjects showed increased leucine/isoleucine, glutamate, methionine, ornithine, phenylalanine,  and proline ( < 0.05) that, following exercise, did not differ from controls. While compering within the groups, no significant changes in the amino acid levels before and after exercise were observed. Exercise improved VO2 max ( < 0.01) but did not alter weight. Amino acid profiles were unaffected by an acute increase in IR induced by the  infusion. IS was lower in PCOS ( < 0.001) and was further decreased by the  infusion in both PCOS and controls. Although, exercise improved IS in both PCOS and in controls, the IS remained compromised in PCOS.  The baseline amino acid profile in PCOS reflected that seen in obese subjects and differed to controls. After exercise, and despite no change in weight in either group, there were no differences in the amino acid profile between PCOS and controls. This shows that exercise may normalize the amino acid metabolome, irrespective of weight. : ISRCTN42448814.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31071507>An integrative investigation on the efficacy of Plantaginis semen based on UPLC-QTOF-MS metabolomics approach in hyperlipidemic mice.</a></h1><p>Plantaginis semen, the dried mature seed of Plantago asiatica L. or Plantago deprdssa Willd., has a prominent effect on the treatment of obesity, type 2 diabetes and  disorders, however, its clinical application is limited due to inadequate in-depth mechanism exploration and incomplete discussion of action targets of its in vivo. Therefore, an untargeted metabolomics approach was firstly applied to study the serum metabolic differences in mice. Metabolomics analysis was performed using ultra performance liquid chromatography quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-QTOF-MS) together with multivariate statistical data analysis. The results showed that Plantaginis semen can mainly improve blood lipids, some degree in blood glucose and insulin levels in high- mice, in addition, the phenotype of liver and  stained sections demonstrated remarkable results. A total of 22 metabolites involved in arachidonic acid, glycerophospholipid, glycosphingolipid, linoleate, Omega-3 fatty acid, phosphatidylinositol phosphate and  metabolisms were identified. In further, it was found that the possible mechanisms of Plantaginis semen on hyperlipidemic mice lied in the biosynthesis of thyroxine, biological effects of enzymes of phospholipase A2 activity, glucosylceramide synthase and inositol essential enzyme 1α, genes expressions of fatty acid  and inflammation. Serum metabolomics revealed that Plantaginis semen could cure the organism disease via regulating multiple metabolic pathways which will be helpful for understanding the mechanism of this herb and providing references for better applications of it in clinic, even researches on other TCMs.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

In our previous papers, we found that CytC and CL mixed in millimolar concentrations form a sediment showing microcrystals composed of nanospheres (Cyt-CL) of 11-12 and 8 nm in diameter. The hypothesis was proposed that Cyt-CL, having hydrophobic shell, may appear inside the membrane  bilayer in mitochondria and peroxidase membrane phospholipids so initiating the apoptotic cascade. In this work, Cyt-CL complex dissolved in chloroform or hexane was investigated as a model of the complex in mitochondrial membranes. We used dynamic light scattering method to measure the size of the particles. The analysis of particles size distribution of Cyt-CL in chloroform allows to reveal three dominant diameters of 12.1 ± 1.4, 7.8 ± 1.0, and 4.7 ± 0.7 nm. The first two values are closed to those, earlier obtained with small-angle X-ray scattering method in Cyt-CL microcrystals, 11.1 ± 1.0 and 8.0 ± 0.7 nm. CL extracted in chloroform-methanol forms a real solution of particles with diameter of 0.7 ± 0.1 nm. In methanol-water phase, CL and CL + CytC mixture form particles of 83.7 ± 9.8 and 71.3 ± 11.6 nm, respectively. Apparently, cardiolipin in 50% methanol forms single-layer liposomes regardless of the presence of CytC in the medium. Partial unfolding of CytC in the complex was evidenced by (a) appearance of fluorescence of  and tryptophan residues and (b) disappearance of the absorption band at 699 nm due to breakdown of heme iron - methionine bond > F⋯S(Met80). In hydrophobic solvent Cyt-CL exhibited quasi-lipoperoxidase and lipoxygenase activity as was shown in kinetic measurements of chemiluminescence enhanced by coumarin C-525, a selective sensitizer of chemiluminescence, associated with reactions of  peroxyl radicals. Our data in this model system do not contradict the hypothesis (Vladimirov, Y.A. et al.

With both receptor and ligand constrained to move within the membranes of their respective cells, this signaling system inevitably experiences spatial confinement and mechanical forces in conjunction with receptor-ligand binding. In this study, we reconstitute the EphB4-ephrin-B2 juxtacrine signaling geometry using a supported--bilayer system presenting laterally mobile and monomeric ephrin-B2 ligands to live neural stem cells. This experimental platform successfully reconstitutes EphB4-ephrin-B2 binding, lateral clustering, downstream signaling activation, and neuronal differentiation, all in a configuration that preserves the spatiomechanical aspects of the natural juxtacrine signaling geometry. Additionally, the supported bilayer system allows control of lateral movement and clustering of the receptor-ligand complexes through patterns of physical barriers to lateral diffusion fabricated onto the underlying substrate. The results from this study reveal a distinct spatiomechanical effect on the ability of EphB4-ephrin-B2 signaling to induce neuronal differentiation. These observations parallel similar studies of the EphA2-ephrin-A1 system in a very different biological context, suggesting that such spatiomechanical regulation may be a common feature of Eph-ephrin signaling.Copyright © 2018 Biophysical Society.

RAD51 recombinase (RAD51) is a critical component of HR and facilitates DNA strand exchange in DSB repair. We report here that treating triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells with the fatty acid nitroalkene 10-nitro-octadec-9-enoic acid (OA-NO) in combination with the antineoplastic DNA-damaging agents doxorubicin, cisplatin, olaparib, and γ-irradiation (IR) enhances the antiproliferative effects of these agents. OA-NO inhibited IR-induced RAD51 foci formation and enhanced H2A histone family member X (H2AX) phosphorylation in TNBC cells. Analyses of fluorescent DSB reporter activity with both static-flow cytometry and kinetic live-cell studies enabling temporal resolution of recombination revealed that OA-NO inhibits HR and not nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ). OA-NO alkylated Cys-319 in RAD51, and this alkylation depended on the Michael acceptor properties of OA-NO because nonnitrated and saturated nonelectrophilic analogs of OA-NO, octadecanoic acid and 10-nitro-octadecanoic acid, did not react with Cys-319. Of note, OA-NO alkylation of RAD51 inhibited its binding to ssDNA. RAD51 Cys-319 resides within the SH3-binding site of ABL proto-oncogene 1, nonreceptor  kinase (ABL1), so we investigated the effect of OA-NO-mediated Cys-319 alkylation on ABL1 binding and found that OA-NO inhibits RAD51-ABL1 complex formation both  and in cell-based immunoprecipitation assays. The inhibition of the RAD51-ABL1 complex also suppressed downstream RAD51 Tyr-315 phosphorylation. In conclusion, RAD51 Cys-319 is a functionally significant site for adduction of soft electrophiles such as OA-NO and suggests further investigation of  electrophile-based combinational therapies for TNBC.© 2019 Asan et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30347867> Polysaccharide Improves Insulin Sensitivity via AMPK Activation in 3T3-L1 Adipocytes.</a></h1><p> polysaccharide (APS) is an important bioactive component of  which is used as an anti-diabetes herb in traditional Chinese medicine. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects and mechanisms of APS on insulin-sensitizing of adipocytes. Mouse 3T3-L1 preadipocytes were used as a model. The results showed that APS increased preadipocytes proliferation in a dose dependent manner, and 0.1 μg/mL APS sufficiently increased Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen (PCNA) content ( < 0.01). Moreover, APS enhanced intracellular  accumulation and mRNA expression of proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ,  < 0.01), CCAAT/enhancer binding protein α (C/EBPα,  < 0.01) and fatty acid binding protein (P2,  < 0.01). As expected, corresponding protein contents were elevated. Importantly, APS increased 2-(-(7-Nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl)Amino)-2-Deoxyglucose (2-NBDG) uptake ( < 0.01). Meanwhile, both mRNA and protein content of glucose transporter 4 (Glut4) were elevated by APS ( < 0.01). The APS treatment enhanced  phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1,  < 0.05) and phosphor-Akt content ( < 0.01). Besides, phosphorylated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) content was increased in the APS treated cells ( < 0.01). Taken together, APS improved insulin sensitivity by enhancing glucose uptake, possibly through AMPK activation.

However, little is known about molecular mechanisms underlying this spatial sensitivity, in part due to lack of experimental systems. Here, we introduce a hybrid live-cell patterned supported  bilayer experimental platform in which the sites of EphA2 activation and integrin adhesion are spatially controlled. Using a series of live-cell imaging and single-molecule tracking experiments, we map the transmission of signals from ephrinA1:EphA2 complexes. Results show that ligand-dependent EphA2 activation induces localized myosin-dependent contractions while simultaneously increasing focal adhesion dynamics throughout the cell. Mechanistically, Src kinase is activated at sites of ephrinA1:EphA2 clustering and subsequently diffuses on the membrane to focal adhesions, where it up-regulates FAK and paxillin  phosphorylation. EphrinA1:EphA2 signaling triggers multiple cellular responses with differing spatial dependencies to enable a directed migratory response to spatially resolved contact with ephrinA1 ligands.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30015970>Caveolin‑1 enhances RANKL‑induced gastric cancer cell migration.</a></h1><p>The classical pathway involving receptor activator of nuclear factor‑κB (RANK) and its ligand (RANKL) induces the activation of osteoclasts and the migration of a variety of tumor cells, including breast and lung cancer. In our previous study, the expression of RANK was identified on the surface of gastric cancer cells, however, whether the RANKL/RANK pathway is involved in the regulation of gastric cancer cell migration remains to be fully elucidated.  rafts represent a major platform for the regulation of cancer signaling; however, their involvement in RANKL‑induced migration remains to be elucidated. To investigate the potential roles and mechanism of RANKL/RANK in gastric cancer migration and metastasis, the present study examined the expression of RANK by western blot analysis and the expression of caveolin‑1 (Cav‑1) in gastric cancer tissues by immunohistochemistry, in addition to cell migration which is measured by Transwell migration assay. The aggregation of  reft was observed by fluorescence microscopy and western blotting was used to measure signaling changes in associated pathways. The results showed that RANKL induced gastric cancer cell migration, accompanied by the activation of Cav‑1 and aggregation of  rafts. Nystatin, a  raft inhibitor, inhibited the activation of Cav‑1 and markedly reversed RANKL‑induced gastric cancer cell migration. The RANKL‑induced activation of Cav‑1 has been shown to occur with the activation of proto‑oncogene ‑protein kinase Src (c‑Src). The c‑Src inhibitor, PP2, inhibited the activation of Cav‑1 and  raft aggregation, and reversed RANKL‑induced gastric cancer cell migration. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that Cav‑1 was involved in RANKL‑induced cell migration in lung, renal and breast cancer cells. These results suggested that RANKL induced gastric cancer cell migration, likely through mechanisms involving the c‑Src/Cav‑1 pathway and  raft aggregation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30367392>Variations in adrenal gland medulla and dopamine effects induced by the lack of Irs2.</a></h1><p>The adrenomedullary chromaffin cells' hormonal pathway has been related to the pathophysiology of diabetes mellitus. In mice, the deletion of insulin receptor substrate type 2 (Irs2) causes peripheral insulin resistance and reduction in β-cell mass, leading to overt diabetes, with gender differences on adrenergic signaling. To further unravel the relevance of Irs2 on glycemic control, we analyzed in adult Irs2 deficient (Irs2) mice, of both sexes but still normoglycemic, dopamine effects on insulin secretion and glycerol release, as well as their adrenal medulla by an immunohistochemical and morphologic approach. In isolated islets, 10 μM dopamine significantly inhibited insulin release in wild-type (WT) and female Irs2 mice; however, male Irs2 islets were insensitive to that catecholamine. Similarly, on isolated adipocytes, gender differences were observed between WT and Irs2 mice in basal and evoked glycerol release with crescent concentrations of dopamine. By immunohistochemistry, reactivity to  hydroxylase (TH) in female mice was significantly higher in the adrenal medulla of Irs2 compared to WT; although no differences for TH-immunopositivity were observed between the male groups of mice. However, compared to their corresponding WT animals, adrenomedullary chromaffin cells of Irs2 mice showed a significant decrease in the cellular and nuclear areas, and even in their percentage of apoptosis. Therefore, our observations suggest that, together with gender differences on dopamine responses in Irs2 mice, disturbances in adrenomedullary chromaffin cells could be related to deficiency of Irs2. Accordingly, Irs2 could be necessary for adequate glucose homeostasis and maintenance of the population of the adrenomedullary chromaffin cells.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29887500>Interactions of the EphA2 Kinase Domain with PIPs in Membranes: Implications for Receptor Function.</a></h1><p>EphA2 is a member of the receptor  kinase family. Interactions of the cytoplasmic region of EphA2 with the cell membrane are functionally important and yet remain incompletely characterized. Molecular dynamics simulations combined with biochemical studies reveal the interactions of the transmembrane, juxtamembrane (JM), and kinase domains with the membrane. We describe how the kinase domain is oriented relative to the membrane and how the JM region can modulate this interaction. We highlight the role of phosphatidylinositol phosphates (PIPs) in mediating the interaction of the kinase domain with the membrane and, conversely, how positively charged patches at the kinase surface and in the JM region induce the formation of nanoclusters of PIP molecules in the membrane. Integration of these results with those from previous studies enable computational reconstitution of a near complete EphA2 receptor within a membrane, suggesting a role for receptor- interactions in modulation of EphA2.Copyright © 2018 The Authors.

In this work, glucosylceramide synthase (GCS) was targeted, using RNA interference technology (siRNAs), in U87 and DBTRG human glioblastoma (GBM) cells, as in both cell types GCS showed to be overexpressed with respect to normal human astrocytes. The efficacy of a combined therapy to tackle GBM, allying GCS silencing to the new generation chemotherapeutics sunitinib and axitinib, or to the alkylating drugs etoposide and temozolomide, is evaluated here for the first time. With this purpose, studies addressing GBM cell viability and proliferation, cell cycle and apoptosis were performed, which revealed that combination of GCS silencing with axitinib treatment represents a promising therapeutic approach. The reduction of cell viability induced by this combined therapy is proposed to be mediated by excessive production of reactive oxygen species. This work, identifying GCS as a key molecular target to increase GBM susceptibility to a new generation chemotherapeutic, opens windows to the development of innovative strategies to halt GBM recurrence after surgical resection.© The Author(s) 2019.

In this study, a urinary metabolomic method based on gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) coupled with pattern recognition analysis was performed in three groups (control, model, and QHD group), to explore the effect of QHD on fatty liver and its mechanism of action. There was obvious separation between the model group and control group, and the QHD group showed a tendency of recovering to the control group in metabolic profiles. Twelve candidate biomarkers were identified and used to explore the possible mechanism. Then, a pathway analysis was performed using MetaboAnalyst 3.0 to illustrate the pathways of therapeutic action of QHD.

Recent studies indicate a potential role for NR4A1 in mast cells, yet its role in allergic responses remains largely unknown.The aim of this study was to clarify the role of NR4A1 in mast cell activation and anaphylaxis.To evaluate the function of NR4A1 in mast cells, the impacts of siRNA knockdown, gene knockout, adenoviral overexpression, and pharmacological inhibition of NR4A1 on FcεRI signaling and effector functions in mouse bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMCs) in vitro and on anaphylactic responses in vivo were evaluated.Knockdown or knockout of NR4A1 markedly suppressed degranulation and  mediator production by FcεRI-crosslinked BMMCs, while its overexpression augmented these responses. Treatment with a NR4A1 antagonist also blocked mast cell activation to a similar extent as NR4A1 knockdown or knockout. Moreover, mast cell-specific NR4A1-deficient mice displayed dampened anaphylactic responses in vivo. Mechanistically, NR4A1 promoted FcεRI signaling by counteracting the liver kinase B1 (LKB1)/adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) axis. Following FcεRI crosslinking, NR4A1 bound to the LKB1/AMPK complex and sequestered it in the nucleus, thereby promoting FcεRI downstream signaling pathways. Silencing or knockout of LKB1/AMPK largely abrogated the effect of NR4A1 on mast cell activation. Additionally, NR4A1 facilitated spleen  kinase activation independently of LKB1/AMPK.Nuclear receptor subfamily 4 group A member 1 positively regulates mast cell activation by antagonizing the LKB1-AMPK-dependent negative regulatory axis.

Our finding represents clues as to the dynamic ACP recognition and catalysis mechanism of dehydratase in fatty acid biosynthesis, and provides critical information for developing antimicrobials targeting the dehydratase module in fatty acid biosynthesis pathway.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

However, the  regulatory role of adenine nucleotides in type 2 diabetes remains unclear.Adenine nucleotides and their metabolites in plasma and liver were examined by HPLC. H NMR-based metabolomics analysis was performed to explore the changes of metabolites in mouse models of type 2 diabetes. Na/K ATPase and Na/H exchanger activity were measured in response to adenine nucleotide metabolites. Human recombinant protein  phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) was used for enzyme kinetic assays. Protein binding assays were performed with microscale thermophoresis. The intracellular pH of hepatocyte AML12 cell lines was measured using the BCECF-AM method. We also analysed pAMP levels in participants with type 2 diabetes.Elevation of pAMP was a universal phenomenon in all mouse models of type 2 diabetes including db/db vs lean mice (13.9 ± 2.3 μmol/l vs 3.7 ± 0.9 μmol/l; p < 0.01), ob/ob vs lean mice (9.1 ± 2.0 μmol/l vs 3.9 ± 1.2 μmol/l; p < 0.01) and high-fat diet/streptozotocin-induced vs wild-type mice (6.6 ± 1.5 μmol/l vs 4.1 ± 0.9 μmol/l; p < 0.05); this elevation was required for the occurrence of hyperglycaemia in obese mice. H NMR-based metabolomics study following HPLC analysis revealed that the metabolite profile in wild-type mice treated with 5'-AMP was similar to that in db/db diabetic mice, especially the accumulation of a large quantity of ATP and its metabolites. The glucose-lowering drug metformin reduced the severity of hyperglycaemia both in 5'-AMP-induced wild-type mice and db/db mice. Metformin decreased the accumulation of liver ATP but not its metabolites in these hyperglycaemic mice. ATP and metformin reciprocally change cellular pH homeostasis in liver, causing opposite shifts in liver activity of PTP1B, a key negative regulator of insulin signalling. Furthermore, pAMP levels were also elevated in individuals with type 2 diabetes (45.2 ± 22.7 nmol/l vs 3.1 ± 1.9 nmol/l; p < 0.01).These results reveal an emerging role for adenine nucleotide in the regulation of hyperglycaemia and provide a potential therapeutic target in obesity and type 2 diabetes.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30202641>Identification of candidate genes and proteins in aging skeletal muscle (sarcopenia) using gene expression and structural analysis.</a></h1><p>Sarcopenia is an age-related disease characterized by the loss of muscle mass and muscle function. A proper understanding of its pathogenesis and mechanisms may lead to new strategies for diagnosis and treatment of the disease. This study aims to discover the underlying genes, proteins, and pathways associated with sarcopenia in both genders. Integrated analysis of microarray datasets has been performed to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between old and young skeletal muscles. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis were then performed to uncover the functions of the DEGs. Moreover, a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed based on the DEGs. We have identified 41,715 DEGs, including 19 downregulated and 41,696 upregulated ones, in men. Among women, 3,015 DEGs have been found, with 2,874 of them being upregulated and 141 downregulated genes. Among the top up-regulated and downregulated genes, the ribosome biogenesis genes and genes involved in  storage may be closely related to aging muscles in men and women respectively. Also, the DEGs were enriched in the pathways including those of ribosome and Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) in men and women, respectively. In the PPI network, Neurotrophic Receptor  Kinase 1 (NTRK1), Cullin 3 (CUL3) and P53 have been identified as significant hub proteins in both genders. Using the integrated analysis of multiple gene expression profiles, we propose that the ribosome biogenesis genes and those involved in  storage would be promising markers for sarcopenia in men and women, respectively. In the reconstructed PPI network, neurotrophic factors expressed in skeletal muscle are essential for motoneuron survival and muscle fiber innervation during development. Cullin E3 ubiquitin ligase (Cul3) is an important component of the ubiquitin-proteasome system-it regulates the proteolysis. P53 is recognized as a central regulator of the cell cycle and apoptosis. These proteins, which have been identified as the most significant hubs, may be involved in aging muscle and sarcopenia.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31301539>Boswellic extracts and 11-keto-ß-boswellic acids prevent type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus by suppressing the expression of proinflammatory cytokines.</a></h1><p>Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease directed to the pancreatic islets where inflammation leads to the death of insulin-producing ß cells and insulin deficiency. Type 2 diabetes, which is closely related to overweight, is characterized by insulin resistance. In both cases, proinflammatory cytokines play an important role by causing insulitis and insulin resistance. The gum resin of Boswellia species and its pharmacologically active compounds, including 11-keto-ß-boswellic acids have been shown to suppress the expression of proinflammatory cytokines in various immune-competent cells.To review the present evidence of the therapeutic effects of boswellic extracts (BE) and/or 11-keto-ß-boswellic acids in the prevention/treatment of diabetes mellitus and to provide comprehensive insights into the underlying molecular mechanisms.This review considers all available informations from preclinical and clinical studies concerning BEs, 11-keto-ß-boswellic acids, proinflammatory cytokines and diabetes mellitus collected via electronic search (PubMed) and related publications of the author.Type 1 diabetes: Studies in mice with autoimmune diabetes revealed that in the model of multiple injections of low doses of streptozotocin (MLD-STZ), an extract of the gum resin of Boswellia serrata and 11-keto-ß-boswellic acid (KBA) suppressed the increase in proinflammatory cytokines in the blood, infiltration of lymphocytes into pancreatic islets and increase in blood glucose. In a second model, i.e. the nonobese diabetic (NOD) mouse, KBA prevented the infiltration of lymphocytes into pancreatic islets. Regarding the clinical effects, a case report provided evidence that BE suppressed the blood levels of  phosphatase antibody (IA-A), a marker for insulitis, in a patient with late-onset autoimmune diabetes of the adult (LADA). Type 2 diabetes: In a preclinical study in rats where obesity was alimentary induced, the administration of BE significantly reduced food intake, overweight, proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1ß (IL-1ß), and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and ameliorated the parameters of glucose and lipid . Similar results were obtained in a second animal study, where type 2 diabetes was induced by a combination of a high-fat/high-fructose diet and a single dose of streptozotocin. Two clinical trials with patients with type 2 diabetes receiving the resin of Boswellia serrata demonstrated improvement in the blood glucose, HbA and lipid parameters.Preclinical and clinical data suggest that BE and/or 11-keto-ß-boswellic acids by inhibiting the expression of proinflammatory cytokines from immune-competent cells, may prevent insulitis and insulin resistance in type 1 and type 2 diabetes, respectively, and therefore may be an option in the treatment/prevention of type 1 and type 2 diabetes. It is hypothesized that molecularly, BE and 11-keto-ß-boswellic acids act via interference with the IκB kinase/Nuclear Transcription Factor-κB (IKK/NF-κB) signaling pathway through inhibition of the phosphorylation activity of IKK. However, further investigations and well-designed clinical studies are required.Copyright © 2019 The Author. Published by Elsevier GmbH..

Feather and skin are ideal tissues to explore the genomics and complexity of color patterns in vertebrates. Two species of the genus Chrysolophus, golden pheasant (Chrysolophus pictus) and Lady Amherst's pheasant (Chrysolophus amherstiae), exhibit brilliant colors in their plumage, but with extreme phenotypic differences, making these two species great models to investigate plumage coloration mechanisms in birds.We sequenced and assembled a genome of golden pheasant with high coverage and annotated 15,552 protein-coding genes. The genome of Lady Amherst's pheasant is sequenced with low coverage. Based on the feather pigment identification, a series of genomic and transcriptomic comparisons were conducted to investigate the complex features of plumage coloration. By identifying the lineage-specific sequence variations in Chrysolophus and golden pheasant against different backgrounds, we found that four melanogenesis biosynthesis genes and some -related genes might be candidate genomic factors for the evolution of melanin and carotenoid pigmentation, respectively. In addition, a study among 47 birds showed some candidate genes related to carotenoid coloration in a broad range of birds. The transcriptome data further reveal important regulators of the two colorations, particularly one splicing transcript of the microphthalmia-associated transcription factor gene for pheomelanin synthesis.Analysis of the golden pheasant and its sister pheasant genomes, as well as comparison with other avian genomes, are helpful to reveal the underlying regulation of their plumage coloration. The present study provides important genomic information and insights for further studies of avian plumage evolution and diversity.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30213558>Dietary oleic acid-induced CD36 promotes cervical cancer cell growth and metastasis via up-regulation Src/ERK pathway.</a></h1><p>Epidemiological and experimental studies have revealed strong associations between dietary lipids and cancer risk. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of dietary fatty acids on the genesis and progression of cancer have been poorly explored. In this study, we found that a high olive oil diet stimulated cervical cancer (CC) carcinogenesis, and oleic acid (OA), the main  in olive oil, was associated with increased malignancy in HeLa cells. OA up-regulated the expression of CD36, which is the best characterized fatty acid transporter. Inhibiting CD36 prevented the tumor-promoting effects of OA, while overexpressing CD36 mimicked the effects of OA. Clinically, CD36 expression was positively correlated with tumor progression and poor prognosis in patients with CC. Furthermore, OA induced Src kinase and downstream ERK1/2 pathway activation in a CD36-dependent manner. Pretreatment of HeLa cells with an Src kinase inhibitor largely blocked the tumor-promoting effect of OA. Our findings suggest that dietary OA exerts a stimulatory effect on CC growth and metastasis, and CD36 might be a promising therapeutic target that acts against CC through an Src/ERK-dependent signaling pathway.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor is a receptor  kinase, which may mediate signalling to promote progression and invasion of various cancers. In this study, we uncovered the molecular mechanisms underlying the interconnection among the androgen receptor (AR), matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP9) and EGFR in promoting PCa progression.Immunohistochemical analysis of the tissue microarrays consisting of primary and metastatic PCa tissues was performed. The clinical importance of EGFR and its association with survivals were analyzed using three cohorts from MSKCC Prostate Oncogenome Project dataset (For primary tumors, n = 181; for metastatic tumors n = 37) and The Cancer Genome Atlas Prostate Adenocarcinoma Provisional dataset (n = 495). Targeted overexpression or inhibition of the proteins of interests was introduced into PCa cell lines. Treatment of PCa cell lines with the compounds was conducted. Immunoblot analysis was performed.We showed that AR, MMP-9 and EGFR are interconnect factors, which may cooperatively promote PCa progression. Altered EGFR expression was associated with poor disease-free survival in PCa patients. Induced overexpression of AR led to an increase in the expression of EGFR, p-GSK-3β and decrease in p27 expression in PCa cell lines in the presence of androgen stimulation. Overexpression of MMP9 significantly induced EGFR expression in PCa cells. Inhibition of PIP5K1α, a  kinase that acts upstream of PI3K/AKT greatly reduced expressions of AR, MMP-9 and EGFR.Our findings also suggest that PCa cells may utilize AR, EGFR and MMP-9 pathways in androgen-dependent as well as in castration-resistant conditions. Our data suggest a new therapeutic potential to block cancer metastasis by targeting AR, EGFR and MMP-9 pathways in subsets of PCa patients.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30201376>Selective peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α modulator K-877 regulates the expression of ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 in pancreatic beta cells.</a></h1><p>ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) protein is a pivotal regulator of cholesterol and phospholipid efflux from cells to high-density lipoprotein (HDL) particles. Pancreatic ABCA1 functions in beta cell cholesterol homeostasis and affects insulin secretion. We investigated the effect of pemafibrate (K-877), a novel selective PPARα modulator (SPPARMα), on pancreatic ABCA1 expression. In vivo experiment, mice were divided into four treatment groups, namely, normal food plus placebo, high  diet (HFD) plus placebo, normal food plus K-877 (0.3 mg/kg/day), or HFD plus K-877 (0.3 mg/kg/day), and treated for eight weeks. The results in vitro experiment indicate that K-877 treatment increased levels of ABCA1 mRNA, as well as protein, subsequently reduced the cellular cholesterol content in INS-1 cells. PPARα specific antagonist GW6471 attenuate K-877 induced ABCA1 expression in INS-1 cells. ABCA1 promoter activity increased with K-877 treatment at concentration 1 μM and 10 μM. Glucose-stimulated insulin secretion was ameliorated by K-877 treatment in INS-1 cells and isolated mouse islets. Although the expression of ABCA1 was reduced in mice with HFD treatment, both ABCA1 protein and mRNA levels were increased in mice with K-877 treatment. K-877 treatment improved glucose intolerance induced by HFD in mice. These findings raise the possibility that K-877 may affect insulin secretion by controlling ABCA1 expression in pancreatic beta cells.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Egg yolk freezing extenders are composed by two fractions: insoluble granules and soluble plasma, which contains the low density lipoproteins (LDL) proposed as responsible for the egg yolk cryoprotective action. The aim of this work was to analyze the effects of complete egg yolk and its insoluble, soluble and LDL fractions on boar sperm quality and protein  phosphorylation after the first stage of a standard cryopreservation protocol. Semen samples in Androstar Plus diluent were centrifuged and resuspended in the different egg yolk extenders. Temperature was decreased from 17 °C to 5 °C and sperm quality, protein  phosphorylation and protein pattern were analyzed. Results showed that complete egg yolk as well as soluble and LDL egg yolk fractions maintained sperm quality after temperature decrease. Cooling without any  component or in the presence of the insoluble fraction, significantly reduced sperm motility. About sperm protein  phosphorylation analysis, the p32 band appeared before treatments or after cooling in Androstar Plus diluent. Complete egg yolk and its insoluble fraction interfered with sperm  phosphorylation even after cells were extensively washed. Analysis of extenders revealed a high amount of  phosphorylated proteins in the insoluble fraction, which may have co-precipitate with sperm in experiments. Samples submitted to temperature decrease from 17 °C to 5 °C in the presence of soluble and LDL egg yolk fractions in Androstar Plus diluent did not show any change in the p32 band associated with sperm capacitation. However, a -phosphorylated protein of 33 kD present in clarified egg yolk was also observed in sperm treated with this extender. Protein transference from plasma and LDL egg yolk extenders was also observed in sperm protein profile. Results suggested that soluble and LDL fractions might have a protective action preventing sperm protein  phosphorylation during cooling from 17 °C to 5 °C. Further studies are needed to expand the knowledge of the LDL protection mechanism as well as to determine the possible benefits of clarified egg yolk in freezing protocols.Copyright © 2019.

In this study, we report DBC1 (deleted in breast cancer 1; also known as CCAR2) as a novel STAT5A-interacting protein. DBC1 has been primarily studied in tumor cells, but there is evidence that loss of this protein may promote metabolic health in mice. Currently, the functions of DBC1 in mature adipocytes are largely unknown. Using immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting techniques, we confirmed that there is an association between endogenous STAT5A and DBC1 proteins under physiological conditions in the adipocyte nucleus that is not dependent upon STAT5A  phosphorylation. We used siRNA to knockdown DBC1 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes to determine the impact on STAT5A activity, adipocyte gene expression, and TNFα (tumor necrosis factor α)-regulated lipolysis. The loss of DBC1 did not affect the expression of several STAT5A target genes including , , , , and  However, we did observe decreased levels of TNFα-induced glycerol and free fatty acids released from adipocytes with reduced DBC1 expression. In addition, DBC1-knockdown adipocytes had increased  expression. In summary, DBC1 can associate with STAT5A in adipocyte nucleus, but it does not appear to impact regulation of STAT5A target genes. Loss of adipocyte DBC1 modestly increases  gene expression and reduces TNFα-induced lipolysis. These observations are consistent with  observations that show loss of DBC1 promotes metabolic health in mice.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30078194>Endurance training prevents inflammation and apoptosis in hypothalamic neurons of obese mice.</a></h1><p>This study investigated the effects of exercise training in regulating inflammatory processes, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and apoptosis in hypothalamic neurons of obese mice. Swiss mice were distributed into three groups: Lean mice (Lean), sedentary animals fed a standard diet; obese mice (Obese), sedentary animals fed a high- diet (HFD); trained obese mice (T. Obese), animals fed with HFD and concurrently subjected to an endurance training protocol for 8 weeks. In the endurance training protocol, mice ran on a treadmill at 60% of peak workload for 1 hr, 5 days/week for 8 weeks. Twenty-four hours after the last exercise session, the euthanasia was performed. Western blot, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, and terminal deoxynucleotide transferase biotin-dUTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL) techniques were used for the analysis of interest. The results show exercise training increased phosphorylation of leptin signaling pathway proteins (pJAK2/pSTAT3) and reduced the content of tumor necrosis factor α, toll-like receptor 4, suppressor of cytokine signaling 3, protein- phosphatase 1B as well as the phosphorylation of IkB kinase in the hypothalamus of T. Obese animals. A reduction of macrophage activation and phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2α, and protein kinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) were also observed in exercised animals. Furthermore, exercise decreased the expression of the proapoptotic protein (PARP1) and increased anti-inflammatory (IL-10) and antiapoptotic (Bcl2) proteins. Using the TUNEL technique, we observed that the exercised animals had lower DNA fragmentation. Finally, physical exercise preserved pro-opiomelanocortin messenger RNA content. In conclusion, exercise training was able to reorganize the control of the energy balance through anti-inflammatory and antiapoptotic responses in hypothalamic tissue of obese mice.© 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31190846>Improvement of energy substrate  by late evening snack supplementation in patients with liver cirrhosis: a meta-analysis.</a></h1><p> Malnutrition is one of the most common complications in patients with liver cirrhosis. Abnormal energy substrate  may contribute to aggravation of malnutrition. Late evening snack (LESs) supplementation has been recommended as an intervention to reduce starvation time and improve nutritional status. Published studies have analyzed the effect of LESs on the branched-chain amino acid (BCAA)/ ratio (BTR) and oxidation rate of  and carbohydrate in patients with liver cirrhosis.  We searched PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science and Embase for relevant research from January 2000 to October 2018. The primary outcome for this analysis was changes in BTR and  and carbohydrate oxidation in patients with liver cirrhosis.  A total of 9 articles, containing 211 patients, were included in this analysis. The results supported that supplementation with BCAA-enriched LESs improved BTR, and long-term supplementation with BCAAs (>1 month) may be more beneficial than short-term supplementation (<1 month) in patients with liver cirrhosis. In addition, supplementation with BCAAs may increase the oxidation rate of carbohydrates and decrease the oxidation rate of . Furthermore, compared with liquid-enriched LESs, BCAA was a better choice for increasing the oxidation of carbohydrates and decreasing the rate of  oxidation.  BCAA-enriched LES supplementation is an appropriate nutritional intervention to improve abnormal energy substrate , which may improve malnutrition in patients with liver cirrhosis.

Labeled phenylalanine, , and urea tracers were used to estimate protein kinetics, and muscle biopsies were taken for Western blot analysis of protein metabolic signaling.3OHB infusion increased 3OHB concentrations (P < 0.0005) to 3.5 mM and decreased whole-body phenylalanine-to- degradation. Basal and insulin-stimulated net forearm phenylalanine release decreased by >70% (P < 0.005), with both appearance and phenylalanine disappearance being profoundly decreased. Phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2α at Ser51 was increased in skeletal muscle, and S6 kinase phosphorylation at Ser235/236 tended (P = 0.074) to be decreased with 3OHB infusion (suggesting inhibition of protein synthesis), whereas no detectable effects were seen on markers of protein breakdown.  infusion did not affect phenylalanine kinetics, and insulin sensitivity was unaffected by interventions.During acute inflammation, 3OHB has potent anticatabolic actions in muscle and at the whole-body level; in muscle, reduction of protein breakdown overrides inhibition of synthesis.

The prognosis of T2DM patients is highly dependent on the development of complications, and therefore the identification of biomarkers of T2DM progression, with minimally invasive techniques, is a huge need. In the present study, we applied a H-Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (H-NMR)-based metabolomic approach coupled with multivariate data analysis to identify serum metabolite profiles associated with T2DM development and progression. To perform this, we compared the serum metabolome of non-diabetic subjects, treatment-naïve non-complicated T2DM patients, and T2DM patients with complications in insulin monotherapy. Our analysis revealed a significant reduction of alanine, glutamine, glutamate, leucine, lysine, methionine, , and phenylalanine in T2DM patients with respect to non-diabetic subjects. Moreover, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, , and valine levels distinguished complicated patients from patients without complications. Overall, the metabolic pathway analysis suggested that branched-chain amino acid (BCAA)  is significantly compromised in T2DM patients with complications, while perturbation in the  of gluconeogenic amino acids other than BCAAs characterizes both early and advanced T2DM stages. In conclusion, we identified a metabolic serum signature associated with T2DM stages.

In this study, 428 serum samples were collected from 107 pregnant women suffering from GDM and 107 matched healthy controls. The nontargeted metabolomics data of maternal serum samples from the first (T1, n = 214) and second trimesters (T2, n = 214) were acquired by using ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography coupled with Orbitrap mass spectrometry (MS). A total of 93 differential metabolites were identified on the basis of the accurate mass and MS/MS fragmentation. After false discovery rate correction, the levels of 31 metabolites in GDM group were significantly altered in the first trimester. The differential metabolites were mainly attributed to purine , fatty acid β-oxidation, urea cycle, and tricarboxylic acid cycle pathways. The fold changes across pregnancy (T2/T1) of six amino acids (serine, proline, leucine/isoleucine, glutamic acid, , and ornithine), a lysophosphatidylcholine (LysoPC(20:4)), and uric acid in GDM group were significantly different from those in the control groups, suggesting that these 8 metabolites might have contributed to the occurrence and progression of GDM.

These receptors show a high degree of stereoselectivity towards several classes of drugs. This review covers the most relevant findings that have been made in the last decade and takes into consideration only those compounds in which stereochemistry led to unexpected results or peculiar interactions with the receptors. These cases are reviewed and discussed with the aim to show how enantiomeric recognition originates at the molecular level. The structural characterization by crystallographic methods and docking experiments of complexes formed by PPARs with their ligands turns out to be an essential tool to explain receptor stereoselectivity.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS.

However, little is known about the distribution patterns and functions of nNOS in slowly progressive DA neurodegeneration. Here we describe the spatiotemporal change in nNOS expression over the course of neurodegeneration and the effect of short- or long-term treatment with the nNOS inhibitor, 7-nitroindazole (7-NI), in zitter (zi/zi) rats. In the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc), nNOS expression was significantly increased with progression of neurodegeneration. nNOS-immunoreactive (ir) cells were in the vicinity of  hydroxylase-ir (TH-ir) DA neurons, and some of these cells were also positive for calbindin. nNOS in the caudate-putamen (CPu) showed little difference during progression of neurodegeneration. However, immunoelectron microscopic analysis revealed that abundant TH-ir fibers in the CPu were degenerated due to compression by vacuoles that contained swollen neuronal and glial elements. Additionally,  peroxidation as a marker of membrane oxidation was significantly increased in zi/zi rats. Short-term 7-NI treatment attenuated the increase in  peroxidation and inhibited the vacuolation in the CPu. Moreover, long-term 7-NI treatment significantly protected TH-ir neurons in the SNc, and TH-ir fibers and DA contents in the CPu. These results show that nNOS exacerbates slowly progressive DA neurodegeneration, and the neuroprotective effects of 7-NI may result from suppression of membrane oxidation that causes abnormal membrane structures in zi/zi rats.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Deciphering the details of plasma metabolome in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients before and after primary percutaneous coronary interventions (PPCI) would allow for better understanding of the mechanisms involved during acute myocardial ischemia and reperfusion in humans. We performed a detailed non-targeted metabolomic analysis of plasma from 27 STEMI patients who had undergone PPCI in the first 48 hrs employing a LC-MS approach. Plasma metabolome at ischemic condition was compared to multiple time points after PPCI which allowed us to focus on changes in the reperfusion phase. Classification of the differential metabolites based on chemical taxonomy identified a major role for lipids and lipid-derived molecules. Biochemical pathway analysis identified valine, leucine and isoleucine biosynthesis, vitamin B6  and glutathione  as the most significant   representing early response to I/R injury. We also identified phenyl alanine, , linoleic acid and glycerophospholipid  as the most significant  representing late response to I/R injury. A panel of three metabolites pentadecanoic acid, linoleoyl carnitine and 1-linoleoylglycerophosphocholine was discovered to have diagnostic value in determining the extent of I/R injury based on cardiac biomarkers.

However, knowledge of these relationships is lacking in children, despite the growing public health problem posed by childhood obesity. The aim of this study was to assess whether plasma-free amino acid profiles can serve as useful biomarkers of lifestyle-related diseases in children with obesity.This retrospective study used the medical records of 26 patients (15 male, 11 female) aged 9 or 10 years presenting with moderate to severe obesity and hyperlipidemia between April 2015 and March 2017. A degree of obesity of 30% or more was defined as moderate or severe. Amino acid levels were compared between obese children with and without impaired glucose tolerance using a t-test or Mann-Whitney U test. In addition, the influence of factors such as intima media thickness, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, amino acids, and homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) were analyzed pairwise using Pearson's correlation or Spearman's rank correlation.HOMA-IR was positively correlated with valine, leucine (Leu), isoleucine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, methionine, threonine, lysine, alanine, , glutamate (Glu), proline, arginine, ornithine, total free amino acids (all P < 0.01), and aspartate (P = 0.010). Moreover, blood uric acid levels were positively correlated with Leu (P = 0.005) and Glu (P = 0.019), and negatively correlated with serine, glycine, and asparagine (P = 0.007, P = 0.003, and P = 0.013, respectively).Amino acid profile reflects impaired glucose tolerance and hyperuricemia at an early stage of obesity. It is therefore a useful marker to inform early intervention in children with obesity, as in adults.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30179260>Clinical Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Overview of Nilotinib, a Selective  Kinase Inhibitor.</a></h1><p>Nilotinib, an oral inhibitor of the  kinase activity of Abelson protein, is approved for the treatment of patients with newly diagnosed chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in chronic phase and patients with CML in chronic phase or accelerated phase resistant or intolerant to prior therapies. This review describes the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data of nilotinib in patients with CML and in healthy volunteers. Nilotinib is rapidly absorbed, with a peak serum concentration approximately 3 hours after dosing. The area under the plasma drug concentration-time curve over 24 hours and the peak serum concentration of nilotinib were dose proportional from 50-400 mg once daily. The  of nilotinib is primarily via hepatic cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 according to in vitro studies. In the clinical setting, exposure to nilotinib was significantly reduced by the induction of CYP3A4 with rifampicin and significantly increased by the inhibition of CYP3A with ketoconazole. Additionally, nilotinib is a competitive inhibitor of CYP3A4/5, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase 1A1. The bioavailability of nilotinib is increased by up to 82% when given with a high- meal compared with fasted state. There is a positive correlation between the occurrences of all-grade total bilirubin elevations and the steady-state nilotinib trough concentrations. Fredericia method corrected QT interval change from baseline was observed to have a correlation with nilotinib exposure. No significant relationship between nilotinib exposure and major molecular response at 12 months was seen at therapeutic doses of nilotinib 300-400 mg, probably due to the narrow range of the doses investigated.© 2018, The American College of Clinical Pharmacology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30296508>Substitution therapy with amphetamine-isotherapic attenuates amphetamine toxicological aspects of addiction.</a></h1><p>amphetamine (AMPH) is related to development of addiction, anxiety-like behaviors and impairments of memory after chronic use. In the current experiment, an ultra-high dilution (10mg/mL) of AMPH was used, consisting of the AMPH isotherapic (AMPH-ISO), which can be used as a replacement therapy to treat AMPH addiction.To verify the inﬂuence of AMPH-ISO on toxicological aspects of AMPH addiction.Rats received d,l-AMPH (4.0 mg/kg, i.p.) in the conditioned place preference (CPP) paradigm (8 days). Then, half of each experimental group (AMPH or saline) received AMPH-ISO/vehicle (0.2 mL per rat, once a day), for fourteen days. On the fifteenth day, animals were re-assessed in the CPP paradigm (to verify relapse behaviors) after a single dose of AMPH (2.0 mg/kg). Subsequently, anxiety-like behaviors were quantified, followed by ex vivo assays in the pre-frontal cortex.AMPH-ISO prevented relapse-like behavior of AMPH and reduced anxiety-like behavior per se in animals co-treated with AMPH. Molecular analysis evidenced that AMPH-ISO modulated dopaminergic targets (dopamine transporter,  hydroxylase and D1-R), whose immunoreactivity was increased by AMPH. Also, AMPH-ISO increased catalase activity and NPSH levels and reduced  peroxidation and protein carbonyl levels in the prefrontal cortex.This study shows that an ultra-high dilution of AMPH may be a useful alternative which can contribute with AMPH addiction treatment.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The neuropathological hallmarks of PD are well reported, but the etiology of the disease is still undefined; several studies assume that oxidative stress, mitochondrial defects, and neuroinflammation play vital roles in the progress of the disease. The current study was established to investigate the neuroprotective effect of agmatine on a rotenone (ROT)-induced experimental model of PD. Adult male Sprague Dawley rats were subcutaneously injected with ROT at a dose of 2 mg/kg body weight for 35 days. Agmatine was injected intraperitoneally at 50 and 100 mg/kg body weight, 1 h prior to ROT administration. ROT-treated rats that received agmatine showed better performance on beam walking and an elevated number of rears within the cylinder test. In addition, agmatine reduced midbrain malondialdehyde as an indication of  peroxidation, pro-inflammatory cytokines including tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin-1β, and glial fibrillary acidic protein. Moreover, agmatine was responsible for preventing loss of  hydroxylase-positive neurons. In conclusion, our study showed that agmatine possesses a dose-dependent neuroprotective effect through its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. These findings need further clinical investigations of agmatine as a promising neuroprotective agent for the future treatment of PD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30664970>Modafinil reduces amphetamine preference and prevents anxiety-like symptoms during drug withdrawal in young rats: Involvement of dopaminergic targets in VTA and striatum.</a></h1><p>Drug abuse and addiction are overwhelming health problems mainly during adolescence. Based on a previous study of our research group, the rats that received modafinil (MD) during the adolescence showed less preference for amphetamine (AMPH) in adulthood. Our current hypothesis is that MD will show beneficial effects against AMPH preference and abstinence symptoms during adolescence, a critical lifetime period when drug hedonic effects are more pronounced. We investigated the influence of MD pretreatment on AMPH preference in conditioned place preference (CPP) paradigm in adolescent rats and anxiety-like symptoms during drug withdrawal (48 h after the last AMPH dose) in elevated plus maze (EPM) task. Besides that, oxidative and molecular status were evaluated in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and striatum. Our findings showed, as it was expected, that adolescent animals developed AMPH preference together with anxiety-like symptoms during the drug withdrawal while the MD pretreatment prevented those behaviors. Besides promoting benefits on reward parameters, MD was able to preserve VTA and striatum from oxidative damages. This was observed by the increased catalase activity and reduced generation of reactive species and  peroxidation, which were inversely modified by AMPH exposure. At molecular level, MD exerted an interesting modulatory activity on the VTA and induced an up-regulation in striatal dopaminergic targets (TH, DAT, D1R and D2R). So far, during the adolescence, MD presented beneficial behavioral outcomes that could be attributed to its modulatory activity on the striatal dopaminergic system in an attempt to maintain the adequate dopamine levels.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Herein, comparative metabolomics was adopted to analyze the variations in the hemolymph metabolites of different resistant silkworm strains following BmNPV inoculation using a H NMR method. Trehalose, as an instant source of energy, plays a crucial role in the response to pathogen infections in insects. The level of trehalose was persistently upregulated in the hemolymph of the resistant silkworm strain YeA following infection with BmNPV, compared to that of the susceptible strain YeB, indicating that trehalose  plays a vital role in the response to BmNPV infection. The significant upregulation of TCA cycle relevant metabolites, including malate, fumarate, citrate, succinate, and α-ketoglutarate, was identified at 0 h, 12 h, 48 h, and 96 h post-infection in YeA hemolymph, whereas a significant upregulation in YeB hemolymph was only detected at an early stage of infection (0 h-24 h). The expression level of selected key metabolic enzymes, determined using RT-qPCR, validated the differences in trehalose and TCA cycle relevant metabolite levels. The variations in branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) pathway relevant metabolites in resistant silkworm strains following BmNPV infection showed a regular undulation at different times after infection. A significant accumulation of phenylalanine and  was observed in YeA following BmNPV infection compared to YeB. The glycolysis and gluconeogenesis pathways showed a relatively low activity in YeA following BmNPV infection. Moreover, the levels of other metabolites related to , transamination, energy , and glycometabolism, such as glycine, threonine, glutamine, and glutamate, were unstable in the two silkworm strains following BmNPV infection. Thus, our study provides an overview of the metabolic response of the silkworm in response to BmNPV infection, which lays the foundation for clarifying the mechanism of silkworm resistance to BmNPV infection.Copyright © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

MerTK is mainly expressed in anti-inflammatory M2 macrophages where it mediates transcriptional changes including suppression of proinflammatory cytokines and enhancement of inflammatory repressors. MerTK is regulated by metabolic pathways through nuclear sensors including LXRs, PPARs, and RXRs, in response to apoptotic bodies or to other sources of cholesterol. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is one of the most serious public health problems worldwide. It is a clinicopathological syndrome closely related to obesity, insulin resistance, and oxidative stress. It includes a spectrum of conditions ranging from simple steatosis, characterized by hepatic  accumulation with or without inflammation, to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), defined by hepatic  deposition with hepatocellular damage, inflammation, and accumulating fibrosis. Several studies support an association between NAFLD and the incidence of cardiovascular diseases including atherosclerosis, a major cause of death worldwide. This pathological condition consists in a chronic and progressive inflammatory process in the intimal layer of large- and medium-sized arteries. The complications of advanced atherosclerosis include chronic or acute ischemic damage in the tissue perfused by the affected artery, leading to cellular death. By identifying specific targets influencing  and cardiovascular-related diseases, the present review highlights the role of MerTK in NAFLD-associated atherosclerotic lesions as a potential innovative therapeutic target. Therapeutic advantages might derive from the use of compounds selective for nuclear receptors targeting PPARs rather than LXRs regulating macrophage  and macrophage mediated inflammation, by favoring the expression of MerTK, which mediates an immunoregulatory action with a reduction in inflammation and in atherosclerosis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31237372>RhoA in  hydroxylase neurones regulates food intake and body weight via altered sensitivity to peripheral hormones.</a></h1><p>Dopamine-producing  hydroxylase (TH) neurones in the hypothalamic arcuate nucleus (ARC) have recently been shown to be involved in ghrelin signalling and body weight homeostasis. In the present study, we investigate the role of the intracellular regulator RhoA in hypothalamic TH neurones in response to peripheral hormones. Diet-induced obesity was found to be associated with increased phosphorylation of TH in ARC, indicating obesity-associated increased activity of ARC TH neurones. Mice in which RhoA was specifically knocked out in TH neurones (TH-RhoA mice) were more sensitive to the orexigenic effect of peripherally administered ghrelin and displayed an abolished response to the anorexigenic hormone leptin. When TH-RhoA mice were challenged with a high- high-sucrose (HFHS) diet, they became hyperphagic and gained more body weight and  mass compared to wild-type control mice. Importantly, lack of RhoA prevented development of ghrelin resistance, which is normally observed in wild-type mice after long-term HFHS diet feeding. Patch-clamp electrophysiological analysis demonstrated increased ghrelin-induced excitability of TH neurones in lean TH-RhoA mice compared to lean littermate control animals. Additionally, increased expression of the orexigenic hypothalamic neuropeptides agouti-related peptide and neuropeptide Y was observed in TH-RhoA mice. Overall, our data indicate that TH neurones in ARC are important for the regulation of body weight homeostasis and that RhoA is both a central effector in these neurones and important for the development of obesity-induced ghrelin resistance. The obese phenotype of TH-RhoA mice may be a result of increased sensitivity to ghrelin and decreased sensitivity to leptin, resulting in increased food intake.© 2019 British Society for Neuroendocrinology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31160709>Mitochondrial fusion regulates  homeostasis and stem cell maintenance in the Drosophila testis.</a></h1><p>The capacity of stem cells to self-renew or differentiate has been attributed to distinct metabolic states. A genetic screen targeting regulators of mitochondrial dynamics revealed that mitochondrial fusion is required for the maintenance of male germline stem cells (GSCs) in Drosophila melanogaster. Depletion of Mitofusin (dMfn) or Opa1 led to dysfunctional mitochondria, activation of Target of rapamycin (TOR) and a marked accumulation of  droplets. Enhancement of  utilization by the mitochondria attenuated TOR activation and rescued the loss of GSCs that was caused by inhibition of mitochondrial fusion. Moreover, constitutive activation of the TOR-pathway target and lipogenesis factor Sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP) also resulted in GSC loss, whereas inhibition of SREBP rescued GSC loss triggered by depletion of dMfn. Our findings highlight a critical role for mitochondrial fusion and  homeostasis in GSC maintenance, providing insight into the potential impact of mitochondrial and metabolic diseases on the function of stem and/or germ cells.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30279692>T Cells on Engineered Substrates: The Impact of TCR Clustering Is Enhanced by LFA-1 Engagement.</a></h1><p>We created APC-mimetic synthetic substrates to study the impact of ligand clustering on T cell activation and spreading. The substrates exhibit antibodies directed against the TCR-complex in the form of a patterned array of sub micrometric dots surrounded by a fluid supported  bilayer (SLB) which may itself be functionalized with another bio-molecule. We show that for T cell adhesion mediated by T cell receptor (TCR) alone, in the patterned, but not in the corresponding homogeneous controls, the TCR, ZAP-70 and actin are present in the form of clusters or patches that co-localize with the ligand-dots. However, global cell scale parameters like cell area and actin distribution are only weakly impacted by ligand clustering. In presence of ICAM-1 - the ligand of the T cell integrin LFA-1 - on the SLB, the TCR is still clustered due to the patterning of its ligands, but now global parameters are also impacted. The actin organization changes to a peripheral ring, resembling the classical actin distribution seen on homogeneous substrates, the patterned membrane topography disappears and the membrane is flat, whereas the cell area increases significantly. These observations taken together point to a possible pivotal role for LFA-1 in amplifying the effect of TCR-clustering. No such effect is evident for co-engagement of CD28, affected  its ligand B7.2. Unlike on ICAM-1, on B7.2 cell spreading and actin organization are similar for homogeneous and patterned substrates. However, TCR and ZAP-70 clusters are still formed in the patterned case. These results indicate complementary role for LFA-1 and CD28 in the regulation and putative coupling of TCR micro-clusters to actin. The engineered substrates presented here clearly have the potential to act as platform for fundamental research in immune cell biology, as well as translational analyses in immunotherapy, for example to screen molecules for their role in T cell adhesion/activation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30755372>Inhibition of oncogenic Src induces FABP4-mediated lipolysis via PPARγ activation exerting cancer growth suppression.</a></h1><p>c-Src is a driver oncogene well-known for tumorigenic signaling, but little for metabolic function. Previous reports about c-Src regulation of glucose  prompted us to investigate its function in other nutrient modulation, particularly in .Oil-red O staining, cell growth assay, and tumor volume measurement were performed to determine  amount and growth inhibitory effect of treatments in lung cancer cells and xenograft model. Gene expression was evaluated by immunoblotting and relative RT-PCR. Transcriptional activity of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) was assessed by luciferase assay. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) was measured using ROS sensing dye. Oxygen consumption rate was evaluated by Seahorse XF Mito Stress Test. Clinical relevance of candidate proteins was examined using patient samples and public database analysis.Inhibition of Src induced lipolysis and increased intracellular ROS. Src inhibition derepressed PPARγ transcriptional activity leading to induced expression of lipolytic gene fatty acid binding protein (FABP) 4 which accompanies reduced  droplets and decreased tumor growth. The reverse correlation of Src and FABP4 was confirmed in pair-matched lung cancer patient samples, and further analysis using public datasets revealed upregulation of lipolytic genes is associated with better prognosis of cancer patients.This study provides an insight of how oncogenic factor Src concurrently regulates both cellular signaling pathways and metabolic plasticity to drive cancer progression.

This study investigated malondialdehyde (MDA), nitrotyrosine (3-NT), and protein carbonyls (PrCarb) as markers of oxidative stress and antioxidant status by serum alpha tocopherol level in young Nigerian women with dysmenorrhea.In a case-control design, 45 female undergraduates who had had regular menses for at least six previous cycles were recruited consecutively from a university clinic as cases and 45 apparently healthy age-matched counterparts in their hall of residences as controls. Serum levels of MDA, 3-NT, and PrCarb were determined using standard methods, and the values were compared between cases and controls using Mann-Whitney U-test and graphs.Study participants' ages range from 16 to 29 years (mean = 22.0 ± 3.1 years). Serum level of 3-NT (45.89 ± 37.11 vs 21.27 ± 13.94 ng/mL) and MDA (0.75 ± 0.19 vs 0.45 ± 0.11 nmol/mL) was significantly higher in cases than controls. Plasma alpha tocopherol was significantly lower in cases (7.51 ± 1.95 μmol/L) than controls (8.98 ± 1.95 μmol/L). Conversely, PrCarb levels were not significantly difference between cases and controls. There were significant correlations between alpha tocopherol and 3-NT (r = -0.285; P = 0.007) and MDA (r = -0.321; P = 0.002), whereas this relationship was not shown with PrCarb (r = -0.073; P = 0.496).Remarkable  and protein peroxidation observed in young Nigerian women with dysmenorrhea was accompanied by correspondingly low level of serum alpha tocopherol suggesting potential need for vitamin E supplementation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30655560>Thermopriming reprograms metabolic homeostasis to confer heat tolerance.</a></h1><p>Heat stress threatens agriculture worldwide. Plants acquire heat stress tolerance through priming, which establishes stress memory during mild or severe transient heat stress. Such induced thermotolerance restructures metabolic networks and helps maintain metabolic homeostasis under heat stress. Here, we used an electrospray ionization mass spectrometry-based platform to explore the composition and dynamics of the metabolome of Arabidopsis thaliana under heat stress and identify metabolites involved in thermopriming. Primed plants performed better than non-primed plants under severe heat stress due to altered energy pathways and increased production of branched-chain amino acids, raffinose family oligosaccharides (RFOs), lipolysis products, and tocopherols. These metabolites serve as osmolytes, antioxidants and growth precursors to help plants recover from heat stress, while  metabolites help protect membranes against heat stress. The carbohydrate (e.g., sucrose and RFOs) and  superpathway metabolites showed the most significant increases. Under heat stress, there appears to be crosstalk between carbohydrate  (i.e., the thermomemory metabolites stachyose, galactinol, and raffinose) and   towards the production of the thermomemory metabolite salidroside, a phenylethanoid glycoside. Crosstalk occurs between two glycerophospholipid pathways (the biosynthetic pathways of the thermomemory metabolite S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine and the terpenoid backbone) and the δ-tocopherol (chloroplast ) pathway, which favors the production of glycine betaine and other essential tocopherols, respectively, compounds which are essential for abiotic stress tolerance in plants. Therefore, metabolomic analysis can provide comprehensive insights into the metabolites involved in stress responses, which could facilitate plant breeding to maximize crop yields under adverse conditions.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30735525>Epidermal growth factor receptor inhibition attenuates non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in diet-induced obese mice.</a></h1><p>Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is one of the main causes of chronic liver disease.

Here, we investigated whether inhibiting EGFR using the EGFR  kinase inhibitor (TKI) PD153035 improves NAFLD. Our results demonstrate that EGFR was activated in liver tissues from high  diet (HFD)-induced NAFLD mice. Inhibiting EGFR using PD153035 significantly reduced phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/protein kinase B signaling and sterol responsive elementary binding protein 1 and 2 expression, which prevented HFD-induced hepatic steatosis and hypercholesterolemia by reducing de novo lipogenesis and cholesterol synthesis and enhancing fatty acid oxidation. Additionally, inhibiting EGFR improved HFD-induced glucose intolerance. In conclusion, these results indicate that EGFR plays an important role in NAFLD and is a potential therapeutic target.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29779472>Effect of Body Weight on Metabolic Hormones and Fatty Acid  in Follicular Fluid of Women Undergoing In Vitro Fertilization: A Pilot Study.</a></h1><p>Obesity is an epidemic affecting more than one-third of adults in the United States. Obese women experience decreased fertility, explained in part by oocyte quality. Since follicular fluid (FF) provides an important microenvironment for oocyte growth, we sought to evaluate the effect of increased body weight on FF levels of 11 metabolic hormones and fatty acid .The FF was collected from 25 women (10 normal weight, 10 overweight, and 5 obese) with diminished ovarian reserve undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF) following a minimal stimulation protocol. Hormone levels were determined by multiplex immunoassay using the MAGPIX (Luminex, Austin, Texas) instrument. Fatty acid metabolites were determined using gas and ultra-high pressure liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry.Levels of hormones related to glucose and energy homeostasis and regulation of  stores (insulin, glucagon, glucagon-like peptide-1, C-peptide, and leptin) were increased significantly in FF from obese women compared to FF from nonobese(normal weight and overweight) women. Interestingly, FF levels of branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) isoleucine, leucine, and valine as well as uric acid, isocaproic acid, butanoic acid, , threonine, glycine, and methionine correlated positively with body mass index.This pilot study demonstrates significant alterations in the FF milieu of obese women undergoing IVF, which may contribute to the decreased fecundity of obese women. Although the impact of this environment on oocyte and embryo development is not fully realized, these changes may also lead to imprinting at the genomic level and long-term sequelae on offspring.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30226590>Preclinical investigation of folate receptor-targeted nanoparticles for photodynamic therapy of malignant pleural mesothelioma.</a></h1><p>Photodynamic therapy (PDT) following lung-sparing extended pleurectomy for malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) has been investigated as a potential means to kill residual microscopic cells. High expression levels of folate receptor 1 (FOLR1) have been reported in MPM; therefore, targeting FOLR1 has been considered a novel potential strategy. The present study developed FOLR1‑targeting porphyrin- nanoparticles (folate-porphysomes, FP) for the treatment of PDT. Furthermore, inhibition of activated epidermal growth factor (EGFR)-associated survival pathways enhance PDT efficacy. In the present study, these approaches were combined; FP-based PDT was used together with an EGFR- kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI). The frequency of FOLR1 and EGFR expression in MPM was analyzed using tissue microarrays. Confocal microscopy and a cell viability assay were performed to confirm the specificity of FOLR1‑targeting cellular uptake and photocytotoxicity in vitro. In vivo fluorescence activation and therapeutic efficacy were subsequently examined. The effects of EGFR-TKI were also assessed in vitro. The in vivo combined antitumor effect of EGFR-TKI and FP-PDT was then evaluated. The results revealed that FOLR1 and EGFR were expressed in 79 and 89% of MPM samples, respectively. In addition, intracellular uptake of FP corresponded well with FOLR1 expression. When MPM cells were incubated with FP and then irradiated at 671 nm, there was significant in vitro cell death, which was inhibited in the presence of free folic acid, thus suggesting the specificity of FPs. FOLR1 targeting resulted in disassembly of the porphysomes and subsequent fluorescence activation in intrathoracic disseminated MPM tumors, as demonstrated by ex vivo tissue imaging. FP-PDT resulted in significant cellular damage and apoptosis in vivo. Furthermore, the combination of pretreatment with EGFR-TKI and FP-PDT induced a marked improvement of treatment responses. In conclusion, FP-based PDT induced selective destruction of MPM cells based on FOLR1 targeting, and pretreatment with EGFR-TKI further enhanced the therapeutic response.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31400786>Age- and diet-specific effects of chronic exposure to chlorpyrifos on hormones, inflammation and gut microbiota in rats.</a></h1><p>Chlorpyrifos is a pesticide frequently detected in food and has been reported to disturb endocrine and gut health, which was regulated by gut microbiota and enteroendocrine cells. In this study, newly weaned (3 week) and adult (8 week) male rats fed a normal- or high- fat diet were chronically exposed to 0.3 mg chlorpyrifos/kg bodyweight/day. The effects of chlorpyrifos exposure on serum hormone levels, proinflammatory cytokines and gut microbiota were evaluated. Chronic exposure to chlorpyrifos significantly decreased the concentrations of luteinizing hormone, follicule stimulating hormone and testosterone, which was found only in the normal-fat diet. The counteracted effect of high-fat diet was also found in gut hormones and proinflammatory cytokines. Significantly higher concentrations of glucagon-like peptide-1, pancreatic polypeptide, peptide   (PYY), ghrelin, gastric inhibitory poly-peptide, IL-6, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, and TNF-α were found in rats exposed to chlorpyrifos beginning at newly weaned, whereas only the PYY, ghrelin and IL-6 concentrations increased significantly in rats exposed in adulthood. Furthermore, a decrease in epinephrine induced by chlorpyrifos exposure was found in rats exposed to chlorpyrifos beginning at newly weaned, regardless of their diet. Chlorpyrifos-induced disturbances in the microbiome community structure were more apparent in rats fed a high-fat diet and exposed beginning at newly weaned. The affected bacteria included short-chain fatty acid-producing bacteria (Romboutsia, Turicibacter, Clostridium sensu stricto 1, norank_f_Coriobacteriaceae, Faecalibaculum, Parasutterella and norank_f__Erysipelotrichaceae), testosterone-related genus (Turicibacter, Brevibacterium), pathogenic bacteria (Streptococcus), and inflammation-related bacteria (unclassified_f__Ruminococcaceae, Ruminococcaceae_UCG-009, Parasutterella, Oscillibacter), which regulated the endocrine system via the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, as well as the immune response and gut barrier. Early exposure accelerated the endocrine-disturbing effect and immune responses of chlorpyrifos, although these effects can be eased or recovered by a high-fat diet. This study helped clarify the relationship between disrupted endocrine function and gut microbiota dysbiosis induced by food contaminants such as pesticides.Copyright © 2019 The Authors.

The majority of its actions are mediated by the transcription factor, VD3 receptor (VD3R).The neuroprotective effects of VD3 were investigated on a PD model. Male Wistar rats were divided into the following groups: sham-operated (SO), 6-OHDA-lesioned (non-treated), and 6-OHDA-lesioned and treated with VD3 (7 days before the lesion, pre-treatment or for 14 days after the 6-OHDA striatal lesion, post-treatment). Afterwards, the animals were subjected to behavioral tests and euthanized for striatal neurochemical and immunohistochemical assays. The data were analyzed by ANOVA and the Tukey test and considered significant for p < 0.05.We showed that pre- or post-treatments with VD3 reversed behavioral changes and improved the decreased DA contents of the 6-OHDA group. In addition, VD3 reduced the oxidative stress, increased (TH and DAT), and reduced (TNF-alpha) immunostainings in the lesioned striata. While significant decreases in VD3R immunoreactivity were observed after the 6-OHDA lesion, these changes were blocked after VD3 pre- or post-treatments. We showed that VD3 offers neuroprotection, decreasing behavioral changes, DA depletion, and oxidative stress. In addition, it reverses partially or completely TH, DAT, TNF-alpha, and VD3R decreases of immunoreactivities in the non-treated 6-OHDA group.Taken together, VD3 effects could result from its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant actions and from its actions on VD3R. These findings should stimulate translational research towards the VD3 potential for prevention or treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, as PD.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30145885>Flaxseed Oil Attenuates Hepatic Steatosis and Insulin Resistance in Mice by Rescuing the Adaption to ER Stress.</a></h1><p>Increasing evidence has demonstrated the benefits of α-linolenic acid-rich flaxseed oil (ALA-FO) against  abnormality in both rodent models and humans. However, the metabolic response of FO to insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes is still inconsistent. This study aimed to explore the effect of FO on chronic high  diet (HFD)-induced hepatic steatosis, insulin resistance, and inflammation, mainly focusing on hepatic n-3 fatty acid remodeling and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) unfolded protein response. The results showed that lard-based HFD feeding for 16 weeks (60% -derived calories) induced whole-body insulin resistance,  profile abnormality, and inflammation in mice, which was alleviated by FO in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, FO effectively improved hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance in mice by modulating the specific location of ALA and its long-chain n-3 fatty acids across hepatic  fractions and enhancing insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of hepatic insulin receptor subtract-1 (IRS-1)  632 and protein kinase B (AKT) ( p < 0.05). Importantly, the differential depositions of ALA and its long-chain n-3 fatty acids in plasma and ER membranes were observed, concomitant with the rescued ER unfolded protein response and Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling in mice liver.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30611309>Star-related  transfer protein 10 (STARD10): a novel key player in alcohol-induced breast cancer progression.</a></h1><p>Ethanol abuse promotes breast cancer development, metastasis and recurrence stimulating mammary tumorigenesis by mechanisms that remain unclear. Normally, 35% of breast cancer is Erb-B2 Receptor  Kinase 2 (ERBB2)-positive that predisposes to poor prognosis and relapse, while ethanol drinking leads to invasion of their ERBB2 positive cells triggering the phosphorylation status of mitogen-activated protein kinase. StAR-related  transfer protein 10 (STARD10) is a  transporter of phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE); changes on membrane composition of PC and PE occur before the morphological tumorigenic events. Interestingly, STARD10 has been described to be highly expressed in 35-40% of ERBB2-positive breast cancers. In this study, we demonstrate that ethanol administration promotes STARD10 and ERBB2 expression that is significantly associated with increased cell malignancy and aggressiveness.We investigated the effect of ethanol on STARD10-ERBB2 cross-talk in breast cancer cells, MMTV-neu transgenic mice and in clinical ERBB2-positive breast cancer specimens with Western Blotting and Real-time PCR. We also examined the effects of their knockdown and overexpression on transient transfected breast cancer cells using promoter activity, MTT, cell migration, calcium and membrane fluidity assays in vitro.Ethanol administration induces STARD10 and ERBB2 expression in vitro and in vivo. ERBB2 overexpression causes an increase in STARD10 expression, while overexpression of ERBB2's downstream targets, p65, c-MYC, c-FOS or c-JUN induces STARD10 promoter activity, correlative of enhanced ERBB2 function. Ethanol and STARD10-mediated cellular membrane fluidity and intracellular calcium concentration impact ERBB2 signaling pathway as evaluated by enhanced p65 nuclear translocation and binding to both ERBB2 and STARD10 promoters.Our finding proved that STARD10 and ERBB2 positively regulate each other's expression and function. Taken together, our data demonstrate that ethanol can modulate ERBB2's function in breast cancer via a novel interplay with STARD10.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30088983>High- diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance in CYP4a14 mice is mediated by 20-HETE.</a></h1><p>20-Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (20-HETE) has been shown to positively correlate with body mass index, hyperglycemia, and plasma insulin levels. This study seeks to identify a causal relationship between 20-HETE and obesity-driven insulin resistance. Cyp4a14 male mice, a model of 20-HETE overproduction, were fed a regular or high- diet (HFD) for 15 wk. 20-SOLA [2,5,8,11,14,17-hexaoxanonadecan-19-yl 20-hydroxyeicosa-6( Z),15( Z)-dienoate], a 20-HETE antagonist, was administered from week 0 or week 7 of HFD. HFD-fed mice gained significant weight (16.7 ± 3.2 vs. 3.8 ± 0.35 g, P < 0.05) and developed hyperglycemia (157 ± 3 vs. 121 ± 7 mg/dl, P < 0.05) and hyperinsulinemia (2.3 ± 0.4 vs. 0.5 ± 0.1 ng/ml, P < 0.05) compared with regular diet-fed mice. 20-SOLA attenuated HFD-induced weight gain (9.4 ± 1 vs. 16.7 ± 3 g, P < 0.05) and normalized the hyperglycemia (157 ± 7 vs. 102 ± 5 mg/dl, P < 0.05) and hyperinsulinemia (1.1 ± 0.1 vs. 2.3 ± 0.4 ng/ml, P < 0.05). The impaired glucose homeostasis and insulin resistance in HFD-fed mice evidenced by reduced insulin and glucose tolerance were also ameliorated by 20-SOLA. Circulatory and adipose tissue 20-HETE levels significantly increased in HFD-fed mice correlating with impaired insulin signaling, including reduction in insulin receptor  (Y972) phosphorylation and increased serine (S307) phosphorylation of the insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1). 20-SOLA treatments prevented changes in insulin signaling. These findings indicate that 20-HETE contributes to HFD-induced obesity, insulin resistance, and impaired insulin signaling.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30039351>Mechanisms of the antilipolytic response of human adipocytes to tyramine, a trace amine present in food.</a></h1><p>Tyramine is found in foodstuffs, the richest being cheeses, sausages, and wines. Tyramine has been recognized to release catecholamines from nerve endings and to trigger hypertensive reaction. Thereby, tyramine-free diet is recommended for depressed patients treated with irreversible inhibitors of monoamine oxidases (MAO) to limit the risk of hypertension. Tyramine is a substrate of amine oxidases and also an agonist at trace amine-associated receptors. Our aim was to characterize the dose-dependent effects of tyramine on human adipocyte metabolic functions. Lipolytic activity was determined in adipocytes from human subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue. Glycerol release was increased by a fourfold factor with classical lipolytic agents (1 μM isoprenaline, 1 mM isobutylmethylxanthine) while the amine was ineffective from 0.01 to 100 μM and hardly stimulatory at 1 mM. Tyramine exhibited a partial antilipolytic effect at 100 μM and 1 mM, which was similar to that of insulin but weaker than that obtained with agonists at purinergic A1 receptors, α-adrenoceptors, or nicotinic acid receptors. Gi-protein blockade by Pertussis toxin abolished all these antilipolytic responses save that of tyramine. Indeed, tyramine antilipolytic effect was impaired by MAO-A inhibition. Tyramine inhibited protein  phosphatase activities in a manner sensitive to ascorbic acid and amine oxidase inhibitors. Thus, millimolar tyramine restrained lipolysis via the hydrogen peroxide it generates when oxidized by MAO. Since tyramine plasma levels have been reported to reach 0.2 μM after ingestion of 200 mg tyramine in healthy individuals, the direct effects we observed in vitro on adipocytes could be nutritionally relevant only when the MAO-dependent hepato-intestinal detoxifying system is overpassed.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29877041>Clinical characteristics of adolescent cases with Type A insulin resistance syndrome caused by heterozygous mutations in the β-subunit of the insulin receptor (INSR) gene.</a></h1><p>Type A insulin resistance (IR) is a rare form of severe congenital IR that is frequently caused by heterozygous mutations in the insulin receptor (INSR) gene. Although Type A IR requires appropriate intervention from the early stages of diabetes, proper diagnosis of this disease is challenging, and accumulation of cases with detailed clinical profiles and genotypes is required.Herein we report on six peripubertal patients with clinically diagnosed Type A IR, including four patients with an identified INSR mutation. To clarify the clinical features of Type A IR due to INSR mutation, we validated the clinical characteristics of Type A IR patients with identified INSR mutations by comparing them with mutation-negative patients.Four heterozygous missense mutations within the β-subunit of INSR were detected: Gly1146Arg, Arg1158Trp, Arg1201Trp, and one novel Arg1201Pro mutation. There were no obvious differences in clinical phenotypes, except for normal  and autosomal dominant inheritance, between Type A IR due to INSR mutations and Type A IR due to other factors. However, our analysis revealed that the extent of growth retardation during the fetal period is correlated with the severity of insulin signaling impairment.The present study details the clinical features of four patients with genetically proven Type A IR. Further accumulation of genetically proven cases and long-term treatment prognoses following early diagnosis are required to further elucidate the dynamics of this disease.© 2018 Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30576689>Ectopic  deposition mediates insulin resistance in adipose specific 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 transgenic mice.</a></h1><p>Excessive adipose glucocorticoid action is associated with insulin resistance, but the mechanisms linking adipose glucocorticoid action to insulin resistance are still debated. We hypothesized that insulin resistance from excess glucocorticoid action may be attributed in part to increased ectopic  deposition in liver.We tested this hypothesis in the adipose specific 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase-1 (HSD11B1) transgenic mouse, an established model of adipose glucocorticoid excess. Tissue specific insulin action was assessed by hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps, hepatic  content was measured, hepatic insulin signaling was assessed by immunoblotting. The role of hepatic  content was further probed by administration of the functionally liver-targeted mitochondrial uncoupler, Controlled Release Mitochondrial Protonophore (CRMP).High  diet fed HSD11B1 transgenic mice developed more severe hepatic insulin resistance than littermate controls (endogenous suppression of hepatic glucose production was reduced by 3.8-fold, P < 0.05); this was reflected by decreased insulin-stimulated hepatic insulin receptor kinase  phosphorylation and AKT serine phosphorylation. Hepatic insulin resistance was associated with a 53% increase (P < 0.05) in hepatic triglyceride content, a 73% increase in diacylglycerol content (P < 0.01), and a 66% increase in PKCε translocation (P < 0.05). Hepatic insulin resistance was prevented with administration of CRMP by reversal of hepatic steatosis and prevention of hepatic diacylglycerol accumulation and PKCε activation.These findings are consistent with excess adipose glucocorticoid activity being a predisposing factor for the development of  (diacylglycerol-PKCε)-induced hepatic insulin resistance.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Contrasting effects have been reported, even for a given molecule. Hyperglycemia rates range between 15 and 40%; nilotinib seems to be the molecule most liable to induce diabetes. Metabolic effects range from metabolic syndrome to onset of diabetes, requiring treatment based on insulin resistance, although pathophysiology is unclear. It is noteworthy that fulminant diabetes has never been reported under TKIs. TKIs may lead to hypoglycemia in type 1 or 2 diabetes. Several cases have been reported of improvement in glycemia and in HbA1c, with reduction or even termination of insulin therapy, mainly under imatinib and sunitinib. Fasting glucose levels should be checked before, during and after treatment, plus HbA1C in diabetic patients, with reinforced self-monitoring. These side-effects are transient and never contraindicate continuation of TKIs. Dyslipidemia under TKI has been reported, concerning both LDL-cholesterol and triglycerides.

Enrichment or deprivation of membrane cholesterol affects the activities of manysignaling molecules at the plasma membrane. Cell detachment changes the structure of the plasmamembrane and influences the localizations of lipids, including cholesterol. Recent studies showedthat cell detachment changes the activities of a variety of signaling molecules. We previously reportedthat the localization and the function of the Src-family kinase Lyn are critically regulated by its membrane anchorage through  modifications. More recently, we found that the localization andthe activity of Lyn were changed upon cell detachment, although the manners of which vary betweencell types.

This study evaluated chronic physiological effects of AgNPs on Daphnia similis, which were exposed to two ambient encountered concentrations (0.02 and 1 ppb) of AgNPs for 21 days. It was observed that the low-dose AgNPs stimulated a significant increase in average length/dry mass, but inhibited reproduction compared to control specimens. Non-targeted metabolomics based on liquid chromatography-quadrupole-time of flight-mass spectrometry (LC-QTOFMS-MS) and gas chromatograph-quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry (GC-QTOF-MS) were utilized to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms of these responses. Forty one metabolites were identified, including 18 significantly-changed metabolites, suggesting up regulation in protein digestion and absorption (amino acids, such as isoleucine, tryptophan, lysine, leucine, valine, aspartic acid, threonine, ) and down regulation of  related  (fatty acids, such as arachidonic acid, stearidonic acid, linoelaidic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid) were key events in these responses. The increase in these amino acid contents explains the accelerated growth of D. similis from the metabolic pathway of aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis. Down regulation of fatty acid contents corresponds to the observed drop in the reproduction rate considering the fatty acid biological enzymatic reaction pathways. Significant changes in metabolites provided a renewed mechanistic understanding of low concentration chronic toxicity of AgNP toxicity on D. similis.Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Here, we demonstrate that mouse bone marrow-derived TORC2-deficient myeloid DC (TORC2 DC) utilize an altered  program, characterized by enhanced baseline glycolytic function compared to wild-type WT control (Ctrl) DC, increased dependence on glycolytic ATP production, elevated lipid content and higher viability following stimulation with LPS. In addition, TORC2 DC display an increased spare respiratory capacity (SRC) compared to WT Ctrl DC; this  phenotype corresponds with increased mitochondrial mass and mean mitochondrial DNA copy number, and failure of TORC2 DC mitochondria to depolarize following LPS stimulation. Our data suggest that the enhanced  activity of TORC2 DC may be due to compensatory TORC1 pathway activity, namely increased expression of multiple genes upstream of Akt/TORC1 activity, including the integrin alpha IIb, protein  kinase 2/focal adhesion kinase, IL-7R and Janus kinase 1(JAK1), and the activation of downstream targets of TORC1, including p70S6K, eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E binding protein 1 (4EBP1) and CD36 (fatty acid translocase). These enhanced TORC1 pathway activities may culminate in increased expression of the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (Pparγ) that regulates fatty acid storage, and the transcription factor sterol regulatory element-binding transcription factor 1 (Srebf1). Taken together, our data suggest that TORC2 may function to restrain TORC1-driven  activity and mitochondrial regulation in myeloid DC.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30126894>Transient Overexpression of Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A in Adipose Tissue Promotes Energy Expenditure via Activation of the Sympathetic Nervous System.</a></h1><p>Adipose-derived vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) stimulates functional blood vessel formation in obese  pads, which in turn facilitates healthy expansion of the adipose tissue. However, the detailed mechanism(s) governing the process remains largely unknown. Here, we investigated the role of sympathetic nervous system activation in the process. To this end, we induced overexpression of VEGF-A in an adipose tissue-specific doxycycline (Dox)-inducible transgenic mouse model for a short period of time during high- diet (HFD) feeding. We found that local overexpression of VEGF-A in adipose tissue stimulated lipolysis and browning rapidly after Dox induction. Immunofluorescence staining against  hydroxylase (TH) indicated higher levels of sympathetic innervation in adipose tissue of transgenic mice. In response to an increased norepinephrine (NE) level, expression of β3-adrenoceptor was significantly upregulated, and the downstream protein kinase A (PKA) pathway was activated, as indicated by enhanced phosphorylation of whole PKA substrates, in particular, the hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) in adipocytes. As a result, the adipose tissue exhibited increased lipolysis, browning, and energy expenditure. Importantly, all of these effects were abolished upon treatment with the β3-adrenoceptor antagonist SR59230A. Collectively, these results demonstrate that transient overexpressed VEGF-A activates the sympathetic nervous system, which hence promotes lipolysis and browning in adipose tissue.Copyright © 2018 American Society for Microbiology.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30352954>Increased FGF21 in brown adipose tissue of  hydroxylase heterozygous mice: implications for cold adaptation.</a></h1><p> hydroxylase (TH) catalyzes the first step in catecholamines synthesis. We studied the impact of reduced TH in brown adipose tissue (BAT) activation. In adult heterozygous ( ) mice, dopamine and noradrenaline (NA) content in BAT decreased after cold exposure. This reduced catecholaminergic response did not impair cold adaptation, because these mice induced uncoupling protein 1 (UCP-1) and maintained BAT temperature to a similar extent than controls ( ). Possible compensatory mechanisms implicated were studied.  and  expression, key genes in BAT activation, were elevated in  mice at thermoneutrality from day 18.5 of embryonic life. Likewise, plasma FGF21 and liver  mRNA were increased. Analysis of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, a process that triggers elevations in FGF21, showed higher phospho-IRE1, phospho-JNK, and CHOP in BAT of  mice at thermoneutrality. Also, increased lipolysis in BAT of cold-exposure  mice was demonstrated by increased phosphorylation of hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL), as well as diacylglycerol (DAG) and FFA content. Overall, these results indicate that the mild effects of  haploinsufficiency on BAT function are likely due to compensatory mechanisms involving elevations in  and  and through adaptive changes in the  profile.Copyright © 2018 Vázquez et al.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29789036>Dietary CP and amino acid restriction has a different impact on the dynamics of protein, amino acid and  deposition in entire male, castrated and female pigs.</a></h1><p>Breeding efforts over the last decades altered markedly empty body (EB) composition of pigs. This study aimed to re-evaluate the dynamics of changes in the composition and deposition rate of , protein and amino acids (AA) in the EB from birth to 140 kg BW depending on the dietary CP and AA supply in a current pig genotype. In the experiment 66 entire male, 58 castrated and 66 female Swiss Large White pigs were used. From 20 kg BW onwards, they had either ad libitum access to a control (C) diet or a diet (LP) compared to diet C only 80% of CP, lysine, methione+cystine, threonine and tryptophan. The EB composition was determined at birth on eight boars and eight females, at 10 and 20 kg BW on two boars, two castrates and two females, and at 20 kg intervals from 40 to 140 kg BW, on four pigs per gender and dietary treatment. Each EB fraction was weighed and analysed for protein,  and AA profile. The AA-to-lysine ratio was calculated and the different chemical component contents were fitted to allometric regressions. Overall, C-boars had the greatest EB protein and AA content and deposition rates, and lowest  content and deposition rates. At the beginning of the grower period, LP-castrates and females displayed the lowest protein and AA and the highest  deposition rates. However, compared with their counterparts in the C-group, in LP-castrates and females protein and AA deposition rates were greater above 64 and 40 kg EB weight, respectively, whereas  deposition rates was lower above 80 kg EB weight. Thus, there seems a great potential to optimise protein and AA efficiency especially in the finisher period in castrates and females. Important individual variations were found in the essential AA-to-lysine ratio of the EB. Phenylalanine and threonine-to-lysine ratios decreased with increasing EB weight. Valine- and threonine-to-lysine ratios in C-castrates and C-females were 5% and 4% greater than recently reported by the National Research Council (NRC) whereas cysteine-, methionine- and -to-lysine ratios were lower by 34%, 25% and 10%, respectively. The clear differences found between the EB AA-to-lysine ratios in the present study and the NRC might partly be explained by the genotype and the temporal changes in the relative weight of each EB fraction or changes in the AA profile.

However, the psychological impact of these surgeries has not been fully studied. On one hand, surgical weight loss has been reported to improve standard quality of life and resolution of symptoms of depression. But on the other hand, reports of self-harm and increased ER visits for self-harm suggest other psychological difficulties. Inability to handle anxiety following surgical weight loss has alarming potential ramifications for these gastric surgery patients. In the present study, we used models of diet-induced obesity and vertical sleeve gastrectomy (VSG) to ask whether anxiety behavior and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis gene changes were affected by surgical weight loss under two diet regimens: i.e. low- diet (LFD) and high- diet (HFD). We show reduced exploratory behavior in the open field test but increased time in the open arms of the elevated plus maze. Furthermore, we show increased plasma levels of corticosterone in female VSG recipients in the estrus phase and increased levels of hypothalamic arginine-vasopressin (avp), pro-opiomelanocortin (pomc), and  hydroxylase (th). We report reduced dopamine receptor D1 (drd1) gene in prefrontal cortex (PFC) in VSG animals in comparison to Sham. Further we report diet-driven changes in stress-relevant gene targets in the hypothalamus (oxt, pomc, crhr1) and adrenal (nr3c1, nr3c2, mc2r). Taken together, these data suggest a significant impact of both surgical weight loss and diet on the HPA axis and further impact on behavior. Additional assessment is necessary to determine whether molecular and hormonal changes of surgical weight loss are the source of these findings.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30307770>Prominin-like, a homolog of mammalian CD133, suppresses di lp6 and TOR signaling to maintain body size and weight in Drosophila.</a></h1><p>CD133 (AC133/prominin-1) has been identified as a stem cell marker and a putative cancer stem cell marker in many solid tumors. Its biologic function and molecular mechanisms remain largely elusive. Here, we show that a fly mutant for prominin-like, a homolog of mammalian CD133, shows a larger body size and excess weight accompanied with higher  deposits as compared with the wild type. The expression levels of prominin-like are mediated by ecdysone signaling where its protein levels increase dramatically in the  body during metamorphosis. Prominin-like mutants exhibit higher Drosophila insulin-like peptide 6 (di lp6) levels during nonfeeding stages and increased Akt/ Drosophila target of rapamycin (dTOR) signaling. On an amino acid-restricted diet, prominin-like mutants exhibit a significantly larger body size than the wild type does, similar to that which occurs upon the activation of the dTOR pathway in the  body. Our data suggest that prominin-like functions by suppressing TOR and dilp6 signaling to control body size and weight.

Wistar rats were submitted to stereotaxic surgery and received a single intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection of artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF), OUA, or AR-A014418. After 7 days, the animals were submitted to open-field test. After behavioral analysis, the brains were dissected in frontal cortex and hippocampus to the evaluation of oxidative stress. The OUA induced manic-like behavior in rats, which was reversed by AR-A014418 treatment. The ICV administration of OUA increases the levels of superoxide in submitochondrial particles,  hydroperoxide (LPH), 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE), 8-isoprostane, protein carbonyl, 3-nitrotyrosine, and activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and glutathione reductase (GR) in both structures evaluated. In general, the treatment with AR-A014418 reversed these effects of OUA on the submitochondrial particles, LPH, 4-HNE, 8-isoprostane, protein carbonyl, 3-nitrotyrosine levels, and SOD activity. Furthermore, the injection of OUA decreased the catalase activity, and AR-A014418 promoted an increase in activity of this enzyme in the brain structures. These results suggest that GSK-3β inhibition can modulate manic-like behaviors. Also, it can be suggested that inhibition of GSK-3β can be effective against oxidative stress. However, more studies are needed to better elucidate these mechanisms.

In this study, a novel snake protein, metalloproteinase SP, was successfully isolated from the venom of   by multi-gel chromatography. The isolated protein exhibits anti-platelet aggregation activity. Animal experiments showed that it exhibited defibration, anticoagulation, and antithrombotic effects and contributes to improved blood rheology and antiplatelet aggregation. In vivo experiments demonstrated that it prolonged clotting time, partial thromboplastin time, prothrombin time, thrombin time, fibrinogen time and reduced fibrinogen content of mice. Also, metalloproteinase SP inhibited carrageenan-induced tail thrombosis, ADP-induced acute pulmonary embolism, and ADP, Arachidonic acid (AA), or collagen-induced platelet aggregation. In vitro experiments showed that the protein cleaved the α, β, and γ chains of fibrinogen. Metabolomic analysis upon metalloproteinase SP treatment revealed that 14 metabolites, which are mainly involved in phenylalanine, , and tryptophan biosynthesis, responded to metalloproteinase SP treatment. In summary, the isolated snake venom protein inhibits formation of acute pulmonary embolism probably through regulating and restoring perturbed energy, , and amino acid .</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31525931>Integrated Non-targeted and Targeted Metabolomics Uncovers Dynamic Metabolic Effects during Short-Term Abstinence in Methamphetamine Self-Administering Rats.</a></h1><p>Persistent neurochemical disturbances by repeating drug reward and withdrawal lead to addiction. Particularly, drug withdrawal, usually starting within hours of the last dose, is considered as a critical step in the transition to addiction and a treatment clue. The aim of this study was to uncover metabolic effects associated with methamphetamine (MA) short-term abstinence using both non-targeted and targeted metabolomics. Metabolic alterations were investigated in rat plasma collected immediately after 16 days of MA self-administration and after 12 and 24 h of abstinence. Principal component analysis revealed that the highest level of separation occurred between the 24 h and saline (control) groups based on the significantly changed ion features, 257/320/333 and 331/409/388, in the SA/12 h/24 h groups in positive and negative modes of UPLC-QTOF-ESI-MS, respectively. Targeted metabolomics revealed dynamic changes in the biosynthesis/ of amino acids, including the phenylalanine, , and tryptophan biosynthesis and the valine, leucine, and isoleucine biosynthesis. Integrating non-targeted and targeted metabolomics data uncovered rapid and distinct changes in the metabolic pathways involved in energy , the nervous system, and membrane . These findings provide essential knowledge of the dynamic metabolic effects associated with short-term MA abstinence and may help identify early warning signs of MA dependence.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30308090>Hypoxia-mediated alteration in cholesterol oxidation and raft dynamics regulates BDNF signalling and neurodegeneration in hippocampus.</a></h1><p>Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) which is primarily associated with neuronal survivability, differentiation and synaptic plasticity has been reported to mediate neurodegeneration in hypoxia through its p75 Neurotrophin receptors (p75NTR). The molecular events promoting BDNF-mediated pro-death signalling in hypoxia, however, still remain an enigma. This study attempts towards deciphering the signalling cascades involved in alteration of BDNF isoforms and its cognate receptor subtypes leading to neurodegeneration in hypoxia. Adult Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to global hypobaric hypoxia simulating an altitude of 7620 m at standard temperature and humidity. Chronic hypoxic exposure for 7 days resulted in higher expression of pro-BDNF and alteration in N-linked glycosylation in hippocampus along with increased expression of endoplasmic reticulum stress markers viz., glucose-regulated protein (Grp78), calnexin and changes in the endoplasmic reticulum morphology. Our findings reveal enriched expression of p75NTR in  rafts and higher expression of  receptor kinase β (Trkβ) in non-raft regions following hypoxic exposure. Further investigations on membrane properties revealed decline in membrane fluidity along with increased cholesterol oxidation resulting in reduced translocation of Trkβ from non-raft to raft regions. Supplementation of vitamin E during hypoxic exposure on the other hand reduced cholesterol oxidation and increased translocation of Trkβ from non-raft to raft regions and promoted neuronal survival. Hence, our findings suggest a novel mechanism of cholesterol oxidation-induced alteration in raft dynamics which is promotes p75 receptor-mediated death signalling in hippocampal neurons during chronic hypoxia.© 2018 International Society for Neurochemistry.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30729295>An investigation of oxidative stress and coenzyme Q10 levels in patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinomas.</a></h1><p>The purpose of this study was to determine the oxidative states of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients by measuring their plasma levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), an indicator of  peroxidation, 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT), an indicator of protein oxidation, and the coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), an important antioxidant, and compare them with healthy individuals.The plasma MDA, 3-NT and CoQ10 levels of 35 patients and 20 healthy individuals were measured with the high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method. By comparing the patients' smoking habits, stage of the disease, size of the primary tumor and the presence of lymph nodes and the values of healthy individuals, the oxidative stress load of HNSCC patients was determined.The mean plasma MDA levels of carcinoma patients were two times higher than those of healthy individuals (p < 0.001). When the mean plasma 3-NT levels of patients and healthy individuals were compared, no significant difference was found (p > 0.05). The mean plasma CoQ10 level of patients was low when compared with healthy individuals; however, no significant difference was detected (p > 0.05). In addition, as the stage and tumor size increased in HNSCC patients, their non-enzymatic antioxidant levels significantly decreased (p < 0.05).In HNSCC patients, lipo-oxidative damage increased while nitrosative stress did not change; however, antioxidant activity decreased which in turn increased both  peroxidation and oxidative stress. These findings support the contention that oxidative stress strongly reflects the health status of HNSCC patients.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30931941>Integrin activation by the  molecule 25-hydroxycholesterol induces a proinflammatory response.</a></h1><p>Integrins are components of cell-matrix adhesions, and function as scaffolds for various signal transduction pathways. So far no  ligand for integrin has been reported. Here we show that a , oxysterol 25-hydroxycholesterol (25HC), directly binds to α5β1 and αvβ3 integrins to activate integrin-focal adhesion kinase (FAK) signaling. Treatment of macrophages and epithelial cells with 25HC results in an increase in activated αvβ3 integrin in podosome and focal adhesion matrix adhesion sites. Moreover, activation of pattern recognition receptor on macrophages induces secretion of 25HC, triggering integrin signaling and the production of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF and IL-6. Thus, the  molecule 25HC is a physiologically relevant activator of integrins and is involved in positively regulating proinflammatory responses. Our data suggest that extracellular 25HC links innate immune inflammatory response with integrin signaling.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29901076> raft‑associated β‑adducin participates in neutrophil migration.</a></h1><p>Previous studies have demonstrated that  rafts and β‑adducin serve an important role in leukocyte rolling. In the present study the migratory ability and behavior of neutrophils was demonstrated to rely on the integrity of the  raft structure. β‑adducin was demonstrated to have a critical role in neutrophil migration. Knockdown of β‑adducin attenuated the migratory ability of dHL‑60 cells and the distribution of β‑adducin in  raft structures was changed by N‑formylmethionyl‑leucyl‑phenyl‑alanine treatment. Furthermore, the findings demonstrated that the  phosphorylation of β‑adducin was required for its relocation. The results of the present study suggested that the  raft‑associated protein β‑adducin may be a novel control point for the excessive infiltration of neutrophils during inflammation.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30875680>Vertical sleeve gastrectomy improves liver and hypothalamic functions in obese mice.</a></h1><p>Vertical sleeve gastrectomy (VSG) is an effective surgery to treat obesity and diabetes. However, the direct effect of VSG on metabolic functions is not fully understood. We aimed to investigate if alterations in hypothalamic neurons were linked with perturbations in liver  after VSG in an energy intake-controlled obese mouse model. C57BL/6 and hrNPY-GFP reporter mice received HFD for 12 weeks and were then divided into three groups: Sham (ad lib), sham (pair-fed) with VSG, and VSG. Food intake was measured daily, and blood glucose levels were measured before and after the study. Energy expenditure and body composition were determined. Serum parameters, liver  and glycogen contents were measured, and gene/protein expression were analyzed. Hypothalamic POMC, AgRP/NPY, and  hydroxylase expressing neurons were counted. As results, we found that VSG reduced body weight gain and adiposity induced by HFD, increased energy expenditure independent of energy intake. Fed and fasted blood glucose levels were reduced in the VSG group. While serum active GLP-1 level was increased, the active ghrelin and triglycerides levels were decreased along with improved insulin resistance in VSG group. Liver  accumulation, glycogen content, and gluconeogenic gene expression were reduced in the VSG group. In the hypothalamus, TH expressing neuron population was decreased, and the POMC-expressing neuron population was increased in the VSG group. Our data suggests that VSG improves metabolic symptoms by increasing energy expenditure and lowering  and glycogen contents in the liver. These physiological alterations are possibly related to changes in hypothalamic neuron populations.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31672146>Short-term treatment with high dose liraglutide improves  and lipoprotein profile and changes hormonal mediators of  in obese patients with no overt type 2 diabetes mellitus: a randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over, double-blind clinical trial.</a></h1><p>Long-term treatment with up to 1.8 mg liraglutide improves cardiovascular and all-cause mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes at high risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and is currently under investigation in subjects without diabetes. Aim of our study was to investigate whether high dose (3 mg) short-term (5 weeks) treatment with liraglutide in obese patients with no overt type 2 diabetes affects metabolites,  and lipoprotein profile and components of activin-follistatin axis in cardiovascular beneficial or detrimental way.Twenty obese patients participated in a randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over, double-blind study and were administrated liraglutide 3 mg or placebo for 5 weeks. Metabolites, fatty acids, -lipoprotein profile and concentrations of activins and follistatins (250 parameters) were assessed in serum at start and completion of each treatment.Concentrations of important cardiovascular markers such as total, free and remnant cholesterol were reduced with liraglutide before and after adjusting for weight loss. Similarly, reductions in number of small and medium size LDL particles and in their total  concentration were observed with liraglutide and partially weight-loss related.  levels were reduced and behenic acid levels were increased whereas only minor changes were observed in HDL, VLDL and IDL. Concentrations of activin AB and follistatin were significantly reduced in liraglutide-treated group.Treatment of obese patients without overt type 2 diabetes with high dose of liraglutide for a short period of time induces changes in -lipoprotein and hormonal profile that are suggestive of lower risk of atherosclerosis and CVD.

Obesity is known to increase the risk of periodontitis and adipokines have been suggested to be a pathomechanistic link. This study examines if obesity-associated stimuli have regulatory effects on TH levels in periodontal cells and tissues. Human periodontal ligament fibroblasts were cultured in the presence of leptin or visfatin for up to 2 days. Untreated cells served as control. TH regulation was analyzed by real-time PCR, immunocytochemistry and ELISA. TH gene expression in periodontal tissues of normal-weight and obese rodents was determined. Examination of gingival biopsies from rats and patients with and without periodontal disease was performed by real-time PCR or immunohistochemistry. For statistics, ANOVA and post hoc tests were applied (p < 0.05). In vitro, TH gene expression and protein levels were increased by leptin and visfatin. In vivo, TH gene expression was upregulated in periodontal tissues of obese rodents as compared to normal-weight animals. Additionally, increased TH gene expression was found in rat gingival biopsies with experimental periodontitis. Human gingival biopsies from sites of periodontitis confirmed the animal data by demonstrating elevated TH levels at periodontally diseased sites. This study provides original evidence that obesity-associated stimuli induce a TH upregulation in periodontal cells and tissues. Since TH levels were also increased at periodontitis sites, our in vitro and animal findings suggest that this enzyme could represent a pathomechanism whereby obesity contributes to periodontitis.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31289671>Global serum metabolomics profiling of colorectal cancer.</a></h1><p>Accurate diagnosis of colorectal cancer (CRC) relies on the use of invasive tools such as colonoscopy and sigmoidoscopy. Non-invasive tools are less sensitive in detecting the disease, particularly in the early stage. A number of researchers have used metabolomics analyses on serum/plasma samples of patients with CRC compared with normal healthy individuals in an effort to identify biomarkers for CRC. The aim of the present review is to compare reported serum metabolomics profiles of CRC and to identify common metabolites affected among these studies. A literature search was performed to include any experimental studies on global metabolomics profile of CRC using serum/plasma samples published up to March 2018. The Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS) tool was used to assess the quality of the studies reviewed. In total, nine studies were included. The studies used various analytical platforms and were performed on different populations. A pathway enrichment analysis was performed using the data from all the studies under review. The most affected  identified were protein biosynthesis, urea cycle, ammonia recycling, alanine , glutathione  and citric acid cycle. The metabolomics analysis revealed levels of metabolites of glycolysis, tricarboxylic acid cycle, anaerobic respiration, protein, lipid and glutathione  were significantly different between cancer and control samples. Although the majority of differentiating metabolites identified were different in the different studies, there were several metabolites that were common. These metabolites include pyruvic acid, glucose, lactic acid, malic acid, fumaric acid, 3-hydroxybutyric acid, tryptophan, phenylalanine, , creatinine and ornithine. The consistent dysregulation of these metabolites among the different studies suggest the possibility of common diagnostic biomarkers for CRC.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30050068>Automated analysis of  drug-response markers by combined fast and high-resolution whole cell MALDI mass spectrometry biotyping.</a></h1><p>Recent advances in matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry have enabled whole cell-MALDI mass spectrometry biotyping of drug-treated cultured cells for rapid monitoring of known abundant pharmacodynamic protein markers such as polyacetylated histones. In contrast, generic and automated analytical workflows for discovery of such pharmacodynamic markers, in particular  markers, and their use in cellular tests of drug-like compounds are still lacking. Here, we introduce such a workflow and demonstrate its utility for cellular drug-response monitoring of BCR-ABL  kinase inhibitors in K562 leukemia cells: First, low-molecular mass features indicating drug responses are computationally extracted from groups of MALDI-TOF mass spectra. Then, the lipids/metabolites corresponding to these features are identified by MALDI-Fourier transformation mass spectrometry. To demonstrate utility of the method, we identify the potassium adduct of phosphatidylcholine PC(36:1) as well as heme B, a marker for erythroid differentiation, as markers for a label-free MALDI MS-based test of cellular responses to BCR-ABL inhibitors. Taken together, these results suggest that MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry of lipids and other low molecular mass metabolites could support cell-based drug profiling.</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30029554>Impact of Long-Term RF-EMF on Oxidative Stress and Neuroinflammation in Aging Brains of C57BL/6 Mice.</a></h1><p>The expansion of mobile phone use has raised questions regarding the possible biological effects of radiofrequency electromagnetic field (RF-EMF) exposure on oxidative stress and brain inflammation. Despite accumulative exposure of humans to radiofrequency electromagnetic fields (RF-EMFs) from mobile phones, their long-term effects on oxidative stress and neuroinflammation in the aging brain have not been studied. In the present study, middle-aged C57BL/6 mice (aged 14 months) were exposed to 1950 MHz electromagnetic fields for 8 months (specific absorption rate (SAR) 5 W/kg, 2 h/day, 5 d/week). Compared with those in the young group, levels of protein (3-nitro-) and  (4-hydroxy-2-nonenal) oxidative damage markers were significantly increased in the brains of aged mice. In addition, levels of markers for DNA damage (8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine, p53, p21, γH2AX, and Bax), apoptosis (cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP-1)), astrocyte (GFAP), and microglia (Iba-1) were significantly elevated in the brains of aged mice. However, long-term RF-EMF exposure did not change the levels of oxidative stress, DNA damage, apoptosis, astrocyte, or microglia markers in the aged mouse brains. Moreover, long-term RF-EMF exposure did not alter locomotor activity in aged mice. Therefore, these findings indicate that long-term exposure to RF-EMF did not influence age-induced oxidative stress or neuroinflammation in C57BL/6 mice.</p></html>
