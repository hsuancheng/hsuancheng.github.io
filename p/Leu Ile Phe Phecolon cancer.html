<html><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18436344>The synthesis and anticancer activity of selected diketopiperazines.</a></h1><p>Six selected diketopiperazines, cyclo(Gly-Val), cyclo(Gly-D-Val), cyclo(Gly-), cyclo(Gly-), cyclo(-Cys) and cyclo(Tyr-Cys), were synthesized via various synthetic routes. Their potential to inhibit  cell growth in HT-29, HeLa and MCF-7 cells was determined. Cyclo(Tyr-Cys) caused the greatest inhibition in cervical carcinoma cells with near equivalent activity against HT-29 and MCF-7 cells. The other cyclic dipeptides tested were effective in the inhibition of , cervical and breast carcinoma cells, respectively, but the percentage inhibition was lower than for cyclo(Tyr-Cys).</p><h1><a href=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23266186>Inhibitory effect of novel somatostatin peptide analogues on human  cell growth based on the selective inhibition of DNA polymerase β.</a></h1><p>The present study was designed to investigate the anticancer activity of novel nine small peptides (compounds 1-9) derived from TT-232, a somatostatin structural analogue, by analyzing the inhibition of mammalian DNA polymerase (pol) and human  cell growth. Among the compounds tested, compounds 3 [tert-butyloxycarbonyl (Boc)-Tyr--1-naphthylamide], 4 (Boc-Tyr--1-naphthylamide), 5 (Boc-Tyr--1-naphthylamide) and 6 (Boc-Tyr-Val-1-naphthylamide) containing tyrosine (Tyr) but no carboxyl groups, selectively inhibited the activity of rat pol β, which is a DNA repair-related pol. Compounds 3-6 strongly inhibited the growth of human  carcinoma HCT116 p53(+/+) cells. The influence of compounds 1-9 on HCT116 p53(-/-) cell growth was similar to that observed for HCT116 p53(+/+) cells. These results suggest that the  cell growth suppression induced by these compounds might be related to their inhibition of pol. Compound 4 was the strongest inhibitor of pol β and  cell growth among the nine compounds tested. This compound specifically inhibited rat pol β activity, but had no effect on the other 10 mammalian pols investigated. Compound 4 combined with methyl methane sulfonate (MMS) treatment synergistically suppressed HCT116 p53(-/-) cell growth compared with MMS alone. This compound also induced apoptosis in HCT116 cells with or without p53. From these results, the influence of compound 4, a specific pol β inhibitor, on the relationship between DNA repair and  cell growth is discussed.Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, genetic alterations of the hMSH2 gene were examined in 43 ovarian, 36 non-small cell lung (NSCL), 31 poorly differentiated gastric, 15 endometrial, and 11  cancers, nine gastric  cell lines, 41 adult T-cell leukemias (ATLs), two ATL cell lines, and 37 non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHLs), using polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) technique. Microsatellite instability (MSI) was also investigated for ovarian, NSCL, and  cancers. The incidence of MSI was 1/36 (3%) for NSCL, 2/23 (9%) for ovarian, and 1/11 (9%) for  cancers. Missense base changes of the hMSH2 gene were identified in two gastric  patients (ATG to ATA resulting in Met changing to  at codon 688 in exon 13 and ACA to GCA resulting in Thr changing to Ala at codon 803 in exon 14). These mutations were found in samples with no MSI. One ovarian and one gastric , and six ATL samples showed two types of polymorphisms of hMSH2 (CTT to TTT resulting in  changing to  at codon 390 in exon 7 and CAG to AAG resulting in Gin to Arg at codon 419 in exon 7). Our data suggest that MSI and hMSH2 mutations are uncommon in sporadic tumors.</p></html>
